    "text": "[2]A multi-faceted, multi-year investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police into the activities of the Hells Angels led to the identification of a broad range of acts that could constitute criminal offences. Some of the offences fell within the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the provincial Crown, while others fell within that of the federal Crown. [3]The provincial prosecutions proceeded to trial in 2008 in the British Columbia Supreme Court before Romilly J. and a jury. The appellants, John Virgil Punko and Randall Richard Potts, and two others, Jean Joseph Violette and Ronaldo Lising, were tried jointly on varying charges of extortion, uttering threats, counselling mischief and unlawful possession of explosive substances and firearms. Some of the offences were allegedly committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, namely the Hells Angels. In July 2009, following a ten-month trial, a jury found each of the accused guilty of a number of offences; however, it acquitted all four of them on all the criminal organization counts. Romilly J. delivered two sets of sentencing reasons, the first concerning Messrs. Punko, Potts and Lising ), and the second, Mr. Violette (R. v. Violette, 2009 BCSC 1557 (CanLII)). [4]Meanwhile, a federal prosecution had been authorized. The appellants were charged individually with various drug-related offences, and on some of the counts — to the effect that they had produced and trafficked in a controlled substance (methamphetamine) — it was again alleged that they had done so for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization (the Hells Angels). A trial for the drug-related offences was scheduled before Leask J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court without a jury. On November 26, 2009, Leask J. heard pre-trial motions made by the appellants, who contended that the Crown should be estopped from leading evidence that the Hells Angels was a criminal organization, because the issue had already been decided by the jury in the provincial prosecution. [5]Leask J. granted the appellants' motions (2010 BCSC 70, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 232). He held that the standard to be applied in answering the question whether an issue was decided in a prior proceeding for the purposes of issue estoppel is that of \"proof on a balance of probabilities\" .",

    "text": "He held that the standard to be applied in answering the question whether an issue was decided in a prior proceeding for the purposes of issue estoppel is that of \"proof on a balance of probabilities\" . To determine whether issue estoppel applied, Leask J. considered the general circumstances of the case. First, he considered the fact that the jury had resolved its deliberations shortly after asking Romilly J. a question concerning the definition of a criminal organization . Second, Leask J. noted that Romilly J. had found in his reasons for sentence that Mr. Potts had been holding weapons for the Hells Angels (at para. 57) and that Mr. Violette had acted on behalf of the Hells Angels . On this second point, Leask J. was of the view that Romilly J. had found that the jury had acquitted Mr. Punko and Mr. Potts on the criminal organization counts because it was not satisfied that the Hells Angels was a criminal organization . Leask J. held that the Crown should be estopped from seeking to prove that the Hells Angels was a criminal organization in the trial before him. The Crown appealed. [6]The Court of Appeal allowed the appeals and ordered a new trial (2011 BCCA 55, 299 B.C.A.C. 235). Kirkpatrick J.A., writing for the court, found that Leask J. had erred in casting the question whether an issue was resolved in a prior proceeding in terms of burden of proof, as it is actually \"a question of logic and law\" . According to Kirkpatrick J.A., because individual jurors may have reached their decisions on the verdict by different routes, it could not be said that the only rational explanation for the verdict of acquittal was that the jury found that the Hells Angels was not a criminal organization . Nor did the nature and timing of the jury's question, or the sentencing judge's reasons, support a conclusion by a court in a subsequent proceeding that the issue of whether the Hells Angels was a criminal organization had necessarily been resolved by the jury. In Kirkpatrick J.A.'s opinion, the sentencing reasons did not \"unequivocally state the relevant finding on which the issue estoppel is based\" .",

    "text": "A.Evidence at Trial [6]A detailed review of the evidence is required because, in my view, this appeal is largely fact-driven. [7]The facts giving rise to the murder charge against the appellant are straightforward and, for the most part, uncontested. [8]On January 7, 2004, the appellant, then age 20, shot and killed Jeffrey Shuckburgh, the owner of a local bar in the City of Calgary. The murder weapon was a .22-calibre rifle that the appellant had stolen from his uncle's farm a few weeks earlier. At the time of the shooting, the appellant was cradling the barrel of the rifle in his left hand and had his right index finger poised to squeeze the trigger. According to eyewitnesses, just before the gun went off, Mr. Shuckburgh was about five feet from the appellant, and the appellant was pointing the gun at Mr. Shuckburgh's chest. A single shot was fired. It pierced Mr. Shuckburgh's heart. [9]In the several weeks leading up to the shooting, the appellant had been living at the home of a friend, Michael Stewart, and Michael's mother, Adina Stewart. Before moving in with the Stewarts, the appellant had been hospitalized for a few days in December 2003 under a mental health warrant. In her testimony, Ms. Stewart described the appellant as having \"developmental disabilities\". He was \"a little awkward socially\" and had \"a difficult time obtaining and keeping jobs\" (A.R., at p. 107). [10]As indicated, the murder weapon turned out to be a rifle the appellant had recently stolen from his uncle's farm. To avoid detection, the appellant had modified the rifle by cutting off its wooden stock. He and his friend Michael Stewart fired the gun on a few occasions before the shooting incident. The appellant concealed the weapon under his coat whenever he carried it in and out of the Stewart residence. [11]On the evening of the murder, the appellant and Michael Stewart consumed some beer at home and then headed to a nearby field to shoot the gun. Instead of going to the field, they decided to go to a local bar. The appellant concealed the rifle under his coat so that he could take it inside. [12]While at the bar, the appellant consumed more beer.",

[12]While at the bar, the appellant consumed more beer. He would later testify that his level of sobriety changed from \"tipsy\" to \"more so, more drunk or intoxicated\" over the course of the evening (A.R., at pp. 148 and 150). [13]A bartender noticed that the appellant was hiding something under his coat and confronted him. The appellant denied the allegation but then said that he was concealing a \"pellet gun\" (A.R., at p. 153). The appellant was told to leave the gun outside and he agreed to do so. Upon his return, the appellant walked up to the bar and opened his coat to show that the gun was no longer there. [14]The appellant was asked to leave the bar a second time because the staff believed he was disturbing some female patrons. The appellant protested but left without incident. He retrieved his rifle and went to a local convenience store where he purchased and ate a hamburger. [15]Minutes later, he went back to the bar, allegedly in search of Michael Stewart. This time, when he entered the bar, his demeanour was different. He was pacing back and forth. One witness said he seemed nervous. Another testified he appeared \"stunned\" and had a \"blank\" look on his face (A.R., at p. 84). The appellant readily admitted at trial that he was \"nervous\" when he returned to the bar for the third time (A.R., at p. 158): he knew that he was carrying the gun despite having been told that he was not allowed to have it in the bar. [16]A bartender noticed the appellant and escorted him out of the bar when he refused to leave. Mr. Shuckburgh and another employee assisted with the removal. In the process, the gun fell from the appellant's coat as he crossed the doorway. The appellant grabbed the gun with both hands. Cradling the barrel in his left hand and placing his right hand around the trigger at waist level, he pointed the rifle at Mr. Shuckburgh and the two employees.",

Cradling the barrel in his left hand and placing his right hand around the trigger at waist level, he pointed the rifle at Mr. Shuckburgh and the two employees. He slowly started backing down a ramp towards the street, while the bar personnel kept advancing toward him, telling him to\"get out of here\" (A.R., at p. 40).The appellant later testified that he was not planning to use the rifle: he just wanted to scare the three men who were after him. He said he was getting increasingly \"nervous\" and \"more scared\" and worried that Mr. Shuckburgh might find out where he lived and hurt him (A.R., at p. 168). [17]According to the two employees who were with Mr. Shuckburgh, the confrontation seemed over when the appellant suddenly started advancing back up the ramp towards them. At one point, the appellant rested his rifle on the top of a wall, sniper-style, turned it at one of the employees and said \"stern[ly]\": \"This isn't just a BB gun\" (A.R., at p. 40). The appellant later testified that he did so in order to scare the bar staff. [18]As the appellant eventually started moving back towards the bottom of the ramp, Mr. Shuckburgh continued to walk towards him. By this time, the two other bar employees had fallen back, leaving Mr. Shuckburgh in front facing the appellant. One of the two employees testified that the appellant would not step back unless Mr. Shuckburgh took a step forward. [19]The appellant testified that as he moved off the ramp onto a sidewalk, Mr. Shuckburgh began to walk faster towards him. In turn, the appellant stepped back faster. The next thing he knew, the gun \"went up . . . and it went off\" (A.R., at p. 177). When asked at trial if he intended for the gun to come up, the appellant replied: \"I don't know. I don't think so.\" Asked to explain what happened, he said: \"I don't know. . . . stupid thing went off\" (A.R., at p. 178). The appellant testified that his finger pulled the trigger, but that he did not mean for the gun to go off and did not want to shoot anyone. [20]Mr. Shuckburgh was about five feet away from the appellant when the gun went off.",

    "text": "The bullet pierced Mr. Shuckburgh's heart. The wound proved to be fatal. [21]After the shooting, the appellant ran to the Stewarts' residence. Ms. Stewart testified that the appellant told her that he had pulled out the gun, pointed it at the man who was advancing towards him and asked the man to leave him alone. As the man kept advancing, the appellant told Ms. Stewart that he panicked: \"Something went crazy in my head at that point\", and he pulled the trigger (A.R., at p. 100). [22]According to Ms. Stewart, the appellant initially seemed \"dazed\" but grew more agitated as he recounted the events that had led to the shooting (A.R., at p. 100). He took out the gun he had been hiding under his coat and began gesturing and waving the muzzle of the gun back and forth. Ms. Stewart testified that the appellant seemed \"very upset and very frightened\" about what he had done (A.R., at p. 110). At one point, according to Ms. Stewart, the appellant said that \"he wanted to kill himself, that he did not want to deal with what the consequences were of this . . . [to] spend years in jail and so on, so he would rather kill himself\" (A.R., at p. 104). [23]The police arrived quickly. They found the appellant outside of the Stewart home. He was non-responsive and appeared emotionless. He ignored commands to drop the gun and lie down on the ground and, with a \"blank\" look on his face, started walking backwards to the house while holding the gun in his right hand (A.R., at p. 116). Ultimately, he had to be tackled. [24]One of the police officers testified that it was apparent that the appellant had been drinking but he was not staggering or slurring his speech. He appeared to understand what was going on around him. In the officer's view, the appellant was not impaired. [25]At the station, having been arrested for murder, the appellant told an officer that he \"didn't mean to kill [Mr. Shuckburgh] (pause) on purpose\" and that he \"didn't mean to shoot anybody\" (R.R., at p. 87). He also made suicidal statements and asked an officer to shoot him or to give him his service revolver so that he could shoot himself.",

B.The Position of the Defence at Trial [26]The defence conceded at trial that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter. The only live issue at trial, according to defence counsel, was the appellant's intent when he pulled the trigger. As defence counsel explained in his closing submissions: The theory put forwardbythe defence is this: that Adrian Walle, on the night in question, in a nervous, shaky, highly agitated state, at a time when he consumed a certain amount of alcohol, and while being almost continually pursued and advanced upon by a numerically superior force, unintentionally discharged that .22 [rifle] at a time when it was pointed at Jeffrey Shuckburgh. [A.R., at pp. 198-99] [27]In urging the trial judge to find that the discharge of the gun was unintentional, defence counsel said that \"Mr. Walle, at the time when his finger pressed that trigger, did not mean to pull that trigger\" (A.R., at p. 212). In response to a question from the trial judge, defence counsel clarified his position as follows:",

    "text": "On March 24, 1990, the car the appellant was driving was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the scene of the accident, the police formed the opinion that the appellant was impaired, and demanded samples of his blood for analysis. They did not demand a breath sample because the appellant had some lacerations on his face and they thought that the presence of blood in the appellant's mouth might affect the accuracy of a breath sample analysis. The appellant agreed to the blood sample demand and was taken to a hospital where a nurse took the blood samples. At the hospital the appellant asked why blood samples were being taken; the investigating constable told him that two blood samples would be taken and that one was for police use while the other was kept for him in case he wanted to analyze it later on. The appellant was not charged with any offence at this time, although the investigating officer told the appellant that he would be charged with impaired driving in due course. The trial judge found, however, that in the circumstances the appellant did not have notice of the retention of the second blood sample, a point to which I shall return later. On May 22, 1990, some two months after the accident, the appellant was charged with two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm (Criminal Code, s. 255(2)) and one \"over 80\" count (driving with a blood-alcohol content of more than 80 mg per 100 ml of blood --Criminal Code, s. 253(b)). At the same time he was served with a Certificate of Analyst (CA) which revealed that he had had four times the statutory limit of concentration of alcohol in his blood at the time the samples were taken. The Certificate of Analyst did not mention the existence of a second blood sample. He was tried on September 21, 1990. In the six months between the time he gave blood samples and his trial, he neither requested the extra sample of his blood nor applied to any court for its release. The appellant was served with a Certificate of Qualified Technician (CQT) the day before his trial.",

    "text": "Hodgin's body was found on the morning of May 14, 1981, in a water-filled ditch near Stoney Creek, Ontario. Medical evidence was that he died as a result of heavy blows to the head. The time of death was estimated to be between 6:30 p.m. on May 13, 1981 and 6:30 a.m. on May 14, 1981. Greater precision was not possible as the body had been almost completely submerged in water. Hodgin had been seen leaving the Tap Room, a Hamilton bar, with the appellant Bevan at about 10:30 p.m. on May 13, 1981. There was no evidence of the appellant Griffith's having been at that bar on that evening, or of his being seen that night with Hodgin. The Crown's theory was that Griffith had been waiting in the area in a white car, and that after Bevan and Hodgin left the Tap Room the three drove to an unknown location, where the appellants beat Hodgin to death with tire irons. On May 2, 1981, about 11 days prior to the murder, Emily Ribble, a friend of the appellants, was assaulted by Hodgin. This was the alleged motive for the murder. It was conceded by both appellants that they were upset about the beating of Ribble by Hodgin. However, it was evident that a number of people had similar reasons to be upset with Hodgin. The evidence was that he had a history of spontaneous violence towards women, including a previous conviction for manslaughter arising out of the stabbing death of a girlfriend. In the weeks following the murder the police received information from several witnesses inculpating the appellants. But they considered the evidence too weak to support a charge. The investigation was suspended in early June 1981. In late February 1982, Patrick Belmont, who had been arrested for property offences committed with the appellants, approached the police saying he had information about the murder. He told the police about several incriminating conversations he had with Bevan. He agreed to wear a bodypack and attempt to elicit further incriminating statements from the appellants. The bodypack was suggested by the police because they viewed Belmont as unreliable. According to Belmont, he had further conversations with Bevan, and with Griffith, in which each of the appellants implicated themselves in the murder.",

According to Belmont, he had further conversations with Bevan, and with Griffith, in which each of the appellants implicated themselves in the murder. However, due to malfunctions of the bodypack equipment, only about 20 percent of the conversations were audible to the police, none of which was incriminating. In the spring of 1982, there was insufficient evidence to lay charges against the appellants, and the investigation was again discontinued. In August 1986, Stefan Dietrich, who was serving a three-year sentence at Warkworth Penitentiary, wrote to Sgt. Ryan of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Force that he had information concerning Hodgin's murder. The investigation was reactivated. At the time of the murder, Dietrich was a 16-year-old chronic drug and alcohol abuser living with the appellant Griffith. Dietrich testified that one evening in May 1981, the appellants left together in a car. The next day, Dietrich was asked to help the appellants clean out the car, whose trunk contained two tire irons and a blood-soaked carpet. Dietrich put all of the contents from the trunk into green garbage bags, and placed the bags at the front of Griffith's driveway for municipal garbage pickup. Dietrich also testified to a number of incriminating statements made by the appellants, particularly Griffith. The appellants were arrested in September 1986. At their trial they testified in their own defence, denying or explaining the inculpatory statements allegedly made in the presence of Dietrich, Belmont, and/or other witnesses. As well each of them offered alibi defences. The appellants admitted in their testimony at trial that each had lied in statements to the police. After his September 1986 arrest, the appellant Griffith gave a statement exculpating himself but inculpating Bevan. At his trial, Griffith denied the truth of the parts of his statement inculpating Bevan, stating that he was confused when he gave the statement and told the police what he thought they wanted to hear because he was scared. The appellant Bevan did not give the police a statement in 1986, but in a statement made to them shortly after the murder, he falsely stated he and Ribble had gone to Ribble's mother's on May 13, 1981.",

There was evidence, some admitted and some denied by Bevan, that he had asked other witnesses to lie to the police about various matters related to his conduct around the date of the murder. Crucial evidence against the appellants was the testimony of Dietrich, and, to a lesser extent, Belmont. In her charge to the jury, the trial judge noted credibility was important in this case, discussed generally how credibility should be assessed, and made some references to factors affecting the credibility of Belmont and Dietrich. She did not, however, in the language ofVetrovecgive a clear sharp warning to the jury as to its being dangerous to convict the appellants on the basis of the evidence of Belmont and Dietrich unless their evidence was supported by other evidence. Nor did she instruct the jury on the use that could be made of prior inconsistent statements. Dietrich's letter of August 1986 was read aloud by him during his direct examination. It contained a number of statements prejudicial to the appellants. Defence counsel then used the letter in cross-examination to attack Dietrich's testimony and credibility, on the basis of Dietrich's apparent animosity towards the appellants and his motivations for lying to the police and at trial.

    "text": "At the outset, its worth repeating that a jury charge should not be microscopically examined and parsed. There is no such thing as a perfect jury charge. Rather, the directions to the jury must be looked at as a whole to determine if there has been any error. See, for example,R. v. W.(D.),[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at p. 758. When read as a whole, it can be seen that the charge is eminently fair. Although it is not determinative, it is significant that the Crown made no objection at trial to this aspect of the charge. Indeed, as the Court of Appeal observed it is doubtful that this direction, if it stood alone, would justify the granting of a new trial. A review of the directions makes it crystal clear that the jury was instructed to consider the evidence as a whole and not in piecemeal fashion. Indeed in dealing with the circumstantial evidence, it is significant that the trial judge instructed the jury to consider that evidence in the context of the Crown and defence theories and in relation to the evidence as a whole. The following are examples of the instructions to the jury which were eminently sound and correct in dealing with the evidence:",

The police began to follow the appellant with the emergency signals on the cruiser activated. The appellant then accelerated and drove through two more stop signs. He stopped at an apartment parking lot, where he was followed by police. The police officer, who then recognized the appellant, saw him rapidly getting out of his car and running towards the back door of an apartment. The policeman stepped out of his car and screamed, \"Doug Macooh, stop running. Get back here. We'd like to speak to you.\" The appellant entered the apartment. The police officer went to the back door of the apartment and called Doug Macooh inside the apartment. He received no answer. He identified himself as being a member of the RCMP and still receiving no answer, he entered the apartment. From the bedroom, the police officer heard a male voice whispering, \"Tell him that I was here all night long with you\". A woman answered, \"No, Doug\". The policeman proceeded into the bedroom and found the accused in bed with Miss Kimberley Pack. The appellant was told he was under arrest for failure to stop for a police officer. The appellant repeatedly refused to follow the officer and also refused to get dressed. As the police officer was forcing the appellant to get dressed, an altercation took place, during which the policeman could observe the usual signs of impairment. The appellant was arrested. A demand for a breath sample was made and was refused. The appellant was charged with impaired driving, failing to stop for a peace officer, failing to submit to a breathalyser test, and assaulting a peace officer.",

They are as follows: On the early morning of March 10, 1982, the back door entrance of 655 Archibald Street, a building housing the business known as Ernie's Gun Shop Ltd., was tampered with and damaged. The silent alarm in the building was triggered and two police cruisers arrived at the scene within minutes of each other. The first officers who arrived disturbed two men in the vicinity of the rear entrance of the building. One of the men ran off in a northerly direction carrying what appeared to be a tire iron, and the second man ran off in a southerly direction, turning east toward Archibald Street. The individual with the tire iron was not apprehended, although a tire iron was located nearby the next morning. Paint chips on the tire iron were the same colour as the damaged door, and the iron itself appeared to fit into the nicks which had been created when the door was tampered with. The individual who ran off in a southerly direction was seen by police officers in a second police car, was followed by them, and ultimately apprehended. He is the accused, Schuldt. All the police officers involved positively identified the accused, and the print of his footwear was matched with imprints in the snow around the back entrance of the gun shop. After his arrest Mr. Schuldt was interrogated by the police and made only one statement of any consequence, which was admitted in evidence.",

In response to a request to use the phone the investigating officers asked him what he wanted to use it for, and the accused replied, \"to phone home\", to which the police officer responded, \"to call your brother?\", to which Mr. Schuldt replied, \"He's a faster runner\". 5.Before entering upon an analysis of the trial judgment, I think it would be desirable to set out the sections that the trial judge was called upon to apply to the facts. 6.Section 306(1)(a) of theCriminal Codemakes it an offence to \"break[s] and enter[s] a place with intent to commit an indictable offence therein\". 7.Supporting the Crown in its burden of proving the intent for breaking and entering is s. 306(2)(a), which enacts that: 306.. . . (2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused (a) broke and entered a place is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke and entered with intent to commit an indictable offence therein: . . . 8.The charge being one of attempt, regard must be had to s. 24: 24.(1) Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under the circumstances to commit the offence. (2) The question whether an act or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit the offence, is a question of law. 9.It is common ground that what was done to the door went beyond mere preparation. It is also common ground that the presumption of s. 306(2) is not triggered by an attempt, and we are, therefore, not invited to consider whether proof of a break coupled with proof of an intent to enter would beprima facieproof of an intent to commit therein an indictable offence. Indeed, the Crown adopted what was said inR. v.",

At the suggestion of Crown counsel, the matter was adjourned to November 8, 1988. On November 8, an agent for counsel for the appellant requested an adjournment to permit defence counsel to arrange a pre‐trial, and the matter was accordingly adjourned to December 6, 1988. On December 6, 1988, the charge was further adjourned to January 31, 1989 for a pre‐trial. Counsel for the appellant estimated that the preliminary hearing would require five days and that it was likely that a great deal of scientific evidence would be called at that time. Crown counsel requested that the pre‐trial judge be permitted to read the Crown brief prior to the pre‐trial. The court approved this request as consistent with the \"usual practice.\" Trial counsel for the appellant consented to the request but advised the court that all of the Crown's scientific reports were not yet available and that this evidence was crucial to the resolution of the case. He also indicated that the pre‐trial judge would likely require two days to read the Crown brief. Both counsel agreed to January 31, 1989 as a date for the pre‐trial conference. The pre‐trial conference was held on January 31, 1989. It was conducted in the pre‐trial judge's chambers and no transcript is available. However, court resumed once the pre‐trial had been completed, and counsel for the Crown and defence spoke to the provincial judge about setting a date for trial or for a preliminary hearing. The judge indicated that five days would be required for a preliminary and suggested September or October 1989, subject to counsel's availability. Because the appellant was not present in court on this date, the matter was adjourned to February 7, 1989 to set the trial date.",

October 2, 1989 through October 6, 1989 were set for the trial or preliminary hearing. Counsel for the appellant declined to elect a trial or preliminary hearing for that date because he did not have all the material, which suggests that some, but not full, disclosure had been made. On February 14, 1989, the appellant appeared in court and the week of October 2 to 6 was confirmed. On October 2, 1989 the appellant elected to be tried by a court composed of judge and jury and the preliminary hearing commenced.

On January 17, 1990, Crown counsel was unable to attend the pre‐trial conference due to a conflicting commitment, and the pre‐trial was adjourned.

The pre‐trial conference was held on May 2, 1990. The issues were discussed and the matter was adjourned to June 5, 1990 to set a date for trial. At assignment court on June 5, 1990, defence counsel indicated to the court that the trial would likely last ten days and that an out‐of‐town judge was required. According to counsel for the appellant, an out‐of‐town judge was necessary because all the judges in the jurisdiction knew the family of the deceased. It is agreed that, in the circumstances, this request was reasonable. The trial co‐ordinator made it clear that the trial date would be set and that a judge from outside Sudbury would then be found to preside at the trial. The date of December 3, 1990 was suggested as an appropriate date, but defence counsel expressed a preference for a January 1991 date as he had other commitments in December. At defence counsel's suggestion, the matter was adjourned to July 3, 1990 in order for counsel to make appropriate arrangements about a date. During June, 1990, counsel for the appellant and respondent met with Loukidelis J. in chambers and agreed to the dates of December 3 to 10 for the trial. The affidavit of Greg Rodgers, Assistant Crown Attorney, states that \"[i]f the matter was shorter and could be heard by a local Judge a trial date could have been obtained within 3 months\". On July 3, 1990, it was decided that the trial would proceed on December 3, 1990.

There is accordingly no evidence before this Court regarding delay during the appellate period, but for the purposes of setting out the time frame, the following dates from the factum of the appellant are accepted as fact.

The trial judge found that the police surveillance evidence of June 17, 1989 did not advance the Crown's case, but that the surveillance evidence of June 19, 20, and 28, 1989, and of July 3 to 7, 1989, established a relationship between the appellant and Manolio. There was further surveillance evidence which showed an association between the appellant and two men, Zevallos and Narvaez. Part of this evidence was that on July 7, 1989, the appellant and Manolio drove in a Mazda registered in the name of Zevallos to a school lot and then parked behind a Mustang a short distance from the lot. Narvaez, who was a passenger in the Mustang, approached the appellant and Manolio. The appellant, after a short conversation with Narvaez, went to the passenger side of the Mazda and took out a white plastic bag. He handed the bag to Narvaez, who then got into a Toyota. The police followed and stopped the Toyota. The other occupant of the Toyota, Zevallos, was at that time found in possession of one kilogram of cocaine and $4,200 in Canadian money. The cocaine was contained in a bag which, at least on the surface, did not appear to be similar to the package handed to Narvaez by the appellant. The police arrested the appellant later on July 7, 1989. The appellant was found upon his arrest to have approximately $306,000 in cash in the trunk of the car he was driving. At the same time the police searched an Oldsmobile Toronado (which the appellant had been observed driving on July 3, 1989), and found 15 kilograms of cocaine. The evidence indicated that Manolio had more frequent contact with this car than had the appellant. The evidence disclosed that on a number of occasions from April to July 1989, the appellant was in possession of large amounts of Canadian currency, which he was exchanging for U.S. currency and Swiss francs. The total amount of currency that the appellant was shown to have handled over this period was in excess of $700,000 Canadian. The Crown's theory was that Manolio was the person who did the actual trafficking in narcotics and that the appellant handled the money.",

The appellant called evidence at trial in an attempt to explain the large amounts of cash he had handled over the period in question. It was claimed that the appellant and his brother, who lives in Argentina, were conducting a currency exchange business. The appellant's brother testified that this business involved buying Argentinean money with U.S. dollars on the Argentinean black market, then using the Argentinean money to purchase Canadian dollars on the black market, and finally shipping the Canadian money to Canada to be exchanged for U.S. dollars. The appellant's brother stated that the difference between the value of Canadian and U.S. currency on the Argentinean black market would result in this type of circular exchange yielding a substantial profit, a claim supported by the expert testimony of an economist. The appellant also called as witnesses a relative who testified to having acted on one occasion as a courier of Canadian currency between Argentina and Canada for the appellant and his brother, and an Argentinean who testified to having lent $400,000 U.S. to the appellant's brother. The appellant did not testify. The appellant's trial was conducted intermittently over 20 days from November 16, 1989 to July 3, 1990. At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the appellant moved to have the charges dismissed on the basis that the Crown had failed to adduce any evidence to prove the essential elements of the offences. The trial judge dismissed that motion on April 2, 1990. In the course of his oral reasons for denying the motion, the trial judge commented upon having difficulty dealing with the case because of the intermittent nature of the trial proceedings and that he had to rely entirely on his notes. Three months later, on July 3, 1990, the trial judge delivered judgment with oral reasons. In rendering his verdict the trial judge again commented on the sporadic nature of the proceedings but his comments did not indicate that he had the same difficulty in dealing with the evidence as he had in April.",

The trial judge then convicted the appellant on the conspiracy, trafficking and possession of narcotics charges, and acquitted him on the proceeds-related charges. On July 25, 1990, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to nine years' imprisonment. In considering the trial judge's decision to acquit the appellant on the proceeds-related charges, it is helpful to divide the proceeds-related charges into separate groups based on the time periods involved. The proceeds-related charges against the appellant were counts 6 to 24 on the information dated November 16, 1989. Counts 6 to 11 and 22 involved allegations of unlawful possession of the proceeds of narcotic trafficking, and of laundering the proceeds of narcotic trafficking, between April 28, 1989 and May 24, 1989 (\"the pre-July counts\"). Counts 12 to 21 and 24 involved allegations of similar illegal conduct by the appellant in early July 1989 (\"the July counts\").

A group including the appellant, Marc Creighton, and the deceased, Ms. Martin, consumed a large quantity of alcohol and cocaine that night. In the afternoon of the following day, the appellant, a companion (Frank Caddedu) and the deceased planned to share a quantity of cocaine at the deceased's apartment. The evidence indicates that all of the parties involved were experienced cocaine users. The appellant obtained an \"eight-ball\" (3.5 gr.) of cocaine. He did not seek to determine the quality or potency of the cocaine before injecting the drug intravenously into himself and Frank Caddedu. With the consent of the deceased, the appellant then injected a quantity of cocaine into the deceased's right forearm. She immediately began to convulse violently and appeared to cease breathing. Subsequent expert testimony confirmed that, as a result of the injection, she had experienced a cardiac arrest, and later asphyxiated on the contents of her stomach. Both the appellant and Mr. Caddedu attempted unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ms. Martin. Mr. Caddedu indicated he wanted to call for emergency assistance but the appellant, by verbal intimidation, convinced Mr. Caddedu not to call 911. The appellant placed the deceased, who was still convulsing, on her bed. The appellant then proceeded to clean the apartment of any possible fingerprints. The two men then left the apartment. Mr. Caddedu returned unaccompanied to the deceased's apartment six or seven hours later and called for emergency assistance. Ms. Martin was thereupon pronounced dead. The appellant related a substantially different version of the events in question, but this testimony was disbelieved by the trial judge. The appellant was charged with manslaughter. Defence counsel conceded at trial that the injection into the deceased's body constituted \"trafficking\" within the meaning of s. 4(1) of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. The Crown argued that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter as Ms. Martin's death was the direct consequence of an unlawful act, contrary tos. 222(5)(a) of theCriminal Code. The appellant was convicted of manslaughter on May 18, 1990, and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The appellant appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which affirmed the conviction.",

The customer identified himself as Tony Bowers. The appellant learned over the police radio that this information was false. Based on papers that he was carrying, the individual was identified as Tony Griffin, for whom there was an arrest warrant outstanding. The appellant then arrested Mr. Griffin and brought him to the police station. The officers also received from the cab driver a bag belonging to Mr. Griffin which contained approximately 150 packs of cigarettes. The officers suspected that these cigarettes had come into the possession of Mr. Griffin illegally. Upon arriving at the station, Ms. Campbell went to retrieve the cigarettes from the trunk of the car, the appellant opened the rear door to let Mr. Griffin out, and at that moment, Mr. Griffin attempted to flee. The appellant chased after him, taking his gun out of its holster as he ran. The gun was held at the side of his right leg, pointing at the ground. The appellant yelled in the direction of Mr. Griffin, \"Stop or I'll shoot.\" The appellant then pointed his gun at Mr. Griffin with his index finger on the trigger. He claimed that he did this in order to intimidate Mr. Griffin because he was not responding to the order to stop. The Crown's position, however, is that Mr. Griffin had already stopped running forward and had begun running on the spot \"dodging like a boxer\", when he turned to face the appellant. At that moment, a shot went off, fatally striking Mr. Griffin in the head. These events all took place in the police station parking lot. The gun used by the appellant can be fired either by \"single action\", where the gun is already cocked and only slight pressure on the trigger is required, or by \"double action\", requiring very strong pressure on the trigger so as to raise the hammer and then fire a shot. The appellant was charged with manslaughter underss. 234and236of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(formerly ss. 217 and 219).",

The Crown proceeded by indictment. The evidence established that Peter Naglik, then aged 11 weeks, was brought to hospital where he was found to have sustained a number of serious injuries (including a broken collarbone, fractured ribs in at least 15 places, a fractured vertebra, two separate skull fractures, and haemorrhaging of the brain and the retina) which had caused permanent damage. The injuries had been sustained over a period of time, estimated by physicians to be four weeks. Naglik gave exculpatory statements concerning her child's condition to police and other authorities which were inconsistent with the medical evidence at trial. At trial before a judge and jury, Naglik did not testify. Pople did testify, denying any involvement in causing the injuries to the child, and claiming that Naglik was the child's primary caregiver. Pople's counsel sought, and obtained, permission to comment on the failure of Naglik to testify. The trial judge allowed the comment, warning counsel that it had \"better be within the bounds of propriety\". In his address, Pople's counsel stated, in part: The evidence shows that it must have been at least one of them. Now, he has sworn before you that it wasn't him. Your eyes turn to the other and she does not get up and deny it. Her counsel makes an effort to put it on Peter Pople, to accuse him conjecturally, but she doesn't get up or explain anything or accuse anyone. In response, Naglik's counsel explaineds. 11(c)of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and pointed out that she had made exculpatory statements to various persons in authority at the first opportunity, unlike Pople. Naglik's counsel also moved for a mistrial because of the comment, but the motion was denied.

C-46(formerly s. 197), the appropri­ate test to be applied was an objective one, and that the jury should convict if they were of the view that the parent \"knew, or ought to have known, the seriousness of the child's con­dition and that it required medical attention\". With respect to the need for a unanimous verdict, the trial judge initially charged the jury as follows: In other words, each and all of you must agree on each verdict that you see fit to return with respect to each accused. It is your right to disagree but I know you will do your best to come to an agreement. This trial has involved considerable time and expense and there have been the lives of people, your lives, the lives of witnesses, have been disrupted and I am certain that no other jury can deal with this matter better than you. The jury retired at 3:08 p.m. They returned to ask a question at 3:35 p.m., which the trial judge answered, and then again at 4:35 p.m., when they asked \"Do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty?\" The trial judge answered this question as follows: Your question is \"do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty\". Well, the 12 of you have to agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty with respect to count one and with respect to each accused. In other words, you must be unanimous one way or the other with respect to each accused and with respect to each count. Is that confusing? In other words, you have to look at count one and you have to consider the evidence with respect to each accused and bring in your verdict one way or the other. The 12 of you have to come to a decision one way or the other. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts for both Naglik and Pople at 8:08 p.m., and was polled at the request of defence counsel.",

    "text": "On February 23, 1990, before a judge and jury, the respondent was found guilty of engaging in anal intercourse with his step-son and sentenced to four years imprisonment. J.E., the complainant, was 13 years of age at the time of the trial and kindergarten-aged at the time of the alleged incidents. If his story is true, he lived for a period of some months in a household marked by brutal physical and sexual abuse. The trial judge conducted an inquiry into J.E.'s understanding of the oath and was satisfied that he could be sworn to testify. J.E. was the only Crown witness on the material points. His sworn testimony was that, from the age of five, he was subjected to repeated and violent sexual acts by his step-father, the respondent. The respondent testified on his own behalf and denied the allegations. Additionally, J.E. testified that his mother forced him to perform oral sex with her, that his step-brother forced him to perform oral and anal sex with him and that his step-sister coerced him to participate in sexual acts with her. All of these individuals denied such incidents took place. The defence's theory of the case was that J.E. was actually the victim of abuse over this period at the hands of his natural father. J.E. testified that he was not abused by his natural father, whom he saw periodically during this time; his mother, however, testified that he looked nervous and shaken after these visits. The case boiled down to a question of credibility and the jury believed J.E. over the accused. The respondent's appeal to the Alberta Court of Appeal was argued on February 28, 1991. On June 21, 16 months after the trial, and while the judgment of the Court of Appeal was still reserved, the trial judge wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal containing the following comments: This accused's appeal from conviction, as I understand it, has been argued and is now reserved.

    "text": "The respondent, David Grant, was acquitted of charges of unlawful cultivation of marihuana and possession of marihuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to ss. 6(1) and 4(2)NCA. The acquittal resulted from the exclusion from evidence of a number of items seized during a search conducted under a warrant issued pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Code. The basis for exclusion was that statements made in the information sworn in order to ground the warrant request included information obtained during warrantless perimeter searches of the residence used by the respondent. The trial judge found these warrantless searches to be in violation ofs. 8of theCharter. In a routine roadblock check conducted on April 29, 1989, a truck driven by the respondent, who purported to reside in an apartment in Victoria, British Columbia, was found to contain a number of items consistent with a marihuana growing operation. On May 23, 1989, a police officer had received information from what he claimed to be a previously reliable but confidential informant that at the time of the roadblock, the respondent had been on his way to set up a marihuana growing operation and that he was part of an organization cultivating marihuana on south Vancouver Island. The police later conducted two warrantless perimeter searches of the residence used by the respondent, a two‐storey building at 11110 Trillium Place, Sidney, British Columbia. On September 7, 1989, two officers entered onto the property looking for signs of marihuana cultivation. During a search of the perimeter, they observed several things which would have been impossible to have observed without entering onto the property. They noted covered windows on the lower floor, heard what they described as the sound of electric motors or fans emanating from inside the residence and noticed two air vents which looked recently installed. Later that day, the police observed the respondent leave the Trillium Place residence and followed him to an apartment in Victoria. On September 20, 1989, the respondent was observed carrying what appeared to be fertilizer or weed sprayer from the Victoria apartment to the Trillium Place residence. On September 21, 1989, two police officers conducted a second perimeter search of the Trillium Place property and noted that the basement windows appeared to be sealed with plastic and were wet with condensation.",

Further, the police conducted inquiries of B.C. Hydro and were able to determine that recent electrical consumption at the Trillium Place property had been unusually high compared with other similar area residences. Based on an information that included the pieces of information gleaned in May, 1989, the inquiries made of B.C. Hydro, as well as the observations made during the two warrantless perimeter searches, on September 22, 1989 the R.C.M.P. obtained search warrants pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Code. These warrants authorized \"peace officers\" to search the Trillium Place address and the Victoria apartment. The respondent was arrested at his business, advised of his rights and given copies of the warrants. On execution of the warrants, the police discovered 80 plants which were later identified as marihuana, a variety of growing equipment at the Trillium Place address and a small amount of marihuana, drug‐related paraphernalia and documents at the Victoria apartment. The respondent was acquitted of the charges referred to above when the evidence obtained in the searches and seizures was excluded by reason of a violation ofs. 8of theCharter.",

The respondent was charged with 14 counts of sexual assault involving seven complainants who were his patients at all relevant times. The assaults were alleged to have occurred while the complainants attended at the respondent's office for medical treatment and diagnosis. Each of the complainants consented to being touched in intimate areas of her body but that consent was predicated upon the touching being carried out for valid medical purposes. Prior to trial, the respondent applied for an order that each of the counts alleged against him be tried separately. He requested in the alternative that the counts be severed by complainant. McDonald J., who was not the trial judge, heard the application. He did not order a separate trial for each count, but instead ordered that three different trials be held depending on the part of the complainant's body that was involved in the assault. McDonald J. ordered one trial for allegations involving the complainants' genitalia, a second trial for allegations concerning the complainants' breasts, and a third trial for any other matters. This resulted in an order that not only severed but also divided counts, such that separate trials were to be held for events that occurred within one visit to the respondent's office by the same complainant. The respondent elected to be tried by judge alone. The Crown proceeded to trial first on those counts relating to vaginal examinations (nine counts in total), and sought to have the admissibility of the evidence relating to the severed counts determined at avoir direat the outset of the trial. Hope J., the trial judge, refused to hold avoir direand ruled that the Crown could proceed by calling all of the evidence relating to the severed counts, subject to a subsequent ruling on admissibility. The Crown called all of the evidence relating to the severed counts, as well as the evidence of the complainants in the trial going to the counts before the court and the evidence of two medical experts.

The complainant, R.S., was born on March 12, 1979, and disclosed the sexual occurrences in March of 1988. In May 1988, following a medical examination of the complainant, the police began an investigation of the allegations. In August 1988, a videotape interview of the complainant took place. The complainant, a female child who was nine years old at the time of the videotaping, indicated that the respondent, her grandfather, had put his hand inside her \"privates\" and had touched her \"chest\". She further indicated that this had happened \"lots of times\". R.S. also mentioned that the respondent had warned her not to tell anybody or else he would hurt her. The respondent was charged in October 1988. At the preliminary inquiry, held in May and June 1989, the complainant testified before the court. At the trial, held in November and December 1989, the Crown sought to introduce the videotaped interview of the complainant, pursuant to the dispositions of 715.1 of theCriminal Code. The respondent moved for a declaration that s. 715.1 was unconstitutional as it contravened ss. 7 and 11(d) of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. The trial judge dismissed the motion, upholding the constitutionality of s. 715.1. Following avoir dire, at which the complainant, her mother and the sergeant involved in making the videotape testified, the videotaped interview was admitted into evidence.

E.T. was at the time a 16-year-old drop-out who lived with his great-aunt, C.T., a 62-year-old Elder of the Tsawout Band with two years of schooling. Three other persons, two young offenders, A. and L.I.R., and an adult of approximately 23 years, were also implicated in this murder. The adult, Michael Allen, was tried before a judge and jury and convicted of manslaughter. His trial and the appeals therefrom took place prior to commencement of the trial of the young offenders and Allen gave evidence for the Crown at the latter trial. The three young offenders were charged with first degree murder. The Crown's theory was that the death of the cab driver was the intended culmination of a plan to rob a taxi cab driver. The trial judge concluded on a no-evidence motion that with respect to all three accused there was no evidence of first degree murder. The Youth Court judge convicted the appellant and A. of murder in the second degree and L.I.R. of manslaughter. During the course of the trial, the Crown sought to have admitted as evidence two statements made by E.T. to the police after the killing. The trial judge excluded a first statement made the day of E.T.'s arrest, but admitted a second statement made the next day. The circumstances surrounding the making of the two statements were as follows. On the morning of October 12 (the murder of the cab driver having taken place in the very early hours of that morning), the appellant was arrested at his home, warned, and his clothes were seized. He asked that his great-aunt, C.T., whom he regarded as his mother, be allowed to come with him and the two were taken to the RCMP station. While en route to the station in the police car, C.T. began searching in her purse for her lawyer's card, and was advised by the police officers that \"all of that\" would be taken care of at the police station. When they arrived at the station, however, E.T. and his aunt were taken directly to an interview room, and Constable Logan commenced taking a statement from E.T. which lasted some four and a half hours.",

Following the appellant's request, he had an interview in person with his lawyer which lasted half an hour. The next morning, the appellant telephoned Constable Logan and said he remembered some things he had forgotten the day before and wished to add them to his statement. When the Constable arrived at the police station, he found the appellant engaged in a telephone conversation with his lawyer which ended shortly thereafter. When Logan sat down with the appellant, they again went through the filling out of the \"Statement to Person in Authority\" form and E.T. indicated without prompting that he did not wish to speak to anyone other than Constable Logan or have anyone else present during his statement. Constable Logan also explained to E.T. that if anyone had offered him any hope of advantage or suggested any fear of prejudice with respect to giving this statement, that E.T. should forget about what they had said. The second statement was taken over a relatively short period, and after covering the topics which E.T. had apparently mentioned over the phone, reverted to a discussion of what the youths' plan with respect to the cab driver had been. The second statement included the following exchange: Q. . . . What was the complete plan? A.[A.] was gonna sit behind the driver and stab him in the neck. . . . I was supposed to sit in the passenger side in the front and just stab when ah . . . [L.I.R.] and [Allen] were to hold the guns to his head.

    "text": "Before leaving this question, I should comment on two points. The first is the argument that the divergent stories of the complainant and the accused on consent, as a matter of law, necessarily preclude a third alternative, the defence of honest but mistaken belief. I am not so convinced as my colleagues that where the evidence consists of two diametrically opposed stories, one alleging lack of consent and the other consent, it is logically impossible to conceive of the defence of honest but mistaken belief arising. While it may rarely occur, it seems to me possible for a jury to accept parts of the testimonies of both the complainant and the accused, concluding that notwithstanding lack of actual consent, the accused honestly believed in consent. Bryant states: ...the removal of this alternative plea on the basis that the testimony of the complainant and the accused are diametrically opposed, and that there is a lack of common ground for the defence is based, in part, on the premise that the complainant's version is complete -- a questionable assumption in some cases. Moreover, a requirement for corroboration may wrongly encourage an accused to dovetail partially his testimony with that of the complainant in order to supply the necessary common ground for the defence.

She is the mother of Josée Desjardins, who, at the time of the alleged offence, was Serge Edsell's girlfriend. Edsell and Raymond were jointly involved in drug trafficking. Josée Desjardins and Serge Edsell met and began living together in March 1989. In early May, after being evicted from the apartment where they were living, they moved in temporarily with the respondent. In her testimony the respondent described the terrible existence caused by Edsell's presence in her house, the fact that he was engaged in drug trafficking there and the comings and goings of his customers in the house. She said that Edsell was always angry, that he threatened her frequently and that he beat his girlfriend Josée Desjardins. The respondent even tried to commit suicide. However, this version of the facts was contradicted by the testimony of Josée Desjardins at the preliminary inquiry. (Desjardins was killed before the trial and so could not testify at it.) She denied that she had ever been beaten by Edsell. In early July the respondent moved in order to put an end to Edsell's presence in her house. This was unsuccessful, as Edsell continued to go to the respondent's home to conduct his drug trafficking operations. On July 21, Edsell went to the respondent's home with a revolver, cocaine and scales. He asked her to hide the weapon. He forced her to weigh some cocaine and then suggested he would kill her, together with her daughter and granddaughter. Shortly afterwards Josée Desjardins arrived accompanied by Alain Raymond. At this point the respondent consumed a small amount of drugs and then went to get the weapon she had hidden in the bathroom. She fired at Edsell, who fell at once. Seeing that Raymond was lunging at her, she also fired at him. Edsell survived but Raymond died of his injuries. Josée Desjardins' version of the facts was slightly different. She said that the respondent fired on Edsell and then aimed at her own daughter. Raymond then tried to escape and that is when the respondent also shot him. In her statements to the police immediately after these events the respondent admitted firing at Edsell and Raymond and said she wished both of them dead.",

    "text": "2In the course of an investigation it undertook in 2001 in cooperation with a number of municipal police services, the Sûreté du Québec, Canadian and American customs officers and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified a cannabis trafficking ring. On July 3, 2002, 26 individuals, including the respondent, were charged. The respondent pleaded guilty before a judge of the Court of Québec on a count of conspiring to produce and traffic in cannabis, possess cannabis for the purpose of trafficking and possess property derived from trafficking in cannabis (s. 465Cr. C.), and on another count of committing indictable offences for the benefit of a criminal organization (s. 467.12Cr. C.). 3The prosecution suggested a sentence of imprisonment for six years less time served in pre‐trial detention, and a fine instead of an order of forfeiture (s. 462.37(3)Cr. C.). It submitted that the money could not be located because the respondent had disposed of it by making various gifts and purchases. Counsel for the respondent recommended a sentence of 40 months that, once the period of pre‐trial detention was taken into account, would have been reduced to eight and a half months' imprisonment, which could have been served in the community. On the question of the fine, counsel argued that the respondent had not benefited personally from the money, but rather had spent it on his friends and family. 4After sentencing submissions were made, the judge found that the respondent had personally participated in transporting the cannabis and that he was not just an underling. He had brought another individual into the ring, trained him, and received a share of the income that this individual made from the illegal activities. The respondent had received at least $150,000 from the crimes in question. The judge determined the appropriate sentence to be imprisonment for 50 months, which he reduced to 19 months to take the period of pre‐trial detention into account. Because of the nature of the charges, he denied the respondent's request to serve the sentence in the community. Regarding the request for a fine instead of a forfeiture order, the judge said that he was unable to find that the respondent was still in possession of the $150,000 he had received from the illegal activities.",

Stating that he was exercising his discretion and finding that the majority opinion in the case law required him to take the respondent's ability to pay into consideration, the judge concluded that a $20,000 fine was [translation] \"justified\" , at para. 56). 5The prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeal solely in respect of the amount of the fine imposed instead of a forfeiture order. It submitted that the judge did not have authority to reduce the amount of the fine. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal . It first observed that a forfeiture order under s. 462.37(1) is mandatory. However, it considered the imposition under s. 462.37(3) of a fine instead of a forfeiture order to be optional. In the Court of Appeal's view, while s. 734(2) does not obviate the general rule that an offender's ability to pay should be taken into consideration, that rule is simply not mandatory in the case of a fine instead of forfeiture. The court concluded that it would be unfair not to take ability to pay into account. 6The prosecution was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The respondent was not represented, and the Court appointed counsel to act asamicus curiae.",

    "text": "A scuffle occurred outside Rafferty's, a Scarborough bar, at approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 22, 1991. One of the participants, Theodore Heffern, tried to escape and was chased by a number of individuals, including the appellant. Heffern ran onto the poorly-lit porch of a neighbouring house. One member of the pursuing group, Edward Sweeney, followed him onto the porch and began punching and kicking him. The appellant joined the fracas, and admits to having punched Heffern several times. When it became apparent that Heffern had been stabbed in the back, the appellant, Sweeney and a number of witnesses fled the scene. The appellant admitted common assault but denied aggravated assault, and gave evidence that he saw a black man, whom he identified as Jason Semester, approach the porch with a knife, stab Heffern and flee. Heffern testified that he did not see who stabbed him and that he did not see anyone other than the appellant and Sweeney on or near the porch at the time of the attack. He noted, however, that he had blacked out for approximately 10 seconds during the incident. Semester denied stabbing Heffern. He testified that he saw three men, including the victim, on or near the porch during the assault, but that he did not see anyone being stabbed. He also said that there were a number of black men, in addition to himself, who witnessed the event. James Kelly, Todd Ford and Reginald Nash, who were among the witnesses to the assault on the porch, testified at trial in support of the appellant's version of the events. It was the Crown's theory that those witnesses, all of whom were friends of the appellant, fabricated their stories in order to place the blame for the stabbing on Semester. Kelly's evidence was that he saw Semester go up to the porch and stab Heffern. He also stated that he had spoken to Semester prior to the attack and that Semester appeared to be \"buzzed\" or \"high\" on drugs. Ford testified that a number of black men were present during the assault and that he saw an individual matching Semester's general description approach the porch, stick his hand through the porch railing, and then flee. Ford further testified that he noticed moments later that the same man was carrying a knife.",

Nash testified that while he did not see anyone run up to the porch or stab Heffern, he did see an individual matching Semester's description, and whom he identified at trial as being Semester, run away from the porch. He also claimed that there was only one black man among the crowd who witnessed the assault and that he heard a member of the crowd say that Heffern had been stabbed by a black man. Nash further testified that an hour after the assault had occurred, he met Semester who showed him a bloody knife and admitted to the stabbing. However, when arrested and charged with aggravated assault in connection with the incident, Nash did not reveal that information to the police. At trial, he explained his silence on the grounds that he did not want to get anyone involved with the police and that he was afraid that Semester or others would harm him if he implicated Semester in the stabbing. Another witness, Kerri-Ann Parsons, testified that the only people on or near the porch at the relevant time were the appellant, Sweeney and Heffern. Parsons also testified that while she saw the appellant hunched over the fallen Heffern, she could not see what he was doing with his arms because his back was to her. Parsons stated that she did not see anyone stab Heffern. A number of witnesses stated that the appellant had blood on his right hand after the incident. The appellant testified that he was holding Heffern, who was in a sitting position, around the head with his left arm while punching him with his right hand when Semester unexpectedly stabbed him in the back. That evidence was challenged by the Crown during cross-examination on the ground that it would not explain how the appellant got blood on his right hand. A half hour before the initial scuffle occurred outside Rafferty's, another stabbing occurred a short distance away in the parking lot of a Pizza Pizza restaurant. The victim, Cameron Day, along with Jim Kelly, the witness who testified on behalf of the appellant, were involved in a fight.",

Day did not get a good look at the person who stabbed him and gave a description of the assailant that was not entirely consistent with Semester's appearance. Day also testified that he did not see anyone wield a knife during the incident. William Cowan, a friend of Day's, testified that he saw a white man and a black man involved in an altercation with Day.

Semester testified that he and a number of other black men were present during the incident but denied ever carrying a knife or stabbing Day.

    "text": "The appellants were among some 80 individuals simultaneously arrested on January 22, 1985 after the culmination of a police investigation into the manufacture and distribution of illicit drugs by members of two motorcycle clubs. The Crown initially laid a single information against 61 individuals charging them with conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine, cocaine and LSD. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 2, 1985. However, in November 1985 the Honourable John Crosbie, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, preferred two indictments, replacing the original information and cancelling the preliminary hearing. One indictment was presented in the Supreme Court of Ontario and named 12 accused. The other indictment was presented in the District Court of Ontario and named 27 accused including the appellants. The appellants Farinacci and Lépine were jointly charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine between October 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985. The appellant Jeffreys was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine between June 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985. The trial in the Supreme Court of Ontario proceeded first. It began on June 2, 1986 before Bowlby J. Verdicts were rendered on February 27, 1987. The appellants and seven other accused were tried in the District Court of Ontario before Judge O'Connell and a jury. That trial began on May 11, 1987. Pre-trial motions were heard throughout May, June and September. Verdicts were rendered on June 11, 1988. The appellants Farinacci and Lépine were convicted of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine. The appellant Jeffreys was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. The evidence against the appellants consisted of testimony from informant witnesses, results of physical surveillance and recordings of telephone conversations. One of the pre-trial motions entertained by the trial judge was a \"Wilson\" motion in which the appellants challenged the validity of seven wiretap authorizations which permitted the police to intercept their telephone conversations. The impugned authorizations were granted by Judge Scott of the District Court of Ontario. Two other authorizations were granted by Trainor and Ewaschuk JJ., both of the Supreme Court of Ontario. Prior to theWilsonhearing, the trial judge ordered the packets containing the material filed in support of all the authorizations to be opened.

He explained that after editing the affidavits himself he would give a copy of the edited affidavits to the Crown to determine if further editing needed to be done. He would then give copies to counsel for the various accused and hear any \"suggestions\" they had about the affidavits. After the adjournment, the trial judge indicated that he had read each affidavit in light of the decision inParmar. He claimed to have edited the affidavits \"only insofar as they contain information from informants and others which is to be protected, and insofar as they contain summary or opinion\". He then proceeded to review the edited affidavits with the Crown, who suggested a few additional deletions. In a few instances the Crown indicated that material edited by the trial judge could be disclosed. These suggestions were adopted by the trial judge. The accused and their counsel were present throughout this exercise. The trial judge then proposed to distribute the edited affidavits to counsel. However, before this took place, counsel for the appellant Farinacci made a submission requesting \"all information contained in these affidavits, other than the specific name and identifying address, or the like of anybody who purports to be in the position of an informant or informer, as the case may be\". The Crown argued that this submission was premature. The trial judge agreed. At that point counsel for the appellant Jeffreys requested clarification of the procedure which the trial judge intended to follow. He specifically asked whether the appellants would \"have some input to request further information from the affidavits\". The trial judge made it clear that the next step in the process was that the defence would receive copies of the edited affidavits and then the actualWilsonhearing would proceed. Once the edited affidavits were distributed to counsel, but before reviewing them, counsel for the appellant Farinacci, relying heavily on the decision inParmar, re-asserted the right of the defence to the deleted information. Counsel for the appellant Jeffreys requested an indication of the basis upon which the deletions were made.",

Counsel pointed out that the deletions made by the trial judge went beyond those which were made from the same affidavits by Bowlby J. The trial judge characterized the deletions which had been made by Bowlby J. as \"irrelevant\" to what he was doing. Counsel for the appellant Farinacci then asked about a specific deletion from one of the affidavits, asking if it was appropriate to inquire into whether his client's name appeared in the deleted materials and in what context. The trial judge indicated that it was not appropriate for him to inquire, stating that the deletion was made \"in the interests of the persons involved\" and that all the deletions he made \"were strictly related to informants, and one or two other minor deletions which related to commentary...\". Counsel for the appellant Jeffreys stated that the defence were, at leastprima facie, entitled to all information reflecting on the reasonable and probable grounds upon which the authorizations were granted. The trial judge flatly rejected this submission. The Crown submitted that \"[t]he accused are entitled to know if they are named in the deleted portions.\" The trial judge then proceeded to list those accused named in the deleted portions of the nine affidavits. Defence counsel was also advised that no confidential sources had died, were potential Crown witnesses or were police officers. At theWilsonhearing, the appellants cross-examined the three police officers who swore affidavits in support of the nine authorizations. The trial judge ruled that defence counsel could not cross-examine the \"sub-affiants\" who supplied information to the affiants. However, he granted the appellants leave to call two additional police officers as witnesses. On June 24, 1987 the trial judge dismissed the application to set aside the seven District Court authorizations.

This motion was heard and dismissed by Watt J. on September 10, 1987:R. v. Durette(1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 590, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 126. No appeal was taken from this decision. The appellants appealed their convictions to the Court of Appealinter aliain respect of the validity of the wiretap authorizations and the admissibility and use of the recordings intercepted pursuant thereto. On May 15, 1992, the Court of Appeal, Doherty J.A. dissenting, dismissed the appeal:R. v. Durette (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 557, 54 O.A.C. 81, 72 C.C.C. (3d) 421. The appellants appeal to this Court as of right pursuant tos. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.",

The complainant was 16 years old at the time of the trial. She testified that the respondent had resided at her parents' home in the summer of 1982 for one or two months when she was eight years old and that, on one occasion, while her parents were away for a weekend with their van club, she was left alone in the care of the respondent. On both nights during the absence of her parents, the respondent sexually assaulted her while she was in bed. The complainant further testified that about one week before the \"van club weekend\", the respondent had sexually assaulted her while her mother was asleep. She described the last assault as having taken place a few months later, when the respondent was no longer staying at her parents' house and her aunt came to baby-sit. The complainant, who first spoke of these sexual assaults in 1989 when she was 15 years old, initially reported that the sexual assaults had occurred in 1980. An information was drafted and the respondent was arrested on August 11, 1989. After being cautioned and given his right to counsel, the respondent made several inculpatory statements to the arresting officers. At the time of his arrest, the respondent was informed by the police that the incidents of which he was being accused had occurred when he was living at the complainant's house. The information sworn on the day of the respondent's arrest described the period of the alleged assaults as being between January 1, 1980 and January 1, 1981. However, after the preliminary inquiry, the information was amended, on consent, to allege that the incidents had occurred between January 1, 1982 and January 1, 1983. At trial, the complainant testified that all the incidents had occurred in 1982, stating that she and her mother had gone through old photographs which had helped them determine the relevant time frame.",

The complainant's mother was also called by the Crown and she testified that the respondent had lived with the family for two months in the summer of 1982, and that the respondent had baby-sat her daughter during a van trip to Rochester, New York, in July of 1982. The Crown closed its case and the trial was adjourned to accommodate the defence, which had not received disclosure of oral inculpatory statements made by the respondent to the police. Prior to adjourning, defence counsel stated in open court that he would be calling three witnesses, including an alibi witness, and the Crown indicated the defence's undertaking to provide him with the particulars of the alibi evidence. When the trial resumed approximately five weeks later, the Crown applied to reopen its case and recall the complainant's mother with respect to new evidence pertaining to the dates of the offences. Over the defence's objection, he was permitted to do so. The mother testified that she had been mistaken as to the year in which the respondent stayed with the family, and that she now realized the proper time frame was the summer of 1983, not the summer of 1982. The alibi evidence was to have been that the respondent had been confined to a hospital during the relevant time period in the summer of 1982. The Crown then moved to have the indictment amended to extend the period during which the sexual assaults were alleged to have occurred to include the year 1983. Over the defence's objection, leave to amend was granted and the time frame described in the indictment became January 1, 1982 to January 1, 1984. After a further adjournment, the respondent was called and he testified that he had lived with the complainant's family during the summer of 1983. The respondent was found guilty of indecent assault and of having sexual intercourse with his niece when she was under the age of 14.

One of the passengers died following the accident and another two were injured, one of them seriously. The respondent was charged with one count of impaired driving causing death and two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm. The respondent's trial was held before Aylward J. of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Trial Division, and a jury. The evidence revealed that Constable Stanley, who arrived first at the scene of the accident cautioned the respondent, advised him of his rights unders. 10of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsand made a breathalyzer demand. Stanley had determined from other persons at the scene that the respondent was the person driving the vehicle and noted that he smelled of alcohol and was staggering. Stanley then took the respondent to the police station and delivered him into the control of Constable Tilley, who asked him if he understood his right to contact counsel and assisted the respondent in doing so. In fact, a telephone book was supplied and Tilley called several lawyers before finding one of them available. When the respondent's counsel was contacted, Tilley informed him that the officers had received word that one of the passengers had died. Tilley then turned the phone over to the respondent so that he could have a private discussion with his counsel. Prior to the respondent's conversation with his lawyer, he heard the officers say that one of the passengers had died and was told that two others were in serious condition. After consulting with legal counsel, the respondent refused to provide the police with a sample of his breath. However, once informed that a charge for failing to comply with a demand for a breath sample would be laid if he refused, the respondent complied. His counsel telephoned the station after the first sample was given and spoke with the respondent again. After this, a second sample was taken. Both samples contained 170 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.",

At trial, the respondent's counsel objected to the admission of the breath samples results on the ground that the police had acted in violation ofss. 10(a)and (b) of theCharter. Avoir direon the admissibility of the breath samples and statements made by the respondent at the police station was held and Aylward J. concluded that the evidence ought to be excluded unders. 24(2)of theCharterbecause the respondent had been denied his rights unders. 10of theCharter. Crown counsel requested a recess and, after 30 minutes, returned to tell the court that it did not plan to call further evidence. Given that, prior to thevoir dire, the Crown had called only one witness, a police officer who took photographs of the aftermath of the accident, the trial judge charged the jury to deliver a verdict of acquittal. On January 29, 1991, the respondent was acquitted. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland on the ground that the analysis of the breath samples should have been admitted into evidence. On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from acquittal. The majority of the Court concluded that the trial judge had erred in excluding evidence which was unarguably important, but that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the appeal had been unnecessary given that the Crown could have called further substantial evidence at trial, but chose not to. Goodridge C.J., dissenting, held that the provisions ofs. 686(4)of theCriminal Codewere mandatory and that s. 686(4) required the court to order a new trial if it determined that the appeal should be allowed.",

    "text": "The accused, Imre Finta, was born in Kolozsvar, Hungary (now a part of Romania) in 1912. During the 1930s, he lived and studied law in Szeged, Hungary. In 1935, Mr. Finta enrolled in the Royal Hungarian Military Academy and in January 1939 he was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Hungarian Gendarmerie. The Gendarmerie is most accurately described as an armed paramilitary police force which served the Hungarian government by wielding political muscle in the country's more rural areas. By 1942, Mr. Finta had achieved the rank of captain in this notorious organization. In March 1944, Mr. Finta was posted to Szeged as commander of the investigative subdivision of the Gendarmerie. That same month Hungary had been occupied by the forces of the Third Reich. Despite the fact that Hungary had joined the Axis powers in 1940, Germany proceeded to install an even more pro-German puppet government in the Hungarian capital of Budapest. Thus, throughout the relevant period, Hungary was ade factooccupied state. The Hungarian police and the Gendarmerie came under the direct command of the German SS, and these two organizations were instrumental in administering the anti-Jewish laws adopted by the Nazi government of Germany and the Hungarian government under its control. The charges against Mr. Finta stem from his time in Szeged. Mr. Finta is alleged to have been in charge of the \"de-jewification\" of Szeged during the spring of 1944. This activity was authorized by the so-called \"Baky Order\", the Hungarian Ministry of the Interior Order passed on April 7, 1944. In its essentials, the \"Baky Order\" called for the isolation, complete expropriation, ghettoization, concentration, entrainment, and eventual deportation (primarily to Auschwitz and Birkenau) of all Hungarian Jews. Once there, these Jews faced either immediate extermination or forced labour followed by eventual extermination. The events at Szeged were duplicated in villages and towns across Hungary throughout that unfortunate spring. There can be no doubt that this process, which my colleague, Justice Cory, has described in all its horrific detail, was an integral part of what the Nazis themselves dubbed the \"final solution\" to the \"Jewish problem\", namely the systematic slaughter of every last European Jew.",

In 1951, Finta immigrated to Canada. In 1956 he became a Canadian citizen, and has lived in this country ever since. Mr. Finta was charged with unlawful confinement, robbery, kidnapping and manslaughter of 8,617 Jews between May 16 and June 30, 1944 at or about Szeged, Hungary, thereby committing an offence under the definitions of these crimes in theCriminal Codeexisting at the time the offences were committed. The indictment added that such offences constituted crimes against humanity and war crimes under what is nows. 7(3.71)of theCriminal Code. The latter reference was added because prosecution for crimes committed abroad cannot ordinarily take place in Canada since criminal offences are generally confined to conduct that takes place in Canada (s. 6 of theCode), and the conduct alleged here took place in Hungary. Section 7(3.71), however, permits prosecution for conduct outside Canada if such conduct constitutes a crime against humanity or a war crime and would have been a crime in Canada at the time it took place had it been committed here. As Cory J. states, the principal issue in this case concerns a proper understanding of this and related provisions permitting persons to be prosecuted in Canada for crimes against Canadian law if these crimes also constitute crimes against humanity or war crimes under international law. My colleague has set forth the judicial history of the case and I need not repeat it except as may be necessary in setting forth my views. For the moment, it suffices to set forth the basic procedural steps in the proceedings. Following a pre-trial motion before the late Callaghan A.C.J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, to consider a number of constitutional issues regarding the validity of the legislation under theCharter, a trial was held before Campbell J. sitting with a jury. The accused was acquitted and the acquittal was affirmed by a majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Dubin C.J. and the late Tarnopolsky J.A. dissenting. From that decision, the Crown appealed to this Court, raising seven grounds of appeal.",

When the police sought to arrest Jones for these incidents, he confronted them with a loaded shotgun for which he was convicted of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. Jones was sentenced to five years in prison for these incidents. On November 25, 1985, Jones was released under parole. On October 24, 1986, Jones sexually assaulted a 26-year-old woman, having forced her into his car and confined her there. Jones was alleged to have committed a sexual assault against a 14-year-old girl on October 26, 1986. On November 5, one day after being questioned for the earlier sexual assaults, Jones sexually assaulted a nine-year-old girl at knife point. On November 7, Jones was charged with three counts of sexual assault with a weapon (contrary to s. 246.2 of theCriminal Code) and three counts of unlawful confinement (contrary to s. 247(2) of theCode). On November 18, 1986, the appellant's lawyer requested that he be remanded for observation to determine if he was mentally ill. In particular, the appellant's counsel requested the order to determine whether the appellant was fit to stand trial, was sane at the time of the alleged offences and to gain some insight into the appellant for the purpose of sentencing. He was so remanded pursuant to s. 465(1)(c)(iii) of theCode. A 30-day remand order was issued \"for purposes of medical and/or psychiatric observation\". Two psychiatrists and one psychologist examined the appellant at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute. Prior to the first examination, Dr. Lohrasbe warned the appellant that none of the discussions would be confidential and that all information that was provided could be used against the appellant in the course of the proceedings. A second psychiatrist, Dr. Semrau, also examined the appellant and warned him that the interview was not confidential and could be used against him in court. He also advised the appellant of his right to talk to counsel.

The psychologist, Dr. La Torre, warned the appellant prior to his interview with him that anything he said could be used in a court of law. Although the trial judge found that the appellant was adequately warned that his discussions with the psychiatrists could be used against him, he was not specifically warned that the evidence of the psychiatrists could be used to assist in determining whether or not he was a dangerous offender. In the course of assessing the appellant's mental health, Dr. Lohrasbe became concerned about the appellant's potential for future violence. These concerns emerged from Mr. Jones himself who stated during the examination that he was a danger to potential victims. Although Dr. Lohrasbe considered the implications of the use of this evidence at the dangerous offender stage, he did not fundamentally alter his method of interviewing. While he administered a slightly different intelligence test (using a more widely accepted version), the focus of the testing was identical to the one to determine the state of Jones' mental health. The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual assault with a weapon. During the dangerous offender proceedings that followed, the trial judge conducted avoir direin which the appellant challenged the admissibility of the evidence from the three doctors at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute on the grounds that to admit this evidence would breach hiss. 7Charterrights. The trial judge found that the evidence was admissible in spite of the fact that additional warnings had not been given to the appellant about the possible use of this psychiatric testimony in dangerous offender proceedings. Dr. Lohrasbe found that the appellant was extremely dangerous and he could see no basis for a change in this psychological make-up in the foreseeable future. He concluded that placing the appellant in the community would put other young women at risk. Dr. La Torre found that the appellant had considerable hostility toward women and that his lack of insight into his problem created a strong risk that he would re-offend. Dr. Semrau found that the appellant's sexual assault tendency followed a very dangerous pattern that was highly likely to repeat itself in the future.",

The appellant's trial from March 30 to April 2, 1992 was held before Morin J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, and a jury. The only evidence at the trial was the complainant's, who testified at trial that at the time of the alleged assaults she lived with her family next door to the appellant. Her family did not have a telephone. They had the appellant's permission to use his. She testified that, in approximately 1981, when she was 13 years old, she was sent to make a telephone call at the appellant's home, and while she was there he raped her. She said that she froze, was frightened, and said nothing to her parents. During the year that her family lived next door to the appellant, the complainant initially testified that she was regularly sent to the appellant's home to make telephone calls, and that he raped her on 10 to 20 such occasions. The complainant testified during examination in chief that she did not report the assaults until 1990 because she was afraid of what the appellant might do to her. During the complainant's cross-examination, it was disclosed that in her initial statement to the police in January of 1990, she stated that the appellant had raped her three times. At the preliminary hearing, she stated that he raped her five or six times. At the trial, in 1992 she said he had raped her 10 to 20 times. The complainant explained this by saying that it was \"hard to put a number [on] exactly how many times these things happen to you\". The complainant was cross-examined with respect to an affidavit sworn by her in 1989 and filed in wardship proceedings concerning her son, in which she swore that she had never been sexually abused.

Once confronted with these, the affidavit and the sworn statement in cross-examination, the complainant stated that she believed the statements were true at the time she made them, because she had blocked out the incidents involving the appellant until her memory returned in a flashback in 1990. This evidence in cross-examination was in direct contradiction to her testimony in chief that she did not complain until 1990 because of her fear of the appellant. The complainant testified that this flashback in 1990 occurred during a period when she was being interviewed by police and children's aid workers in connection with further wardship proceedings over her son and following suggestions allegedly by the police that if she thought about what the police told her she might have a flashback and in her mind remember. This suggestion occurred at a time when the complainant was seeking custody of her son and felt she needed the co-operation of the police who she had admitted saying were hounding her. The appellant did not testify in his defence. The jury after deliberating for two hours returned to ask for clarification as to the appellant's right to take the stand in his own defence. The trial judge answered, saying that the appellant was entitled to give evidence or call evidence on his behalf, but that there was no onus on him to prove his innocence. The jury returned 10 minutes later with a verdict of guilty. The appellant appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the principal ground of appeal being that the verdict was unreasonable.

    "text": "On Sunday, April 14, 1991, the respondent, 43 years old, was hitting golf balls in the soccer field of a school yard in Ottawa. Eight‐year‐old Tyler Arnold and his friends Joey, Andy and Shawn, entered the school yard, which was about one block away from Tyler Arnold's home, in order to play. They asked the respondent whether they could catch the balls with their gloves. The boys had first met the respondent in that same field the previous summer, but only knew him by his first name, John, which was on his key chain. The boys caught the balls for some time and then some of them went to get refreshments. Tyler remained in the school yard where the respondent began photographing him. When two of the other boys, Andy and Joey, returned to the school yard, they had trouble locating the respondent and Tyler. They found the respondent taking pictures of Tyler in a wooded area at the edge of the school yard. When the other two boys began to interfere with the picture taking, the respondent asked them several times to leave him and Tyler alone. Ultimately, the respondent and Tyler ran back out of the wooded area, away from the two other boys. When Andy and Joey caught up, the respondent said \"Guys, leave us alone\". Andy agreed to leave them alone if he could steer the respondent's car around the parking lot. The respondent agreed. Tyler and Joey sat in the front seat, and, while the respondent operated the gas and break, Andy, sitting on his lap, steered the car. Soon thereafter the children got out of the car and the respondent told Tyler that they could go to the Champlain Bridge. One of the children overheard part of this conversation and asked the respondent where he and Tyler were going. The respondent did not answer. Although the two children told Tyler not to go with the respondent, Tyler re-entered the car. The respondent and Tyler drove approximately 2.9 km, stopping at certain points to take pictures along the Ottawa River. They first drove to the Champlain Bridge where the respondent took photographs of Tyler.",

They first drove to the Champlain Bridge where the respondent took photographs of Tyler. Then, they drove to Kitchissippi Lookout at Westboro Beach where the respondent took more photographs of Tyler positioned on a large rock which juts out into the water of the Ottawa River, including some which feature Tyler on the rock's ledge. Upon returning home, the other two boys told Joey's mother that Tyler had left in a red car with the respondent, whose name they knew was John and who they had been told lived in an apartment building near the school yard. As a result, Joey's mother contacted Tyler's father, who, along with the boys, and others (including a police officer) began a search for Tyler which appears to have lasted somewhere between 30 and 90 minutes. Tyler's father and one of the other boys found Tyler and the respondent at the Kitchissippi Lookout at Westboro Beach where the respondent was taking pictures of Tyler wearing the respondent's sweater. Apparently, Tyler had been cold and the respondent had removed his sweater and offered it to Tyler. Tyler's father demanded to know on what authority the respondent had taken his son, and the respondent replied that he had intended to take pictures of Tyler as a surprise for Tyler's parents. As a consequence of these events, the respondent was charged with abduction of a person under fourteen years of age (s. 281of theCriminal Code), assault (s. 266 of theCode) and exposing a child to endangerment (s. 218 of theCode). On August 27, 1991, the respondent entered a plea of not guilty. On the same day, following the testimony of Tyler, the Crown withdrew the assault charge. At the close of the Crown's case, counsel for the defence moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the remaining two counts and the court so ordered. The Crown subsequently appealed the respondent's acquittals and the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal. The appellant sought and was granted leave to this Court only with regard to the charge under s. 281 of theCode.",

    "text": "On December 22, 1989 Durham Regional Police Forces (\"DRPF\") investigated the death of Frank Dowson. Police described the incident as accidental, but suspicious. However, after inspecting the scene and interviewing the appellant and another person who resided in the same home as the deceased, the investigation was discontinued and no charges were laid. On February 6, 1990, at approximately 5:20 p.m., Constable Trimm of the DRPF noted that the appellant had startled two passers-by while he was panhandling on a street in Oshawa. Trimm stopped his vehicle and questioned the appellant who identified himself as Doug Whittle. The officer then conducted a computer check through the Canadian Police Information Centre and discovered three outstanding committal warrants against the appellant which related to unpaid fines for provincial offence convictions. Trimm suspected from the appellant's conduct that he was schizophrenic and the appellant confirmed this when questioned about it. Trimm cautioned the appellant as to his rights and arrested him on the basis of the outstanding warrants. The appellant did not exercise his right to consult counsel. The appellant was then taken by Trimm to a DRPF station where he was placed in a cell. Constable Trimm told the cell officer that the appellant was mentally unstable and noted \"very mentally unstable\" on the arrest report. Since the outstanding warrants emanated from the Metro Toronto jurisdiction, the appellant was transported to Metro Police Station, 42 Division at around 6 p.m. Before being placed in a cell at that location, the appellant again declined to make any phone calls. Over the course of the next two hours, the appellant made several statements to the station operator and to the staff sergeant at 42 Division. The first statements indicated that the appellant had been involved in some heavy matters about which he wished to clear the slate. In later conversations with these officers, the statements became more specific, with the appellant indicating that he had been involved in a number of robberies in Windsor. At the point when the statements became more specific, two Metro police detectives were asked by the station operator to speak with the appellant. Detective Constable Orban spoke with the appellant in his cell.",

Detective Constable Orban spoke with the appellant in his cell. During the course of this conversation, the appellant indicated that he had killed Frank Dowson just before Christmas in 1989 by hitting him on the back of the head with an axe. In addition, the appellant stated that he had been involved in three robberies in Windsor approximately five years earlier. Orban testified that he had dealt with the appellant on prior occasions when the appellant had been ejected from donut shops and found sleeping in abandoned cars. Orban characterized the appellant as a \"loon\", a person whose actions were abnormal, based on the appearance, dress, conduct and manner of speaking of the appellant on prior occasions. Relying on this impression of the appellant, Orban asked his partner that evening, Detective Constable Gillespie, to speak with the appellant, referring to him as \"the loon\" in the cells. On speaking with Gillespie, the appellant repeated the same facts which he had relayed to Orban. Orban and Gillespie then left the cells in order to attempt to verify the occurrences. At approximately 8:20 p.m. Orban spoke with someone from the DRPF who indicated that a Frank Dowson had died under suspicious circumstances in Whitby just prior to Christmas. With this confirmation in hand, Orban and Gillespie proceeded to the cells, cautioned the appellant as to his right to counsel and to remain silent, and arrested him for the murder of Frank Dowson. The appellant indicated that he understood his rights, but that he did not wish to contact a lawyer. After Gillespie confirmed the Windsor occurrences, at about 9:10 p.m., he arrested the appellant in relation to those robberies. Again, the appellant was cautioned as to his rights, but he indicated that he did not wish to speak with anyone other than the officers. Gillespie then questioned the appellant in relation to the axe which he had mentioned in his earlier statement. The appellant told the officers that he had sawed the axe in half and thrown it in a field near Brock St. and Highway 401.",

The appellant then accompanied Orban and Gillespie to the location which he described where they met with two other officers from DRPF. During the 15-minute car trip to that location, the appellant \"talked continuously\" about the Windsor offences and the occurrence in Whitby. Although the search was unsuccessful at that point, the axe handle was located during a subsequent search of that area. On the return trip from the area, the appellant continued to disclose details relating to the murder, including the fact that he had disposed of his shoes after the incident and took precautions to avoid leaving fingerprints at the scene. Interspersed with this running discussion by the appellant were a series of two or three incidents in which the appellant stopped talking and made reference to someone being in his brain or having fog in his head. After this, he would continue talking about the incidents in question, as if these digressions had never occurred. Detective Constable Orban testified that it was more what the appellant said than how he said it which indicated to him that certain of the appellant's statements were divorced from reality. During the return trip from the 401 location, Gillespie suggested that the appellant make a video statement and the appellant indicated that he liked that idea. They proceeded to 4 District Headquarters where videotape facilities were available and Gillespie again advised the appellant of his rights under theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Once again, the appellant indicated that he did not wish to speak with a lawyer. Taping of the first video commenced at 11:40 p.m. on February 6, 1990. At the outset, the appellant confirmed that he had made statements relating to the commission of serious criminal offences earlier in the evening. Gillespie then questioned the appellant as to whether he wished to consult counsel and, after some discussion, the appellant indicated that he did wish to consult counsel. Following on this request, Gillespie contacted a defence attorney, Robert Nuttall, on behalf of the appellant. Gillespie spoke first with Nuttall and told him that the appellant had confessed to several serious crimes.",

Gillespie spoke first with Nuttall and told him that the appellant had confessed to several serious crimes. Nuttall agreed to speak with the appellant and testified that he had advised the appellant to \"keep his mouth shut\". He also testified that the appellant had told him that he had voices in his head, that he had to talk, that he had a pain in his head and that he could see dead babies' faces in cement. The appellant told Nuttall that he needed to talk to the police in order to stop the voices. After speaking with the appellant, Nuttall was convinced that the appellant would speak with authorities against his advice. When the appellant turned the phone over to Gillespie, Nuttall indicated that he agreed with Gillespie's characterization of the appellant as a \"loon\" or a \"nutbar\" and that he was sure that the appellant would speak with the authorities, in spite of Nuttall's advice to the contrary. Nuttall also told Gillespie that any other officers who wished to speak with the appellant should contact Nuttall before doing so. As predicted by Nuttall, the appellant indicated that he still wished to continue with the video statement. In the result, a second video statement was initiated at 12:21 a.m. on February 7, 1990. This statement lasted approximately one hour. At the outset, the appellant stated that he had not committed the offences described in the committal warrants and alleged \"somebody has used my name\". He described his reason for coming to the police as the result of \"crackin' in [his] mind\" and his resulting inability to live in society any longer. When reminded of the exercise of his right to counsel, the appellant acknowledged that he was informed that he had the right not to speak with the police, but that he wanted to talk to them anyway. Further, he indicated that he understood that it would be up to a judge whether or not his statements would be used in making a decision about him. After some prompting by Gillespie, the appellant repeated the details relating to the death of Frank Dowson which he had relayed earlier.",

So they're always tryin' a' think out a' me ... And every time I say somethin', unless I been asked a question, I can't think above them . . . we're both bein' punished\", and \"I managed to, ah, come up with this idea to walk backwards to New Brunswick . . . That would exercise me back to normal\". When asked whether he had been forced to say anything, the appellant indicated that he was uncertain whether he had been manipulated into it in that \"somebody maybe plotted murder in this life and they picked me to do it for them, right?\". The appellant also stated that he had always wanted to die, but that he had never been able to and that he intended to stay on his tippy-toes regardless of whether anyone liked it. After the video statement was taken the appellant volunteered to take Detective Constables Orban and Gillespie to the place where he claimed to have disposed of the wallet of Frank Dowson. Although the wallet was not located on the trip to the ravine that night, it was located by Orban and Gillespie in that area some time over the next two days. When found the wallet contained $800 in cash and at least one credit card bearing the name Frank Dowson. Orban and Gillespie transported the appellant back to 42 Division, Metro Toronto Police Force. At about 4:10 p.m., Detective Constables Carroll and Chambers of the DRPF spoke with the appellant in an interview room at 42 Division. The appellant was arrested for the first degree murder of Frank Dowson and cautioned as to hisCharterrights, which the appellant indicated that he understood. The appellant did not exercise his right to counsel.

During the drive back to 17 Division, the appellant responded to questioning by Chambers, providing the details of the death of Frank Dowson, including what Dowson was wearing, the amount of cash in his wallet and the fact that the appellant had hit him in the head with the blunt side of an axe. The appellant also indicated that after he hit Dowson, he went to a friend's house to purchase drugs. The appellant's lawyer, Robert Nuttall, testified that he saw the appellant on or about February 8 and 16, 1990. At this point, the behaviour of the appellant was judged by Nuttall to be quite bizarre. As a result, Nuttall consented to the appellant being remanded to the Metropolitan Toronto Forensic Service (\"METFORS\") facility for psychiatric examination in order to determine whether he was fit to stand trial. The next contact which Chambers and Carroll had with the appellant was on March 16, 1990 when the appellant was being returned from a 30-day psychiatric assessment. Chambers and Carroll met the appellant on the back stairs of the court house and followed him to the cell block there. The appellant indicated that he wanted to speak to them even though his lawyer had advised him not to. The appellant then stated that there had been no blood around Dowson's mouth after he had hit him, but that when he returned to the scene, Dowson was laying on the floor with blood around his mouth. He also indicated the name and address of the person from whom he claimed to have purchased drugs after the incident in question. Prior to trial, the appellant underwent psychiatric examination the results of which supported his fitness to stand trial. Apparently for this reason no issue was raised by either the prosecution, the defence or the court as to the appellant's fitness to stand trial. At the commencement of the trial, Crown counsel proposed to introduce into evidence all of the statements made by the appellant to various police officers.",

In order to deal with the admissibility of this evidence avoir direwas held, during which a number of expert witnesses were called. Perhaps the most central testimony came from Dr. Malcolm, who testified for the defence, and Dr. McDonald, who testified for the Crown. Dr. McDonald is a forensic psychiatrist with METFORS who examined the appellant during his 30-day psychiatric assessment in February and March 1990. Dr. Malcolm is also a forensic psychiatrist. Both gave the opinion that the appellant suffers from schizophrenia and that a common symptom of this illness is auditory hallucination. However, Dr. Malcolm testified that the appellant's condition would have been florid at the time of the video statement and that although the appellant may have been rationally aware of the consequences of giving the statement, he was driven to make the statements by the voices in his head. In contrast, Dr. McDonald testified that it was possible that the appellant had been experiencing auditory hallucinations at the time of the video statement, but that there was no specific evidence of that in the tape itself. Ruling on thevoir dire, the trial judge concluded that the exculpatory statement made by the appellant on December 22, 1989 was admissible, but that the inculpatory statements made on February 6, 7 and March 16, 1990 were inadmissible. Crown counsel then advised that no further evidence would be called on behalf of the Crown. The trial judge then instructed the jury to deliver a verdict of acquittal and a \"not guilty\" verdict was returned. The respondent Crown successfully appealed the acquittal of the appellant. The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial which would include all of the statements made by the appellant.",

Result If the Mental Element Relates Solely to the Actus Reus Which Requires That the Prohibited Act Be Performed Voluntarily Should it be thought that the mental element involved relates to theactus reusrather than themens reathen the result must be the same. Theactus reusrequires that the prohibited criminal act be performed voluntarily as a willed act. A person in a state of automatism cannot perform a voluntary willed act since the automatism has deprived the person of the ability to carry out such an act. It follows that someone in an extreme state of intoxication akin to automatism must also be deprived of that ability. Thus a fundamental aspect of theactus reusof the criminal act is absent. It would equally infringes. 7of theCharterif an accused who was not acting voluntarily could be convicted of a criminal offence. Here again the voluntary act of becoming intoxicated cannot be substituted for the voluntary action involved in sexual assault. To do so would violate the principle set out inVaillancourt,supra. Once again to convict in the face of such a fundamental denial of natural justice could not be justified unders. 1of theCharter. Summary of Proposed Remedy In my view, theChartercould be complied with, in crimes requiring only a general intent, if the accused were permitted to establish that, at the time of the offence, he was in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism or insanity. Just as in a situation where it is sought to establish a state of insanity, the accused must bear the burden of establishing, on the balance of probabilities, that he was in that extreme state of intoxication. This will undoubtedly require the testimony of an expert. Obviously, it will be a rare situation where an accused is able to establish such an extreme degree of intoxication. Yet, permitting such a procedure would mean that a defence would remain open that, due to the extreme degree of intoxication, the minimal mental element required by a general intent offence had not been established.",

(2d) 267, and by this Court, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956. Since the earlier judgment of this Court sets out the facts in detail, I will only give a brief description of the murder. On the night of September 18 to 19, 1976 the appellant met the victim, Mary Frances McKenna, in a bar in Toronto. Apparently the pair left the bar about midnight on their way to the victim's apartment. The attack which followed was one of unspeakable brutality. The appellant stabbed the victim 132 times using five different knives. The force used was such that some of the knives were broken at the time the police located them. In the course of the first two years of his sentence the appellant committed various disciplinary offences connected with smuggling and an attempted escape. Apparently when he was placed in punitive segregation for the latter offence he underwent a complete change of heart and became a \"model prisoner\". In 1983 he was transferred to a medium security institution and then in 1990 to a minimum security institution. During his confinement in these various penal institutions the appellant became involved in various charitable or religious groups. He participated in work programs in the institutions. Since 1988 he has received several permits for escorted temporary absences. At various times he took part in Alcoholics Anonymous activities. He also participated in some training sessions and requested the assistance of a psychologist.",

The following summary of the facts is based on the testimony of the witnesses. No findings of fact were made at trial as the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal. 3.On the evening of April 20, 1980 a public transit inspector observed two youths opening the driver's side of a parked truck and then trying to open car doors in a parking lot at the back of a shopping centre. He called the police on his radio. When the police arrived he gave them descriptions of the youths and advised them that he had seen the youths enter an apartment building. One of the police officers, Constable Handy, went to the front of the apartment building. 4.Constable Handy testified that as he approached the front door of the apartment building, he looked through the window of the basement apartment and saw two male persons who matched the description given to him by the transit inspector. He entered the building and walked down the stairs to the basement apartment. According to his testimony, the door to the apartment was open. The testimony of Landry and MacLaren (the second youth) differs from that of Constable Handy on this point. Landry testified that the door was closed and the officer knocked on it. Similarly, MacLaren testified that the officer knocked on the door and the door was answered by Landry. It is clear from the testimony of all three parties that Constable Handy stood in the doorway of the apartment and asked Landry if he lived there. Constable Handy testified that Landry replied in an offensive manner. 5.Constable Handy was in uniform at the time. He testified that he told the two youths they were under arrest for investigation of attempted auto theft. MacLaren testified that, initially, Constable Handy said only \"you are under arrest\" and did not state why until asked by MacLaren. Landry then indicated he did not want to go to the police station and both youths stated they had not done anything. Constable Handy walked into the room and stood quite close to them. When MacLaren took some steps toward the open door, Constable Handy took physical control of him by holding the sleeve of his jacket.",

The first count was framed as loitering \"at or near a playground\". The second count, which referred to the same events, was framed as loitering \"in or near a public park\". In 1987 the respondent was convicted of two counts of sexual assault contrary to the former s. 246.1(1) (now s. 271(1)) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. These convictions made him subject to the prohibition set out in s. 179(1)(b). On June 16, 1989, for about two minutes, Police Constable Ronald German observed the respondent standing in Beacon Hill Park in Victoria, British Columbia at the edge of a playground area. Around his neck the respondent was carrying a camera with a telephoto lens. The constable did not see the respondent take any pictures or approach or speak to any children. The respondent then went to another area of the park. Constable German followed the respondent and called to him. The respondent stopped, and German identified himself and produced his badge. He asked the respondent what he was doing in the park. The respondent replied that he was walking through the park just as he did every day. After some further discussion, the officer asked the respondent for his address, date of birth, and if he had a criminal record. The respondent replied that he had a criminal record for sexual assault. Constable German then told the respondent that his hanging around the park was contrary to the vagrancy section of theCode, and that a convicted sex offender was not permitted to loiter near a public park, school yard or playground. The respondent asked the officer what he meant by \"loitering\", to which Constable German very astutely replied: \"loitering meant standing around, apparently doing nothing, standing stationary in a location, or moving slowly in a certain area, stopping at regular intervals and standing around, or else loitering also could mean stopping in a location where it would obstruct persons who use that area too [sic] frequent\". The officer did not charge the respondent, but warned him not to loiter near the playground at the park again.",

On the afternoon of July 5, 1989, Constable Wayne Coleman observed the respondent walking on a pathway leading from the children's playground area in the Beacon Hill Park towards the petting zoo. After stopping there for a few minutes, the respondent went to his car. The respondent was once again carrying a camera with a large lens. Constable Coleman, who was in plain-clothes, followed the respondent in an unmarked police car. After driving around for approximately half an hour, the respondent returned to the park. There, the officer saw the respondent seated at a table approximately 50 yards from the playground area. He then moved to a bench approximately 20 yards from the playground and appeared to be using his camera. Some five minutes later, the respondent left the park and returned to his car. Constable Coleman followed the respondent to his residence, where he arrested Heywood and charged him with vagrancy. The police seized his camera and film. A search warrant was subsequently executed at his residence. A picture on the film found in the camera, and a number of pictures found in the respondent's residence and at the drugstore where he had his photographs developed, showed young girls playing in the park, their clothing disarranged from play so that the area of their crotch, although covered by underclothes, was visible. At his trial, the respondent pleaded not guilty and challenged the constitutionality of s. 179(1)(b) on the grounds that it infringedss. 7,11(d), (h),12and15of theCharter. The trial judge found that s. 179(1)(b) violatedss. 7and11(d)of theCharter, but that it was a justifiable limit under s. 1. The respondent was convicted of the first count of vagrancy under s. 179(1)(b). The second count was conditionally stayed pursuant to the principle expressed inKienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The respondent was sentenced to three months incarceration to be followed by three years probation. The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which dismissed his appeal.

On her way, she met the appellant, his brother Ryan Pittiman, and their friends, Beswick Goffe and Maheshwar Inderjeet. The four men invited her into the basement of the Pittiman house. She went willingly. She sat in the basement on a couch with the appellant and Ryan on either side of her. Goffe was behind her, and Inderjeet sat on another couch watching television. Goffe began \"making squiggles\" on her back. The complainant said that this did not bother her. Ryan asked her to go into the bathroom with him, and do \"a favour for a favour\", which she knew meant mutual oral sex. She refused and said that she had to leave, but they kept asking her to stay for another \"five minutes\", and pushed her on her shoulders whenever she tried to stand up. She could not remember who was pushing her. The appellant asked the complainant if she was ticklish and began to tickle her. He then began touching her legs and her thighs and attempting to undo her belt. She kept pushing his hand away. The appellant eventually succeeded in removing her belt and put his hands into her pants, inserting his fingers inside her vagina. The appellant was the only accused who the complainant specifically identified as having sexually assaulted her in the living room although she testified at times that \"they\" were touching her. 3Eventually, the appellant and Ryan led the complainant into a bedroom, pushed her on the bed and took her clothes off. The appellant had forcible intercourse with her while Ryan held her wrists. Ryan tried to put his penis in her mouth, but she turned her head away and pressed it into a pillow. The appellant finished and left the room. Ryan then did something to her but her mind has since blanked out whatever it was. Then Goffe came in, lifted her up and had forcible intercourse with her causing her a great deal of pain. The complainant was unclear in her testimony on Inderjeet's participation in the events of the evening. When it was over, they gave her clothes back and she got dressed.",

The complainant was taken to the hospital. The appellant's saliva was found mixed with her saliva on the inside of her bra. The four men were arrested and charged. Inderjeet, in the first three statements he gave to the police, denied being at the scene. Later, Inderjeet gave a statement admitting his presence and supporting the complainant's version of events. After Inderjeet admitted his presence, the appellant accused Inderjeet of \"ratting him out\". The confrontation was witnessed by two of Inderjeet's friends who provided statements and testified at trial. Inderjeet's charge was withdrawn after he testified against the other three at the preliminary hearing. Inderjeet also testified for the Crown at trial. The three accused did not testify. 5It was emphasized during the cross-examination of the complainant that, although she told the police about the appellant's conduct in detail in her initial statement, she did not mention Ryan's attempted fellatio. The first mention of it was at the preliminary inquiry. In addition, although the complainant recalled the appellant finishing the assault and leaving the room, she was uncertain what Ryan did after the appellant left and testified that her mind was \"blank\" when she tried to think about it. She said that she clearly remembered Goffe's assault on her because it had caused her the most pain. However, as with Ryan's attempted fellatio, she had made no mention of Goffe having penetrated her in her initial statement to the police.",

The victim, Gerald Smith, was taking out his garbage one evening when the appellant drove by in his police cruiser and asked Smith for identification. Smith refused, stating that he lived there. The appellant got out of the car and attempted to arrest the victim and a struggle ensued. 3At trial, there was an issue as to whether or not the assault was racially motivated. In a decision released on March 23, 1992, Haines J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, found that the appellant had used excessive force in making a lawful arrest but that the offence was not racially motivated. The trial judge found the appellant guilty of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(1)(b) of theCode. On April 3, 1992, he granted the appellant a conditional discharge with probation for 18 months. 4In sentencing the appellant, Haines J. concluded that he was compelled by the mandatory wording of s. 100 of theCodeto make an order prohibiting the possession of a firearm. Haines J. stated that it was \"truly unfortunate\" that he had to impose a prohibition order, as this could defeat the rehabilitative purpose of the conditional discharge in that the appellant being a police officer could not continue that employment unless he was able to possess a firearm. Haines J. imposed the prohibition for the minimum period of 5 years. 5The appellant appealed from both the conviction and the firearms prohibition. The respondent appealed the granting of the conditional discharge. The appeals were heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal on December 22, 1993. 6Prior to the hearing of the appeal, on August 1, 1992, an amendment to s. 100 of theCodewas proclaimed. The amendment had been passed by Parliament before sentencing in this case but had not been proclaimed. The new s. 100 removed the mandatory nature of the order under s. 100 and permitted the exercise of discretion by the court in certain limited circumstances, which the appellant claimed were applicable to him. The appeal was heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal with the appeal in the similar case ofR. v. Luke(1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 51.",

Whereas, in Dewald's case, the police had no information as to when the accused last consumed alcohol and so delaying the test was not justifiable. Arbour J.A. held that the police can only detain a suspect for an extra 15 minutes where there is some factual basis upon which to suspect that the screening device would yield an inaccurate result. 73I adopt the flexible approach taken by Arbour J.A. In my view, it is in accord with the purpose of the statutory scheme and ensures that a police officer has an honest belief based on reasonable and probable grounds prior to making a breathalyzer demand. Waiting 15 minutes is permitted under s. 254(2) of theCodewhen this is in accordance with the exigencies of the use of the equipment. This applies when an officer is aware of the potential inaccuracy in the particular case. 74Although there is no doubt that the screening test should generally be administered as quickly as possible, it would entirely defeat the purpose of Parliament to require the police to administer the screening test immediately in circumstances where the results would be rendered totally unreliable and flawed. The flexible approach strikes the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of drinking and driving, on the one hand, and the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. I do not believe that the matter is advanced by quoting statistics. Although we all agree that Parliament has every reason to vigorously pursue the objective of reducing the carnage on our highways, that objective is not advanced by subjecting innocent persons to invasions of privacy on the basis of faulty tests. I do not believe that this is what Parliament intended in enactings. 254of theCriminal Code. 75I note that a potential problem which may arise from delaying the screening test, and which was discussed by my colleague in his reasons as well as by Arbour J.A., is whether the suspect is entitled to access to counsel when detained for a longer period.",

It would indeed be strange for us to hold that the rights of some persons under one provision of theCharter(s. 8) must be sacrificed in order to preserve the limit on their rights under another provision (s. 10(b)). C.Application to the facts of this case 76In light of the above analysis, it is necessary to determine whether, on the facts of this particular case, the police officer had an honest belief on reasonable and probable grounds that the respondent had committed an offence under s. 253 of theCodenotwithstanding the potential unreliability of the screening device. 77As my colleague Cory J. noted, several other potential indicia of impairment were present in this case aside from the evidence provided by the screening test. Constable Mashford testified that he noticed a vehicle exceeding the speed limit and drifting, on two occasions, from the shoulder of the road to the centre and back with the brake lights flickering on and off. As well, upon questioning the respondent, a smell of liquor was detected and the respondent admitted that he had been drinking. Furthermore, Constable Mashford also noticed that the respondent's eyes were extremely red and glassy. Based on the foregoing, arguably the police officer could have had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breathalyzer even absent any screening device test results. In that case, the potential unreliability of the test results would not vitiate any belief based on reasonable and probable grounds. 78However, Constable Mashford testified as follows:",

Charges against the two were separately laid because of an administrative procedure applicable at that court which directs that younger accused be tried in Phase One youth court, and the older accused in Phase Two. J.P.M. was to be the Crown's main witness at the trial of R.J.S. However, after R.J.S. was arraigned but before he entered a plea, counsel for J.P.M. brought a motion to quash the subpoena which had been issued to compel J.P.M.'s testimony. The trial judge allowed the motion and quashed the subpoena. The Crown proceeded with the trial against R.J.S. and called two witnesses: Isaac Chung, the owner of the business where the offence allegedly occurred, and Detective Constable Carter.

Thelland was tried first before Pardu J. of the Ontario Court (General Division), and was acquitted of the charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. 6At the respondent's trial, which was also held before Pardu J., Thelland testified on behalf of the Crown. The explanation offered by Thelland for lying on his previous confessions was that he was a friend of the respondent. Thelland stated that during the police search, while in the kitchen, he told the respondent that he would take the blame for the offences. However, upon later realizing how serious the charge was, Thelland concluded that \"it wasn't worth it\". Thus, he went to the police and recanted his confessions. Thelland also stated that the drugs belonged to the respondent. He indicated that the basis of this knowledge was that he had seen the respondent dealing in drugs in the past. 7At trial, Thelland stated that he had no knowledge of the LSD border paper found in his room and that the LSD paper must have already been in the speakers when he purchased them from a friend, whom he declined to name. Thelland also testified that the wallet he was using belonged to Paciocco and he had no knowledge of the list of names found in it. He further denied that he was the owner of the LSD found under the sofa. He testified that he was on welfare and could not afford to buy a large quantity of drugs. However, Thelland admitted that the hash oil and the ten \"hits\" of LSD found in his room were for his personal use. 8Thelland agreed that it was possible that the zip-lock bag found under the couch could have come from a drawer in the kitchen to which everyone had access, although there was no evidence whether the respondent did, in fact, handle plastic bags in the kitchen. Paciocco was not called by the Crown and the respondent did not testify. 9The respondent was convicted on both counts and was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months on the first count and to a consecutive term of two months on the second count.",

The appellants were arrested on these charges in December, 1989, and were free on bail through to the commencement of their trial. The preliminary inquiry into these charges resulted in an order for the appellants to stand trial. 3Since the appellants elected trial by judge and jury, on March 20, 1992, a pre-hearing conference pursuant tos. 625.1(2)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(ad. R.S.C., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 127), took place. Given the complex evidentiary and constitutional issues raised by the appellants, McDonald J. directed that April 15, 1992 to May 1, 1992 be set aside for the trial judge to deal with all motions and evidentiary matters that could be determined in the absence of the jury. 4Before the hearing commenced, the appellants made a written request to the provincial prosecutor and to the Edmonton office of the Department of Justice, requesting that provincial and federal authorities disclose whether either of the appellants were named as primary or secondary targets in any undisclosedCriminal Code, Part VI electronic interceptions during the period 1988 to April 15, 1992. 5Counsel representing the provincial and federal governments notified the appellants that: (a)there were no provincial wiretap authorizations in effect pertaining to this particular investigation during the time period in question; (b)the provincial Crown declined to confirm or deny the existence of any other provincial authorization that may have been in existence during the same time period; and (c)the federal Crown refused to confirm or deny the existence of any such authorization during the relevant time period that may have been obtained in relation to matters under federal jurisdiction. It is very significant that the Crown disclosed that there were no wiretap authorizations pertaining to the investigation of the charges being tried in the time period in question. 6As a result of the Crown's refusal, the appellants applied for an order directing the Crown to answer the following question:",

The trial court heard the application on the basis of argument on first principles, and if first principles failed, the parties would be permitted to call evidence to address the issue of whether disclosure was required. 8The appellants' reasons for seeking disclosure from the Crown were three-fold: (a)to permit them to establish an evidentiary foundation for invoking the exclusionary rule in s. 189(2) of theCodedealing with derivative evidence; (b)to prepare for cross-examination of witnesses and fully explore the nature of the Crown's case in order to secure their right to a fair hearing as mandated bys. 7of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and (c)to determine whether their constitutionally mandated rights to a fair trial and consultation with counsel in private have been violated by police interception of privileged communications between them and their lawyers contrary toss. 7,10(b), and11(d)of theCharter. The respondent's reasons for refusing disclosure were: (a)to answer the question would effectively bar investigating bodies from the use of wiretap authorizations against persons charged with an offence or who may be charged with an offence if the only basis for the demand needs to be speculation without the necessity of showing any nexus between the disclosure sought and the case the accused is facing; (b)an answer to the question would not conclude the matter and the question could be raised up to the end of the trial; and (c)the circumstances of this case did not clearly trigger any of the provisions of s. 193(2).",

In aStinchcombeapplication, the initial onus of demonstrating the relevance to their case of the requested information was on the accuseds. The appellants admitted that they had no evidence to demonstrate the relevance to their defence of the information sought since they had no proof that there had been any wiretap authorizations or that there was derivative evidence obtained therefrom relevant to the charges. The appellants argued, however, that once the accused has made aStinchcombeapplication for disclosure, the onus was on the Crown to justify its refusal to disclose on the basis that the material was clearly irrelevant, or raised public interest privilege. 10The intervener, who had been brought into the proceedings on the appellants' motion requesting an order for disclosure of federal wiretap investigations, was granted leave to intervene in the Alberta Court of Appeal.

    "text": "1The appellant was convicted of two counts of assault causing bodily harm and two counts of choking with intent to commit an indictable offence. He was acquitted at trial of two other charges. The four charges arose out of two separate incidents relating to attacks on a female complainant (C.L.F.) in September 1986, and on a second female complainant (M.S.F.) in October 1986. Both victims were attacked immediately after leaving the underground parking area of their respective apartment buildings. Both women were beaten and choked and suffered bodily harm. 2On September 25, 1986, C.L.F. returned to her apartment building at about 1 a.m. She parked her car in the underground garage and went to the elevator. While waiting, she heard footsteps from behind but did not turn around. At that moment, she was attacked from behind as a black object came in front of her face and was then pulled tightly around her neck. After seeing her attacker briefly, C.L.F. passed out as a result of the choking. When she awoke, she noticed that her purse was gone. 3On October 28, 1986, M.S.F. returned to her apartment building between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. After parking her car in the underground garage she ran to the stairway leading to the foyer. She was confronted by a man who pushed her against a wall, punched her and then beat her and stomped on her. M.S.F. yelled \"fire\" and her assailant got up, looked at her and walked out the door. M.S.F. then went for assistance and was taken to the hospital. 4At trial, the appellant testified that, on the night of October 28, 1986, he was at a show from around 7:30 p.m. to 9:15 p.m. He claimed that, after leaving the show early, he then walked his dog and went to visit a friend who was not home. The appellant stated that he then drove to two bars and left his car at a parking garage around 11:25 p.m. Upon returning to his car, the appellant was arrested. This was approximately 2 1/2 hours after the attack of M.S.F. 5In order to refute the alibi of the appellant, the Crown called the evidence of Ms. Ruth Geurts in rebuttal.",

She testified that, at around 8:30 p.m. that evening, she had been followed by the appellant in his car, while driving to the garage of her apartment building. At the time this evidence was adduced, the Crown did not specify its purpose and no objection was taken to its admissibility. The appellant was permitted to call surrebuttal evidence in response. 6The appellant was tried by an all-female jury and was convicted on the four counts relating to the attacks on C.L.F. and M.S.F. Crown counsel had set out to empanel an all-female jury and succeeded in doing so by virtue of the formers. 634of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. That provision gave the Crown four peremptory challenges and 48 stand-bys while the appellant had only 12 peremptory challenges and no stand-bys. 7Identity was the only issue in dispute at trial. The appellant appealed the verdict based on three grounds. First, he argued that the convictions were unreasonable due to the frailty of the identification evidence. Secondly, he argued that the reply evidence of Ms. Geurts was not properly admissible, claiming that the Crown split its case. Finally, it was argued that, by empanelling an all-female jury, the Crown abused its use of the stand-by power which was still in effect at the time of the trial. 8The appeal was dismissed by a unanimous Court of Appeal for Ontario ((1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 756). Although it was recognized that the identification evidence was admittedly less than ideal, Doherty J.A. concluded that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have returned a guilty verdict on the four charges. The Court of Appeal also rejected the contention that the Crown's use of stand-bys to empanel an all-female jury would create a reasonable apprehension of bias. The final ground of appeal relating to the admissibility of the reply evidence also failed.",

    "text": "2The appellant, Crawford, and his co-accused, Creighton, were charged with second degree murder of Behnke. One night in early November 1988, Crawford and Creighton, who are distant cousins, went out drinking at a Belleville bar where they met and befriended the deceased, who was impaired. The three men left the bar together, all appearing to witnesses to be drunk, and the deceased was robbed and beaten with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber. The autopsy of the victim revealed that the immediate cause of death was a \"massive area of bruising\" within the victim's brain, consistent with the application of \"massive blunt force\" to the top of his head, but the pathologist did not rule out interplay between head injuries and serious injuries to other parts of his body. The cause of death thus was stated to be multiple trauma to the head and body. 3The Crown's theory was that Crawford and Creighton pretended to befriend the impaired deceased, invited him to a party with the intention of robbing him, and after robbing him, either Crawford or Creighton or both beat the deceased viciously with a 2 x 4 causing his death. 4Crawford made no statement to the police. He testified at trial, 13 months after the murder, that he had never struck the deceased and denied that he had aided or abetted in the assault. Crawford testified that, on leaving the bar with Creighton and the deceased, the deceased had grabbed the waitress's leg and apologized and Creighton had told the waitress that he would \"take care of it\". On the way to the party, Creighton hit the deceased without warning and the two exchanged about four punches before Crawford could intervene. He tried to grab the deceased but lost his balance and he and the deceased fell to the ground with the deceased on top. They began to scuffle when Creighton hit the deceased on the back with a 2 x 4. Crawford became scared, shoved the deceased off him, and ran away. When Creighton caught up to him, Creighton said \"I think I killed him\". 5Creighton's counsel cross-examined Crawford on Crawford's failure to make any statements to the police: Q.Mr. Crawford, if my memory is correct the incident that brings us here today happened one year and 20 days ago; is that right?",

Q.You were aware through your counsel what all the evidence was in this case? A.Well, yes. 6Creighton did not testify at trial. His version of the events was set out in a videotaped statement to the police on his arrest. Creighton said that he, Crawford, and the victim had left the pub on the way to a party. Crawford and the victim were arguing as they walked. When a fight broke out between Crawford and the deceased, Creighton intervened and tried to break it up. When that failed, since the deceased was on top of Crawford, he hit the deceased across the back about four times with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber (about 3 feet long). Crawford continued to beat the victim with his fists, despite Creighton grabbing Crawford and telling him to stop since the victim was already hurt. Unable to break up the fight, he climbed over a fence and left the scene. At the point that he left, Creighton told the police that the deceased was still alive. Crawford soon came running behind him saying that they had to \"get . . . out of here I think I killed him\". 7Effectively, each accused cast the blame primarily, if not entirely, upon the other, and each relied upon the defence of intoxication as negativing the intent for murder. At trial, Creighton's counsel made much of the fact that Crawford had declined to give a statement to the police on his arrest, contrasting unfavourably with Creighton's full statement to the police at the earliest opportunity.",

Conversely, Crawford's counsel, when addressing the jury, stated that \"an innocent man sitting in Creighton's seat would have gotten into that witness box and sworn that he was not guilty\". Crawford's counsel also dealt with Creighton's counsel's cross-examination of Crawford in his closing address to the jury. 8On November 28, 1989, the appellant and co-accused were both convicted of second degree murder by White J. of the Ontario Supreme Court sitting with a jury. They appealed their convictions to the Ontario Court of Appeal. Crawford claimed that: (1)the trial judge erred in allowing counsel for the co-accused to cross-examine him on his failure to give a statement to the police, thus infringing his right to remain silent; and (2)the trial judge had erred in not instructing the jury to disregard that cross-examination on his pre-trial silence.

They applied a second time to the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in order to have the subpoenas quashed. McFadyen J. (as she then was) dismissed the application on the same grounds as Berger J. did. XI.Jobin's trial finally began on January 4, 1993. At the outset of Jobin's trial, defence counsel announced that a police statement made by Jobin could be admitted without avoir dire. On this basis, the Crown agreed not to call any of the subpoenaed witnesses. Jobin's counsel later asserted the need for avoir dire. On March 8, 1993, a mistrial was declared because Crown counsel had referred to Jobin's police statement in the opening address to the jury. XII.On February 4, 1993, leave to appeal was granted at large by this Court, [1993] 1 S.C.R. vii. The motion book for leave covered three bases for seeking leave.

The issue of whether an accused, whose only acts in relation to the vehicle occurred while it was inoperable, can be said to be in care or control has not been resolved by this Court;Saunderssimply held that an inoperable motor vehicle was nonetheless a motor vehicle within the definition then contained in theCriminal Code. In this case the vehicle was operable and I would leave the issue of care or control in the case of an inoperable vehicle to another day when the point is both pertinent and fully argued. [88]I conclude that the trial judge erred in law by holding that the risk of danger was an essential element of the offence. B.Did the Trial Judge Err in Finding That There Was no Risk Here? [89]Even if, contrary to my view, risk is an essential element of the offence, I would uphold the Court of Appeal's decision to reverse the acquittals entered by the trial judge. The trial judge erred in law in holding that there was no risk of putting the vehicle in motion since the accused did not have the intention to do so. Although the trial judge correctly noted at para. 38 of his reasons that the absence of intention to put the vehicle in motion did not constitute a defence for the accused, he in effect made it so.

The instrument registered 99 and 97 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood. He was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit of 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood. [5]At the beginning of the trial, on June 19, 2008, counsel for Mr. Dineley advised the judge that he would not be able to complete the case for the defence that day. He intended to tender a toxicology report in support of aCarterdefence in order to challenge the accuracy of the breathalyzer test results; Crown counsel had asked to cross-examine the toxicologist on his report, but the latter was not present. The hearing started that day on the common understanding that the case for the defence would be continued on July 15, 2008 to enable the Crown to cross-examine the toxicologist. Both Crown and defence counsel were or ought to have been aware that the Amendments would come into force on July 2, 2008.Section 258(1)(c) of theCriminalCode, as amended by the Amendments, establishes a presumption of accuracy of breathalyzer test results and a presumption of identity of those results with the blood alcohol level of the accused at the time of the alleged offence. Under s. 258(1)(c), these presumptions will now be rebutted only if the accused leads evidence tending to show that the instrument malfunctioned or was improperly operated. The effect of that provision, together with s. 258(1)(d.01), is to eliminate theCarterdefence as an independent means to raise a reasonable doubt about the reliability of breathalyzer test results. [6]The trial judge did not allow the Crown to argue that the Amendments applied to preclude aCarterdefence. In his opinion, it was improper for the Crown to obtain an adjournment for purposes of cross-examining the toxicologist and then invoke the Amendments which came into force in the interim without having first warned defence counsel that it intended to do so. He accepted theCarterdefence and acquitted Mr. Dineley. [7]The summary conviction appeal judge held that it was not improper for the Crown to raise the issue of the applicability of the Amendments.",

Ciment Québec Inc. was dealing with the Provincial Bank, and Grégoire Doyon was one of the latter's managers. Grégoire Doyon took an interest in their file and obtained financing from his bank which put Ciment Québec back on its feet. Gustave Papillon, the president, directing mind and holder of the vast majority of shares in Ciment Québec Inc., appreciated Doyon's help and decided to reward him by paying him $3,000 a year for three years. However, it was preferable not to make the payments directly to Doyon by Ciment Québec, and it was agreed that they would be made through the respondent, a young lawyer admitted to the Bar in November 1975, and the son‐in‐law of Doyon, who made up fictitious bills for fees to Ciment Québec. Thus, $3,000 was paid in each of the years 1975, 1976 and 1977. As respondent had to pay tax on this income, after cashing the cheques he kept part to cover the additional tax he would have to pay and handed the remainder over to his father‐in‐law. Grégoire Doyon of course received less than $9,000 as a result of these deductions, a fact to which, noted the judge, no one raised any objection. The judge made another observation. The payments made to Grégoire Doyon were legitimate and caused no prejudice to Ciment Québec.",

She agreed. Approximately one week later, on November 12, they went out on a date and subsequently returned to her place. He says that they became quite intimate, removed substantially all of their clothing, fondled one another's private parts, talked of sex and birth control, and that she masturbated him to ejaculation. She maintains that they only kissed, talked of birth control, and talked about the fact that, as a born again Christian, she did not believe in premarital sex. Nothing else happened and he left at around 9:45 p.m. 6Thirteen days later, on November 25, the respondent, having driven all night from Winnipeg, called the complainant up at six in the morning from his cellular phone and asked if he could stop by. Although she had just gotten up for work, she assented since she thought he needed to talk. He arrived ten minutes later, having stopped to buy a condom at a nearby store. She greeted him at the door with a kiss on the cheek, clad only in her bathrobe. He entered and beckoned her to the couch and tried to kiss her. At this point, their stories diverge considerably. 7According to her, she pulled away and, seeing the condom in his hand, asked if that was \"why [he] came over here\". Distraught, she went to her room to take her sleeping 2-year-old child off her bed and took her to another room to change the child's diapers. The respondent followed her. After she had finished, he beckoned the complainant into the bedroom. She followed, thinking that he wanted to \"crash\", since he had driven all night before arriving at her door. She began to look in her closet for clothes to wear to work when she turned around and saw that the respondent had taken his shirt off. She claims that he drew her to him and kissed her and then pushed her onto the bed. She resisted actively, both verbally and physically, but he was stronger. She described in considerable detail the assault. Feeling his weight atop her, she had a flashback to a previous traumatic experience and went into \"shock\".",

Feeling his weight atop her, she had a flashback to a previous traumatic experience and went into \"shock\". The next thing she remembered, he was pulling his penis out of her and ejaculating on her stomach. She fled to the bathroom, needing to vomit. He dressed and kissed her goodbye on the cheek as he left. The complainant did not go to work that day, but instead went directly to see her counsellor, who testified to the fact of her emotionally agitated state on that particular day. 8By contrast, the respondent claims that they sat on her couch and kissed, and that he then asked to use the washroom. The complainant then took her sleeping child back to the child's bedroom, and the two of them entered the complainant's bedroom where they lay on the bed and began to kiss. She actively participated in the sexual activity. Her only resistance was that, when he pulled out the condom, she said \"no, not yet\". He therefore put the condom aside on the pillow. In his words, things then began to get \"hot\" and he prematurely ejaculated on her stomach. No intercourse took place. They talked for a short period of time. She got up and went to the bathroom. He dressed, kissed her goodbye and left. 9At trial, the respondent asserted that the complainant consented to the sexual activity or, in the alternative, that he had an honest but mistaken belief that she was consenting. Both the complainant and the respondent testified. A report from the medical examination of the complainant was admitted into evidence in an agreed-upon statement of facts. That report indicated no physical injury, but noted the presence of redness on the inner labia which could be consistent with either consensual or non-consensual intercourse. The trial judge refused to put the mistaken belief defence to the jury, finding there to be no air of reality to the defence, and concluding that the issue was simply one of \"consent or no consent\".",

He enumerated certain independent facts that, in his view, lent an air of reality to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent: the complainant's telephone overture to the respondent, the discussions of her use of birth control, and the fact that she met him with a kiss at 6:10 a.m. on November 25 wearing only her bathrobe. He also held the trial judge's instruction that the jury disregard the prior sexual activity to be in error, since it was relevant to the question of mistaken belief.

    "text": "3The facts and judgments relevant to this appeal may be briefly summarized. Crosby and Rines were tried separately. At Crosby's trial, which is the subject matter of this appeal, the complainant testified that she had been attacked by both men and forced to engage in non-consensual sexual acts with both. By contrast, Crosby testified that the complainant had consented throughout. The defence theory was that the complainant had fabricated the allegation of sexual assault against Crosby and Rines after she was confronted by her parents about her sexual activities. This theory was supported by the fact that the complainant only reported the sexual assault to police after her brother heard rumours of her sexual activities with Crosby and reported them to her parents, who then confronted her about them. The defence submitted that the complainant made up the story that she had been sexually assaulted because she was too embarrassed and ashamed to admit that she consented to sexual activities with two men. The defence did not raise at trial the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. 4In avoir direbefore the commencement of the trial, the defence sought permission from the trial judge to lead evidence or cross-examine the complainant on four different statements, all of which referred in some way to sexual activity other than that which formed the subject matter of the charge, and which thereby triggered s. 276 scrutiny. The trial judge allowed evidence to be led on one of the four statements, and excluded the other three. Crosby was convicted of sexual assault. 5Crosby appealed to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal on the basis that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence of the other three statements. The majority of that court upheld his conviction ((1994), 130 N.S.R. (2d) 61). Hallett J.A., dissenting, would have ordered a new trial on the basis that two of the three excluded statements regarding unrelated sexual conduct were relevant because they tended to prove a motive to fabricate. Crosby appeals as of right to this Court.",

    "text": "If in the present case the jury were satisfied that the car was driven towards the garage in pursuance of a murderous plan and that the appellant knew that that was the plan and intentionally drove the car in execution of that plan, he could be held to have aided and abetted even though he regretted the plan or indeed was horrified by it. However great his reluctance, he would have intended to aid and abet. 36The position at common law, of course, does not in and of itself determine the meaning to be ascribed to the word \"purpose\" in the context of s. 21(1)(b) of theCode. It can, however, provide useful guidance when it comes to choosing between the two interpretations of the term that are available -- one that accords with the common law position and the other that contradicts it. In the absence of reason to believe that Parliament intended its enactment of s. 21(1)(b) to radically alter the common law principles governing party liability, the interpretation that accords with the common law would seem to also be the most likely to accurately embody Parliament's intentions. This observation strengthens my conclusion that Parliament's use of the term \"purpose\" in s. 21(1)(b) should not be seen as incorporating the notion of \"desire\" into the mental state for party liability, and that the word should instead be understood as being essentially synonymous with \"intention\". 37This interpretation is, moreover, consistent with the approach that has been taken on previous occasions by this Court in connection with s. 21(1)(b). InR. v. Kirkness, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 74, for instance, Cory J. (writing for a majority of the Court) stated (at p. 88): [T]he person aiding or abetting the crime [of murder] must intend that death ensue or intend that he or the perpetrator cause bodily harm of a kind likely to result in death and be reckless whether death ensues or not. It is implicit in this statement that there is no requirement under s. 21(1)(b) that the person charged as a party \"desire\" that the victim die (that is, subjectively wish that this result come to pass), just as the principal's intent to kill is not negated even if, all other things being equal, he or she regrets the fact that he or she is killing the victim.",

She believed that he would cause her and their daughter serious bodily harm or death as he had threatened to do many times. [5]In September of 2007, she began to think about having her husband murdered. Over the course of the next seven months, she spoke to at least three men whom she hoped would kill him. In December 2007 or January 2008, she paid one man $25,000 to carry out the killing, but he then refused, demanding more compensation. She approached another person and was contacted by a third, an undercover RCMP officer, posing as a \"hit man\". On March 27, 2008, she met with this individual and agreed to pay him to kill her husband. The agreed upon price was $25,000, with $2,000 paid in cash that day. The killing was to take place the coming weekend. Later that same night, she provided an address and a picture of her husband to the \"hit man\". Shortly after, she was arrested and charged with counselling the commission of an offence not committed contrary tos. 464(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. [6]At trial, there was no issue that the elements of the offence had been proved and the trial judge, Farrar J.

He based this conclusion on the respondent's admission that the Crown had proved aprima faciecase and on the audio and video tapes of recorded conversations with the undercover officer and a statement made on arrest (trial judge's reasons, at paras. 4-6). The only issue at trial was whether the respondent's otherwise criminal acts were excused because of duress. The accused had raised that the common law defence of duress applied.

[7]The trial judge accepted the respondent's evidence that the relationship and the events she had described relating to that relationship were true. For example, Mr. Ryan's violent and threatening behaviour included outbursts at least once a week, where he would throw things at the respondent's head, physically assault her and threaten to kill her (trial judgment, at para. 17). The respondent testified that Mr. Ryan often told her that he would kill her and their daughter if she ever tried to leave him , and that he would \"burn the fucking house down\" while she and her daughter were inside . [8]The trial judge had no difficulty in concluding that Mr. Ryan was a manipulative, controlling and abusive husband who sought to control the actions of the respondent, be they social, familial or marital. The judge found that the respondent's sole reason for her actions was her fear of her husband which arose from his threats of death and serious bodily harm to herself and their daughter (paras. 149-52). He also was satisfied that the respondent had led evidence to the requisite standard that she reasonably believed that Mr. Ryan would cause her and her daughter serious bodily injury and that there was no safe avenue of escape other than having him killed. [9]The judge concluded that the respondent was in a very vulnerable state, had lost a considerable amount of weight, was dissociated and despondent. She had an intense and reasonable fear of Mr. Ryan, was feeling helpless, felt she had lost control and felt she was threatened with annihilation. While she had engaged the police and other agencies in an effort to assist her in the past, the evidence was that her problems were viewed as a \"civil matter\". She felt so vulnerable that the phone call of the undercover police officer appeared to her as the solution to all her problems .",

On the basis of these findings, the trial judge found that the common law defence of duress applied, and acquitted the accused. [10]The Crown appealed but the Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the trial judge's verdict of acquittal. On the appeal, for the first time, the Crown took the position that duress was not available in law as a defence to the respondent on these facts. Duress, the Crown contended, applies only when an accused is forced by threats to commit an offence against a third party (2011 NSCA 30, 301 N.S.R. (2d) 255, at para. 56). MacDonald C.J.N.S. (Saunders and Oland JJ.A. concurring) rejected the Crown's submission. Simply put, the Court of Appeal found that the focus of the defence of duress is to absolve an accused of criminal liability when his or her conduct is morally involuntary. Therefore, the analysis should focus on the accused's predicament and not on who did what to whom in who's presence. It followed that the respondent should not be denied the defence of duress simply because the victim was not a third party, but the aggressor. The court saw no principled basis to justify a distinction between the aggressor as opposed to a third party being the targeted victim. [11]The court reviewed the case law in this area which emphasizes the need for triers of fact to fully understand the plight of battered spouses who, having reacted to threats from their abusive partners, rely on the defence of duress. MacDonald C.J.N.S. also highlighted the need for the defence to be sufficiently flexible, when appropriate, to accommodate the dark reality of spousal abuse.",

Ultimately, individuals (some of whom are parties to this appeal and are referred to as the \"Other Individuals\") were charged with several violent crimes and it is in the context of their trial that the question of B's possible status as a confidential police informer arises. [58]If information provided by B met theStinchcombestandard, it would normally have to be disclosed:R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326. However, B claimed to have confidential police informer status: therefore, B's identity as the supplier of the information to the SQ was privileged and must not be disclosed. The Crown's position, however, is that B has no such status. [59]B's status of course could significantly affect the scope of the Crown's disclosure obligation to the Other Individuals at their trial. If B is a confidential source with respect to certain information, then B's identity as the supplier of that information must be kept confidential, along with any other information that could reveal B's identity as the source in that regard. None of this confidential information could be disclosed, subject only to an accused establishing that it falls within the \"innocence at stake\" exception or unless both B and the police waive the privilege. Otherwise, the confidentiality is absolute and disclosure cannot be made. The impact on disclosure is thus potentially considerable. [60]The Crown applied to the application judge for a determination of this issue and the application judge held that B was not a confidential informer with respect to information he supplied to the SQ. B.Issues [61]The principal issues, as the appeal has evolved, are these: 1.What are the concrete realities of this case and the proper limits of appellate review which form the basis for consideration of the appeal?",

In my view he did not. 3.Is there a live issue on this record as to whether there may have been an implicit promise of informer privilege by the SQ?

In this regard, he observed that the defence put forward by the appellant — his comments in the MSNchats to T were not to be taken seriously — \"did not depend on whether the appellant was a principal in, or a party to, the conspiracy\". If the jury accepted his position or it raised a reasonable doubt, he would be acquitted. On the other hand, if the jury rejected his position, \"a finding of guilt was inevitable\". Rosenberg J.A. further noted that the appellant's MSN chats with T constituted \"direct evidence, in his own words, of the appellant's role in the conspiracy\". It followed, in his view, that the \"[appellant's] liability as a party or a member of the conspiracy was overwhelming\" .",

An appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed, Abella J.A. dissenting. 11The appellant appeals as of right on the points of law raised in Abella J.A.'s dissent, i.e., whether the trial judge erred in law by characterizing the disclosure of the appellant's alibi defence as untimely or insufficient and if so, whether the error could be cured by the provisions ofs. 686of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46. 12Evidence was lead that on July 26, 1990, at 2:25 p.m., a man sold $40 worth of crack cocaine to an undercover officer, Constable Norman, in the area of Jane and Woolner Streets in Toronto. That person was wearing a yellow shirt and black pants with an unusual haircut featuring the design of an arrow shaved into the side of his head. Upon the completion of the transaction, he walked north through a hydro field towards an apartment complex. 13At 3:40 p.m. Constable Norman saw the appellant, dressed in a brown muscle shirt and blue jeans, coming south through the hydro field from the apartment complex. At a distance of 50 feet, Constable Norman identified the appellant as the man who had sold him cocaine earlier in the day and gave a signal to other undercover officers who arrested the appellant. 14The appellant presented alibi evidence that he was at home with his mother, Marvelyn Foster, at the time of the alleged sale. Both the appellant and his mother testified that the appellant did not own a yellow shirt or black pants, that the appellant had worn a brown muscle shirt and blue jeans throughout the day in question, and that the appellant had been in the house watching television and writing letters throughout the entire episode of the soap opera \"One Life to Live\" which ran from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. that day. 15The appellant's mother also testified that when she attended at the police station shortly after the appellant's arrest, she told the officers she was with the appellant at 2:30 p.m. Her trial testimony about this conversation was: Now did you talk to the police about where Devon [the appellant] was that day?",

    "text": "[22]In sum, collateral immigration consequences may be just as relevant in sentencing as the collateral consequences of other legislation or of circumstances specific to the offender. [23]Where the issue of immigration consequences is brought to the trial judge's attention and the trial judge applies the proper sentencing principles but nonetheless decides on a two-year sentence, then, absent fresh evidence, deference is owed to that decision. Where this issue has not been raised before the trial judge and the Crown does not give its consent, an affidavit or some other type of evidence should then be adduced for consideration by the Court of Appeal. [24]An appellate court has the authority to intervene if the sentencing judge was not aware of the collateral immigration consequences of the sentence for the offender, or if counsel had failed to advise the judge on this issue. In such circumstances, the court's intervention is justified because the sentencing judge decided on the fitness of the sentence without considering a relevant factor:M. (C.A.), at para. 90. As I explained above, however, the aim of such an intervention is to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the facts of the particular case while taking all the relevant factors into account. Although there will be cases in which it is appropriate to reduce the sentence to ensure that it does not have adverse consequences for the offender's immigration status, there will be other cases in which it is not appropriate to do so. [25]In the case at bar, the sentencing judge was not aware of the sentence's collateral immigration consequences, and the appellate court accordingly had the authority to intervene. The Crown conceded both in the Court of Appeal and at the hearing in this Court that a reduced sentence of two years less a day remains within the range of otherwise fit sentences and that the imposed sentence of two years' imprisonment should be reduced by one day. The Crown also agreed that the reduced sentence is the one that the sentencing judge would have imposed in the case at bar had he been aware of the collateral immigration consequences (R.F., at para. 69).",

C-46, in the context of the police wishing to have lawful access to the content of text messages. Before turning to an analysis of the specific legal issues we confront, I will set out some technical background about text messaging and the range of investigative techniques that may be open to the police to gain access to them. I will then set out a brief account of the proceedings which bring the case to us and the specific issues that we must resolve. A.Telus's Text Messaging Service [111]Text messaging, technically known as Short Message Service (\"SMS\"), is a communication service using standardized communications protocols and mobile telephone service networks to allow for the exchange of short text messages from one mobile phone to another. [112]Telus's system of text message delivery is the same as that of other telecommunications service providers. When a message is sent by a Telus subscriber, it is transmitted to a Telus cell tower and then routed to a Mobile Switching Centre (\"MSC\") which is the computerized mainframe to the Telus network. Within the MSC is Telus's Short Message Service Centre (\"SMSC\"), which uses routing engines to attempt to deliver the message to its destination. If the recipient is also a Telus subscriber, the message will then be sent from Telus's SMSC to a cell tower which will forward the message to the recipient's phone. If the recipient is not a Telus subscriber, the message will pass from Telus's SMSC to the SMSC of the recipient's provider and then through a cell tower to the recipient's phone. Where the destination phone is not available (for example, because it is turned off or does not have service reception), the text message remains in the Telus SMSC for up to five days. If the recipient phone does not become available within that timeframe, the message is deleted. The sender is not informed if a message is not delivered. [113]Telus differs from most other providers in that it makes electronic copies of the text messages that pass through its system and stores those copies in one of four computer databases for at least 30 days.",

    "text": "There are three PSMS databases (namely, PSMS 1 (primary database), PSMS 2 (secondary database), and PSMS 3 (tertiary database)) which receive messages within up to approximately 15 minutes of the time they are sent. Which PSMS a message goes to depends on the capacity of each database. All text messages received by a Telus customer are copied, and the copy is forwarded to the databases when the Telus subscriber's phone receives the message from the Telus SMSC. When a Telus subscriber sends a text message, it is copied when it arrives at the Telus SMSC and the copy is stored in a database. Telus also maintains a fourth database, named PECSMS, which receives messages between two to eight hours after they are sent. At the time this case was heard at first instance, Telus expected that by April 2011, PECSMS would be the sole repository for all text message content; it would cease to use the PSMS databases. [114]Telus copies text messages in order to facilitate troubleshooting and dealing with customer complaints. As I will explain, Telus in doing this is intercepting the messages and it has legal authority under theCodeto do so without a wiretap authorization. In my view, Telus's stated purpose, coupled with the fact that most other service providers in Ontario transmit text messages without storing copies of them in this manner, makes it clear that this additional step is not part of the communications process. Unlike e-mail messages, which must go through transient storage as they are transmitted, storage of the type in issue here is not inherent to the communication of text messages. B.Text Messages and Investigative Techniques [115]TheCodeprovides at least three potential ways for the police to obtain authorization to acquire the content of stored text messages from Telus: a production order, a general warrant and a so-called \"wiretap\" interception authorization. The police in this case sought and obtained a general warrant as a sort of enhanced production order, but Telus's contention is that they were required to seek a wiretap authorization. It will be helpful to describe these three investigative techniques briefly, because the requirements of each are somewhat interrelated.",

    "text": "A.Overview of the Facts [4]The respondent was charged with sexual assault of and sexual interference with his niece when she was between the ages of 12 and 14. The jury found the respondent guilty. The trial judge entered a conviction for sexual assault but stayed the sexual interference count because it was based on the same factual and legal foundation: seeKienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729;R. v. S.J.M., 2009 ONCA 244, 247 O.A.C. 178. The background as it emerged at trial is this. [5]The complainant's parents separated when she was nine years old. Her mother moved to Ontario while she continued to live with her father in a small town in Newfoundland and Labrador. Their home was next door to the respondent and his wife, who is her father's sister. When her father was away for work, the respondent and his wife were responsible for her care and even when her father was home, they would regularly all have supper together. [6]The complainant testified that she was prompted to disclose the respondent's conduct towards her by an incident in June 2008. She had missed the school bus and asked the respondent to drive her to school. During the drive, the respondent began to talk to her about sex and said, \"all you have to do is say the word and I'll make love to you\": A.R., vol. II, at p. 47. Later that day or the next day, the complainant called her mother in Ontario and told her about this incident. She then flew to Ontario to be with her mother. Her mother took her to a doctor who made a referral to child protection authorities which in turn led to police involvement. In late July, her mother accompanied her to the Port Elgin police station to make an initial videotaped statement in which she described one incident. [7]At trial, the respondent also testified about an incident in June. He agreed to drive the complainant to school after she missed her bus. He testified that he spoke to her about being careful not to become pregnant, a conversation he said was prompted by MSN blog messages she had written using his computer and the respondent's concern about the sexual nature of the messages and her use of alcohol.",

The respondent did not tell his wife or the complainant's father about his concerns or about the door-slamming incident. [8]RCMP officers in Newfoundland became involved in the investigation in late July 2008. RCMP Constable Paul Hierlihy reviewed the initial videotaped statement from Ontario but was not satisfied with the way the interview had been conducted. He therefore arranged for RCMP Constable Lisa Norman, who had received training in interviewing child victims of sexual abuse, to re-interview the complainant in Ontario. [9]Cst. Norman testified that the complainant's initial statement to Port Elgin police was conducted in the police station, with four persons present (the interviewing male police officer, a social worker, the complainant and her mother). In Cst. Norman's experience, interviewing an alleged child victim of sexual assault in the presence of her mother is not always helpful because it is not a topic that children are comfortable talking about. She saw no need for the presence of a social worker and noted that \"sometimes it helps talking to a female\" officer: A.R., vol. I, at p. 196. She agreed with Cst. Hierlihy's assessment that the original statement was vague and had a lot of \"I don't remembers\" and, in her view, there was not a good rapport between the interviewing officer and the complainant who appeared not to have been comfortable at that time. [10]In November 2008, Cst. Norman conducted her interview one-on-one with the complainant in a private hotel conference room, in order to avoid the police station which is sometimes \"intimidating\": A.R., vol. I, at p. 197. During this interview, the complainant described more incidents than she had in her initial statement. When Cst. Norman asked her about this, the complainant told her that she had not felt comfortable with the male officer and that she had not wanted to talk about it in front of her mother. [11]At trial, the complainant testified about several sexual incidents involving the respondent.",

The complainant also referred to an occasion on which the respondent had asked her if she was mad at him, and said, \"You know I love you and I wouldn't do anything to you like that\": A.R., vol. II, at p. 45. But she could not remember why he had said that. [12]The respondent testified in his own defence and denied any sexual activity with the complainant. The respondent's wife echoed the respondent's testimony. The respondent's brother and nephew testified that the complainant was quite affectionate towards the respondent, that she seemed comfortable when she was around him and, generally, that the respondent and the complainant seemed to enjoy a good relationship. B.The Trial Judge's Instructions to the Jury [13]The parties agree that the trial judge's instructions to the jury were error-free. She gave the usual instructions with respect to credibility and truthfulness generally, including the direction that the jury could believe or disbelieve all or parts of anything a witness said in the witness box. She specifically addressed the young age of the victim and instructed the jury that they could consider this factor along with lapse of time in dealing with minor discrepancies in the complainant's testimony. She however specified that lying under oath was serious and could taint the entire testimony of a witness. The trial judge stressed the fact that this case was about credibility and noted that there was no other direct evidence supporting the complainant's allegations. She gave a thorough summary of the evidence of the complainant and the respondent and clearly drew the jury's attention to the inconsistencies between the complainant's testimony and that of other witnesses and her own previous statements. [14]The trial judge directed the jury that it was \"essential that the credibility and reliability of [the complainant's] evidence be tested in the light of all the other evidence\": A.R., vol. I, at p. 69.",

She reviewed in detail the position of the defence that the complainant was not telling the truth, referring to several points at which her recollections were not consistent. The trial judge also noted that the defence theory was that the complainant lied because she wanted her mother to return to Newfoundland so that they could live together. She also reviewed in detail the position of the Crown, noting that the motive to lie alleged by the defence was never put to the complainant directly and further that her evidence was that she could have left Newfoundland to live with her mother at any time. [15]The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. C.The Judgment of the Court of Appeal, 2011 NLCA 59, 312 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 12 (per Barry J.A., Wells and White JJ.A. Concurring) [16]The Court of Appeal concluded that the jury's verdict was unreasonable, set it aside and acquitted the respondent. The court stated that in conducting a review for unreasonableness, \"the appellate court draws its own inference from the evidence admitted at trial as to the reasoning process of the jury and determines whether this could have been logical or rational in light of the verdict being reviewed. . . . If no reasonable process of analysis by a judge could justify conviction in the circumstances of the case, an appellate court will be justified in concluding a jury must not have acted judicially in convicting\": paras. 47 and 52. [17]After reviewing the record, the court concluded that the verdict was unreasonable because \"[a]n experienced judge sitting alone, with the evidence presented in this case, would not be able to provide adequate reasons to explain how he or she could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt in light of the credibility concerns arising from the unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities arising from the complainant's testimony and statements\": para. 75. [18]The Court of Appeal was troubled by a number of inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony and statements, even taking into account \"all explanations given by her for those inconsistencies\": para. 64. [19]First, the Court of Appeal was concerned by inconsistencies regarding the number and nature of the incidents between the complainant's trial evidence and her initial disclosure.",

As noted earlier, when the complainant later spoke to a female police officer, she described more incidents as she did at trial. The court noted that the complainant said that she felt more comfortable speaking alone to the female RCMP constable and wanted to avoid the embarrassment of speaking in the presence of her mother. However, the court reasoned that \"[d]iscomfort and embarrassment may help explain omitted incidents [but] they do not adequately explain her express denial that any other incidents had occurred\": para. 66. The court was also concerned that the complainant \"contradicted herself somewhat in her explanation in that at the preliminary inquiry she had said her memory had improved between the first and second police interviews while at trial she said she had deliberately decided not to discuss all incidents\": para. 66. [20]A second matter referred to by the Court of Appeal as creating a \"serious concern about [the complainant's] truthfulness overall\" was this: the complainant told the male police officer at the initial interview that the only incident happened in the respondent's home and nowhere else. But she testified at trial that the most serious incident happened in the respondent's vehicle. She explained this inconsistency by saying that she felt discomfort speaking to a male police officer in her mother's presence. With regard to the complainant's explanation of this inconsistency, the Court of Appeal indicated that \"discomfort would go somewhat towards explaining omissions but does not adequately explain her express denial of other locations\": para. 67. [21]A further point which troubled the Court of Appeal was the fact that in her initial statement to the male police officer, the complainant had said that the respondent had been alone in the house when she had been assaulted, while she later said that the respondent's wife had been present on one occasion in the same room and that the respondent's wife and the complainant's father had been present on another occasion in a different room but within hearing range.",

These included: the complainant's father's denial of the complainant's testimony that she had told him she did not want to go to her uncle's home; the complainant's willingness to continue having interactions with the respondent even after the incidents; and the fact that the complainant declared at the preliminary inquiry that she was not afraid to be alone with her uncle in his car yet she had told police in a prior statement that she was \"frightened to death\" to drive alone with him: para. 70. [23]In the Court of Appeal's view, the complainant's inability to give any detail regarding the nature of the other incident which she vaguely recalled added \"some slight additional doubt regarding her credibility\": para. 73. [24]The Court of Appeal concluded that by virtue of these \"unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities alone, the credibility of the complainant was damaged to the extent that it is questionable whether a jury acting judicially could reasonably have convicted\": para. 74. The court noted that in addition, a jury acting judicially has to consider the complainant's testimony in the context of the respondent's denial of all her allegations. In the court's view, \"[n]othing appears from the transcript which should have caused a juror to question his truthfulness\": para. 74. In light of the complainant's testimony and the apparently plausible denial of the accused, the court was of the view that no experienced judge sitting alone would have been able to provide adequate reasons for the guilty verdict. The Court of Appeal concluded that the jury could not have been acting judicially in reaching a guilty verdict and that the verdict was therefore unreasonable.",

    "text": "6.At trial both parties agreed that it was the acts of Hill which caused the death of Pegg but dis­agreed otherwise. The position of the Crown at trial was that Hill and Pegg were homosexual lovers and that Hill had decided to murder Pegg after a falling out between them. The Crown argued that Hill deliberately struck Pegg in the head while Pegg lay in bed. This did not kill Pegg who immediately ran from the bedroom into the bathroom to try and stop the flow of blood from his head. Realizing he had been unsuccessful, Hill took two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death. 7.Hill's version of the events was very different. He admitted to causing the death of Pegg but put forward two defences: self‐defence and provocation. Hill testified that he had known Pegg for about a year through the latter's involvement with the \"Big Brothers\" organization. Hill stated that on the night in question he had been the subject of unexpected and unwelcome homosexual advances by Pegg while asleep on the couch in Pegg's apartment. Pegg pursued Hill to the bathroom and grabbed him, at which time Hill picked up a nearby hatchet and swung it at Pegg in an attempt to scare him. The hatchet struck Pegg in the head. Hill then ran from the apartment but returned shortly afterward. Upon re‐entering the apartment, he was confronted by Pegg who threatened to kill him. At this point, Hill obtained two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death. 8.Hill was arrested, after a car chase with the police, at the wheel of a Pontiac automobile owned by Pegg. At the scene of arrest Hill denied knowing Pegg, but later he made a statement to the police which was substantially similar to his oral testimony at trial.",

    "text": "2The appellant, F.J.U., emigrated from Peru to Canada in 1975, shortly after the birth of his daughter J.U. His daughter remained in Peru with her grandmother C.O.-V., the appellant's mother, until December 1987, when they both joined the appellant in Canada. The three shared a residence in Mississauga along with the appellant's brother until the spring of 1988, when C.O.-V. returned to Peru and the appellant and his daughter moved to Brampton. In September 1988, C.O.-V. returned to Canada, and from September 1988 to October 11, 1988 (the date of the appellant's arrest) she resided with the appellant and J.U. in Toronto. 3On October 11, 1988, C.O.-V. reported to the police that the appellant had engaged in sexual activities with his daughter. The police went to the U.'s residence, in the company of a Spanish interpreter, and spoke to J.U. The appellant was arrested and taken to the police station. J.U. and her grandmother were taken to the police station in a separate car. 4After arriving at the police station, J.U. was interviewed by Sergeant Hector Colantoni, the investigating officer. Her grandmother was present during the interview, as was Constable Tom Job, a Spanish-speaking officer who acted as an interpreter when J.U. had difficulty understanding Sergeant Colantoni's questions or responding to them in English. In the course of the interview, J.U. stated that her father had been having sexual intercourse with her on a regular basis since December 1987 when she came to Canada. She told the police that these incidents occurred more frequently after her grandmother had returned to Peru in April 1988, and that between this date and her grandmother's return to Canada in September 1988 her father had sex with her \"almost every day\". She declared that the sexual activity generally took place late at night in her bedroom. She also indicated that on a few occasions the appellant had had her perform oral sex on him, and that on a few other occasions he had performed oral sex on her. In addition, she stated, the appellant \"would have sex in my bum many times\". The last time her father had had sex with her, she declared, was the previous night (October 10, 1988).",

J.U. also stated that the appellant had physically assaulted her on two separate occasions, the first time striking her with a length of wire, and the second time punching her in the face. At the appellant's trial, Sergeant Colantoni testified that he had attempted to tape his interview with J.U., but that the tape recorder had malfunctioned and nothing had been recorded. He stated that he had subsequently prepared a summary of J.U.'s anticipated evidence, based in part on notes he had made during the interview and in part on his memory. 5After interviewing J.U., Sergeant Colantoni proceeded to question the appellant, accompanied by Constable Tony McKenzie. Sergeant Colantoni testified that he took notes and that the interview was not taped. According to Sergeant Colantoni's testimony, the appellant admitted that he had had sex with his daughter \"many times\", and also stated that she had performed oral sex on him \"two or three times when we lived in Mississauga, but she didn't like it\". He also declared that he had performed oral sex on her \"once or twice\". Sergeant Colantoni also testified that the appellant had further admitted to having had anal sex with J.U. \"three or four times\", stating that this had taken place most recently \"last night\" (i.e., October 10, 1988). The appellant also described two incidents in which he had physically assaulted his daughter, stating that on one occasion he had struck her with a wire-reinforced belt, and that on the second occasion he had slapped her in the face. The appellant refused, however, to make a written statement, and indicated that he would not sign anything. 6The appellant was charged with three counts of sexual interference (s. 151, of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46), one count of incest (s. 155) and one count of anal intercourse (s. 159). The terms of the indictment were particularized as follows: Count 1:Touching the mouth of J.U. with his penis for a sexual purpose, between September 1 and October 10, 1988, in Toronto. Count 2:Anal intercourse with J.U. on or about October 10, 1988, in Toronto.",

His statement to the police, which Allen J. ruled had been made voluntarily and obtained in accordance with theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, was admitted as Crown evidence through the testimony of Sergeant Colantoni and Constable McKenzie. The Crown also called J.U. as a witness. Although she admitted that she had made the allegations against the appellant contained in the \"will-say\" statement that had been drafted by Sergeant Colantoni following his interview with her, J.U. asserted that the allegations of sexual assault were untrue. She maintained, however, that the allegations of non-sexual assault she had made in her statement were true. According to J.U.'s trial testimony, she had lied to the police at the behest of her grandmother, because she was concerned that her father was planning to send her back to Peru to live with her mother. She stated that her grandmother had threatened to commit suicide if J.U. were taken away from her, and had given J.U. instructions about details of the false allegations of sexual misconduct she was to make. 8The appellant also testified at trial. While he admitted having made an inculpatory statement to the police, he denied the truth of much of the statement's contents. He testified that the conduct of the police during the interview had brought back memories of his imprisonment and torture by the Peruvian police, and that his resulting fear had led him to make a false confession.",

In particular, he denied having told the officers that he had had anal intercourse with his daughter, or telling them that his sexual activity with J.U. was intended to \"protect\" her from having sex with other people.

[22]Doyon J.A. provided a good overview of the general context in his reasons for the Court of Appeal's decision (2012 QCCA 906 (CanLII)): [translation]In the middle of the night, several members of the group moved on to another restaurant/bar, on Ontario Street. Around 5:00 a.m., they were asked to leave the premises. Some of them gathered in the alley behind the bar. A verbal altercation broke out between the victim and Pierre Mumpereze, also known as \"Peter\", the appellant's cousin. A man named Rassem Chamaa intervened, but not for long, as things went no further. He saw the two men who had been arguing head toward Ontario Street. A few minutes later there was another altercation, in which the appellant was involved, that ended in the death of Mr. Rushemeza. The appellant would be found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to imprisonment without eligibility for parole for at least 12 years. [para. 10] [23]Although the different accounts of what happened are contradictory in some regards, they are consistent as they relate to the essential elements. [24]There are some facts that are worth noting. From a fair distance away, the appellant saw that his cousin was involved in a fight with the victim, and he decided to run to where his cousin was and to intervene by pushing the victim back in order to get his cousin out of harm's way. He then noticed that his cousin was seriously wounded in the throat and that the victim was brandishing an exacto knife, using it to threaten the members of the group the appellant was with. [25]After pushing the victim, who was trying to defend himself by threatening his assailants with his knife, the appellant saw the victim drop his knife. Fearing for his life should the victim pick his weapon up, the appellant then used his own knife, the blade of which was 20 centimetres long, to stab the victim several times. [26]According to the Crown's theory, the appellant intentionally caused the victim's death to take revenge for what the victim had done to his cousin. According to the appellant, he stabbed the victim in response to an act of provocation.",

    "text": "According to the appellant, he stabbed the victim in response to an act of provocation. Doyon J.A. explained the defence's theory as follows: [translation]The appellant argued before the jury that he had had no choice. Reacting emotionally and being \"out of it\", to avoid being a victim himself, he had to defend himself by stabbing Mr. Rushemeza with his knife before Mr. Rushemeza had time to pick his own weapon up. He struck without really knowing what part of the body he had hit or how many times he had stabbed him. He never intended to wound the victim seriously while being reckless as to whether death ensued. He was afraid for his life after seeing his cousin stabbed in the throat by an aggressive person who was armed and was bigger than him, and who was threatening him. He acted as he did in self‐defence, to save his life, without there being time for his passion to cool. [para. 32] [27]At the end of the pre‐charge conference, the appellant suggested that the trial judge put both self‐defence and provocation to the jury as defences. [28]The trial judge, Champagne J., citing,inter alia, the comments made by my colleague Moldaver J. inR. v. Pintar(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), stated: [translation]So, after considering the view expressed by my colleague Moldaver J.A. inPintarand briefly reviewing the evidence produced by Mr. Buzizi before the triers of fact, I found it unlikely that Mr. Buzizi could not have intended to kill the victim; this is because he had in his possession a 30‐centimetre‐long knife that he plunged at least twice into the victim's back to a depth of 18 centimetres while the victim was bent over. I also took into account from the testimony of the accused that he was scared and highly emotional, that he was afraid, that the guy, that is to say, the victim, was a big, burly man, that his life was in danger, that his cousin's throat had been cut and that he himself had been attacked. As a result, I conclude that the only defence I should put to the jury is the one provided for ins. 34(2)of theCriminal Code of Canada. [A.R., at pp. 2182‐83]",

    "text": "A.Overview of the Facts [6]On May 21, 2007, users of the washroom at a Wal-Mart store discovered a puddle of blood on the floor of one of the stalls and heard the sounds of a young woman who we know now to have been the respondent struggling inside. The customers alerted the store staff, but when an assistant manager asked the young woman if she was all right, she responded from inside the stall that she was fine. [7]Shortly thereafter, a customer reported that she had discovered a baby's arm sticking out of the toilet bowl of the stall where the young woman had been. Other customers had seen the baby by that point, but all of them thought it was dead. When the store manager went into the bathroom to see what was happening, he observed that the baby's leg had started twitching. He pulled the baby out of the toilet. An emergency response team was called and the baby, A.J.H., was transported to the hospital where he was successfully resuscitated and found to be completely healthy. [8]Police gave video surveillance tapes of the store to various media outlets and the respondent was eventually identified as the woman seen entering and leaving the washroom at the time in question. When contacted by police, she cooperated fully and confirmed that she was the mother of the child. She was charged with unlawfully abandoning a child under the age of 10 years and thereby endangering his life contrary tos. 218of theCode. [9]At her trial, the respondent testified. She was 22 years of age by that time and was living with her boyfriend and their baby, S.K. Prior to the birth of A.J.H., she had been gaining weight and so she had taken three home pregnancy tests, all of which were negative. She did not believe she was pregnant because she had been getting her period every month prior to the birth. When she arrived at the Wal-Mart store, she was not feeling well and so she went to the bathroom, where she gave birth a minute or two later. She was surprised by the birth. She did not try to pick the baby up because it was all blue and she thought it was dead.",

[10]When she heard the police were looking for her, the respondent told her mother she was the one that had given birth to the baby in the store. When she found out the baby was alive, she was eager to see him. He now lives with the respondent's mother and the respondent visits him almost every day.

As for the fault element, the trial judge decided that subjective fault was required. He therefore expressed the issue he had to decide as follows: \". . . whether the accused . . . intended to abandon the child, A.J.H., or did so recklessly with full knowledge of the facts and circumstances or was wilfully blind in respect to them\" . [12]The trial judge answered this question in the negative and found that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent intended to abandon her child (paras. 23-26). The accused had been credible in her testimony. She had not known she was pregnant and truly believed she had delivered a dead child. Her fear and confusion explained her subsequent behaviour. The trial judge also relied on the evidence of Dr. Simpson, who testified that, \"[u]nder these circumstances of an unknown pregnancy and a premature, precipitous birth, it is understandable that the accused thought the child was not alive and that she would be scared or panicked, not request help and immediately leave the scene of the birth\" .

[5]Before I discuss the questions of law raised by this appeal, a brief review of the facts is therefore in order. [6]The appellant met Marc Laliberté in 2000 and decided to move in with him in Chibougamau with her daughter Joëlle from a previous union. The couple had two other children: Marc‐Ange, born in 2001, and Louis‐Philippe, born in 2004. They moved to Amos in 2002. Misfortune seemed to dog the family. The appellant was sexually assaulted, and this caused her considerable emotional distress as a result of which she was unable to leave the family home for very long. Marc Laliberté lost his mother and fell into a deep depression. Hoping for better luck, the family left Amos for Saguenay, where Kathie Ouellet, a childhood friend of the appellant's, lived. Marc Laliberté sold the family home and quit his job, and the family settled into their new surroundings. However, their new life got off to a rough start. [7]Once in Saguenay, Marc Laliberté had difficulty finding a stable job and resigned himself to receiving employment insurance benefits. Meanwhile, the appellant was unable to hold on to the few short‐term jobs she was able to find. In short, the couple encountered ever greater financial difficulties, and were forced to make an assignment in bankruptcy in October 2008. [8]The holiday season was drawing near. On Christmas Eve, despite their bad luck, the couple decided to give the children the chance to enjoy this \"festive\" period. Marc Laliberté refused to pay the rent for December, and used the money so saved to buy numerous gifts for the children and for friends. [9]On December 27, 2008, the appellant renewed her and her spouse's prescriptions for oxazepam, a soporific drug used to treat anxiety attacks, giving false reasons for doing so early. She told the pharmacist that her spouse was going through a difficult period and that they were about to go on a trip. While at the drug store, she also purchased some children's Gravol.",

That same day, the family went to Normandin to visit members of Marc Laliberté's family for a few hours. [10]On December 28, 2008, the appellant sent an e‐mail message entitled [translation]\"a miracle, please\" to the Fondation maman Dion in which, after recounting the family's difficulties, she asked for help. She wrote: \". . . I would like a miracle for Dec. 31, 2008\".

[12]On December 31, according to the appellant, her spouse spent the morning working on the computer, and he turned the screen off every time she came near. Around noon, he joined her in the kitchen. He told her that he had made a decision and that the whole family would be leaving together. He then dictated some documents to her that she wrote down like a robot, she said, after which she had no memory of what was in them. Marc Laliberté then left the house. According to the appellant, it was then that she noticed some papers left on the kitchen counter, and after reading them, she realized what was going on.

She claimed to have understood from the expression on her spouse's face that he had resigned himself to abandoning the dark plan. [13]The appellant testified that the rest of the day was uneventful.

[14]The physical evidence that was filed included two torn‐up documents that had been found in the garbage can: a handwritten joint will, in the appellant's hand, and a document prepared on the computer by Marc Laliberté in which he told his life's story. Another copy of the will, typed out and signed by both spouses, was found on the kitchen island. Three handwritten letters from Cathie Gauthier to her friend Kathie Ouellet, to her biological mother and to her last employer completed the evidence. All these letters mentioned that the couple had decided together to end their and their children's lives. Some empty medicine bottles, as well as the prescriptions for oxazepam and the drug store's sales slip dated December 27, 2008, were also found in the kitchen. [15]During the evening of January 1, 2009, the appellant called the emergency services number, asked for an ambulance and told the operator that her left wrist was slit, saying that [translation]\"it was a pact, my husband killed our three children\", and adding that\"we told ourselves we wouldn't start 2009, but . . .\". [16]When first responders arrived on the scene, they found the appellant with an injured wrist and pronounced her spouse and their three children dead. The evidence shows that the children were poisoned with Gravol and oxazepam. Traces of oxazepam were also detected in the appellant, whose left wrist had allegedly been slit by her spouse, Marc Laliberté.",

They were arrested and placed in custody on May 30, 1986, and have been in continuous custody since then. They pleaded not guilty and waived their right to a preliminary inquiry. 3At their first trial, on December 23, 1986, the appellants were found guilty of all three counts of conspiracy by a jury but a conviction was only registered with respect to the first count. The appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial, the appellants had twice tried unsuccessfully to subpoena a police informer, \"Billy Joe\" (who was not a police officer), to have his testimony heard. The trial judge refused, however, holding that the name of the informer was privileged. Billy Joe was a crucial contact person during the investigation of the appellants by the undercover police officers. The defence was that discussions had taken place between the appellant, Khela, and Billy Joe, and $8000 had been paid to Billy Joe to buy a stolen car, as part of a conspiracy between Billy Joe and Khela to import stolen vehicles into the United States. A total amount of $20,000 would be paid, and $8000 of this amount had already been paid to Billy Joe. The Crown's theory was that the money had been paid to have an airplane blown up. 4The appellants' appeal (notice of appeal filed January 20, 1987) was allowed by the Court of Appeal (No. 1) ((1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 81) on September 9, 1991, and a new trial was ordered. Proulx J.A., writing for the court, held that the identity of the police informer was not privileged, should have been disclosed, and ordered a new trial.

Whatever may have been their past practice in this regard, judges should be encouraged to carefully scrutinize claims of relevance in a manner that is sensitive to the therapeutic context and the nature of records created in that context. Without such sensitivity, the danger is great that records having no real relevance will be produced, the search for truth frustrated, and the rights of complainants needlessly violated. 146In establishing the required evidentiary basis, the applicant may resort to the Crown's disclosure, to its own witnesses, and to cross-examination of the Crown witnesses at both the preliminary inquiry and the trial. On some occasions, it may also be necessary to introduce expert evidence to lay the foundation for a production application (for instance, expert evidence to the effect that a certain type of therapy may lead to \"created memories\"). The determination of relevance is a fluid, rather than fixed, process. In consequence, information which cannot be proved relevant at one point during the trial may later become relevant, in which case a further application for production may be warranted. However, regardless of when it is brought, an application for production will not succeed if it is not supported by evidence demonstrating the likely relevance of the records.",

The appellant Women in Crisis (Algoma) Inc., operating as \"Women's Outreach\", is a partially publicly funded organization where L.L.A. sought counselling in November, 1992. It provides counselling to adult women who are victims/survivors of sexual abuse, sexual assault, family violence and other types of violence against women. 9At the preliminary inquiry on June 2, 1993, the respondent was committed to stand trial.

He held: In view of the way that these matters were brought before me, the issue is not whether this is a fishing expedition because that is an issue of a bona fide need for the evidence which was subsumed under the question of relevance. This argument advances the issue of privilege. Loukidelis J. observed that there was no statutory basis for the claim of privilege and that the traditional classes of privilege created by the common law, such as the solicitor-client privilege, were not applicable. He concluded that the records were not privileged and ordered that all records sought be produced to the respondent, subject to the condition that no copies be made. He then granted an adjournment to allow the parties to assess their respective positions. Given the appellants' intention to appeal the order for production, Loukidelis J. ordered a stay of his order until the appeals were disposed of. The appellants filed notices of appeal on March 17, 1994, at which time the respondent brought applications to quash the appeals. 11On January 6, 1995, the Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction in a unanimous decision (A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.)(1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 170). Relying upon the decision of this Court inDagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, the Court of Appeal concluded that there was no provision under theCodeallowing for interlocutory appeals either for parties or third parties from rulings at trial relating to the admissibility of evidence or documents. As such, it held that the appellants had no right to appeal to the Court of Appeal until there had been a final verdict at trial. As a result, the Court of Appeal ordered the production of the documents and directed that the trial before Loukidelis J. proceed. 12Pursuant tos. 40(1)of theSupreme Court Act, the appellants applied for leave to appeal to this Court from Loukidelis J.'s order for the production of the documents.

At the request of the Crown, the trial judge imposed a ban on the publication of the complainant's name pursuant tos. 486(4)of theCriminal Code. 3During the course of the trial, Feehan J. found that the complainant was a prostitute. The trial judge further held that the complainant had agreed to engage in prostitution with Mr. Adams. 4The evidence led at trial was confusing and contradictory. While the complainant claimed that Adams had threatened her with a sword and forced her to perform sexual acts, Adams stated that he had refused to engage in sexual acts with the complainant upon learning that she was pregnant. In addition, Adams claimed that the complainant had stolen $900 from his wallet, and that when he had discovered that the money was missing, the complainant became hysterical and attacked him with a sword. 5After reviewing all of the evidence before him, Feehan J. found that he was unable to determine exactly what happened on the night in question. Neither the complainant nor the accused had given completely reliable evidence, and the various allegations could not be verified by independent witnesses. As a result of these findings, the trial judge made the following statement: There is an important rule of law which applies in this case as it applies in all criminal cases and it is known as the presumption of innocence. To be put simply, it means that the accused person is presumed to be innocent until the Crown has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence and the burden of proof in a criminal case are inseparable. The onus or burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the Crown, and that burden never shifts. There is no burden on the accused to prove his innocence. The Crown must prove each and every ingredient of the offence charged beyond a reasonable doubt. If a judge believes the complainant, he may convict. If he believes the accused, most times he must acquit, but there is something in between.",

Norman Eugene Thibert married his wife, Joan Thibert, in July 1970. The couple had two children, Michelle and Catrina, aged 22 and 19 respectively at the time of the trial. 38The Thiberts' marriage had its share of problems. Early on in the marriage, Mr. Thibert admitted to his wife that he had had three extramarital affairs. In September 1990, Mrs. Thibert began an intimate relationship with the deceased, a co-worker. She disclosed this relationship to her husband in April 1991. He was distraught and eventually convinced his wife to remain with him and attempt to make their marriage work. 39On July 2, 1991, Mrs. Thibert decided to leave her husband. She took a hotel room rather than returning home. The appellant drove around the city that evening, unsuccessfully searching for the hotel where his wife was staying. When he returned home, he removed a rifle and a shotgun from the basement of the house to the garage. He testified that he thought about killing the deceased, his wife, or himself. He loaded the rifle, and then left the guns in a corner of the garage, having at that point abandoned his violent thoughts. 40The daughter, Catrina arrived home to find her father very upset. He told her of her mother's affair. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Mrs. Thibert telephoned her husband at home to tell him of her decision to leave him. At his request, she agreed to meet him the next morning, at Smitty's Restaurant in St. Albert, a suburb of Edmonton at 7:00 a.m. 41The next morning Mr. Thibert and Catrina went to the restaurant to meet Mrs. Thibert who arrived at the meeting with the deceased. The appellant attempted to persuade her to return home with him, but she refused. The meeting at Smitty's lasted approximately one hour. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Thibert promised not to bother his wife at work, and in return, she promised to think about coming home that night to again talk to him. Outside the restaurant, while waiting for Mrs. Thibert to finish talking with Catrina, the appellant told the deceased, \"I hope you intend on moving back east or living under assumed names....",

He sawed off the barrel of the shotgun, but then discovered that the gun was inoperable since the firing pin was broken. 43He telephoned his wife at work several times in an effort to persuade her to return to him. 44During one afternoon call, she asked him to stop phoning her and told him that she was leaving work to make a bank deposit. The appellant then drove into the city, planning to find his wife while she was at the bank, and away from the influence of the deceased, and again attempt to convince her to give the marriage another try. 45He put the loaded rifle in the back of his car before departing, thinking that he might have to kill the deceased. He testified that a few miles from home he abandoned that thought, but instead planned to use the rifle as a final bluff to get his wife to come with him. The police later seized a box of shells from the vehicle, although the appellant stated that he did not remember placing the ammunition in the car. 46At approximately 2:45 p.m., the appellant parked across the street from his wife's place of work.

He suggested that he would have to go into Mrs. Thibert's workplace and use the gun. At that time, the deceased came out of the building and began to lead Mrs. Thibert back into the office. The appellant then removed the rifle from the car. 48The appellant's evidence was that the deceased began walking towards him, with his hands on Mrs. Thibert's shoulders swinging her back and forth, saying, \"You want to shoot me? Go ahead and shoot me.\" and \"Come on big fellow, shoot me. You want to shoot me? Go ahead and shoot me.\" At some point, Mrs. Thibert either moved, or was moved aside.

The appellant testified that his eyes were closed as he tried to retreat inward and the gun discharged. 49After the shot, Mrs. Thibert ran into the office building.

For a time, Louis-Joseph Comeau, Édouard Collin, and Patrick Cloutier were also detained at the same detention centre. The respondent introduced Mr. Comeau to Mr. Cloutier as his [translation] \"contract killer\". At times, Mr. Cloutier passed on messages from Mr. Comeau to the respondent. [4]Based on the statements of Édouard Collin and Patrick Cloutier, various charges of uttering threats were laid against the respondent and Mr. Comeau. Mr. Comeau was convicted of uttering threats in a separate trial (R. v. Comeau, 2010 QCCQ 20939 (CanLII)). At issue on this appeal are five counts of knowingly conveying to Patrick Cloutier and Édouard Collin, at various times between June 1, 2009, and September 5, 2009, threats to cause death or bodily harm, contrary tos. 264.1(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to: theCrownprosecutor; an officer-investigator; and four witnesses involved in the case being brought against the respondent and Mr. Comeau for trafficking narcotics. [5]At trial, it was established, among other things, that the respondent had: (1) told Mr. Collin that he would take down the guys at the top to rearrange the face of theCrownprosecutor and one of the witnesses because he thought that he was the one who snitched on him; (2) informed Mr. Cloutier that he had hired a private detective to find theCrownprosecutor's address; (3) asked Mr. Cloutier to do what was necessary to find the address of the officer-investigator; and (4) told Mr. Cloutier that once his trial was over he would kill the witnesses who had informed against him (2010 QCCQ 9043 (CanLII), at para. 6). B.Court of Québec, 2010 QCCQ 9043 (Decoste J.) [6]The respondent did not testify at trial (appeal decision, 2012 QCCA 236 (CanLII), at para. 18). The trial judge found that Messrs. Cloutier and Collin were credible witnesses , but held that the fault element (themens rea) of the offences had not been established because the words were not conveyed by the respondent with the intent that they would be transmitted to the subjects of the threats in an attempt to influence their actions (paras. 14-15).",

On the evening of December 28, 2009, Mr. MacDonald entertained a co-worker and his co-worker's friend at his Halifax condominium (the \"unit\"). Some alcohol was consumed during the evening as Mr. MacDonald and his colleague — who was about to replace him in Halifax — discussed work. [3]Later in the evening, the concierge of Mr. MacDonald's building, Mr. Sears, received a noise complaint regarding loud music reverberating from the unit. Mr. Sears went to the unit, heard the loud music and knocked on the door. He received no response. Just as he was about to leave, he saw Mr. MacDonald's guests leaving the unit and saying good night. At this point, Mr. Sears asked Mr. MacDonald to turn down his music. Mr. MacDonald, swearing at him, refused to do so. [4]Mr. Sears contacted the Halifax Regional Police and asked them to deal with the complaint about the noise issue. Pierce went to the building and, together with Mr. Sears, approached Mr. MacDonald's unit. Pierce knocked on his door and asked him to turn his music down or off. Mr. MacDonald swore at her and slammed the door shut. [5]Cst. Pierce contacted her supervisor, Sgt. Boyd, who arrived at the building approximately a half hour later. Boyd, Cst. Pierce and Mr. Sears went to the unit. Boyd tried to get Mr. MacDonald to answer the door by knocking on it and kicking it, and also shouted that he was from the Halifax Regional Police.

Boyd noticed something \"black and shiny\" in Mr. MacDonald's right hand that was in a shadow and was partially hidden by his right leg (A.R., at p. 167). He believed it might be a knife. He twice asked Mr. MacDonald what was behind his leg, gesturing toward his right hand. Mr. MacDonald did not respond. [7]Wanting to get a better look at what Mr. MacDonald had in his hand, Sgt. Boyd pushed the door open a few inches further. The resulting light enabled him to identify it as a handgun.",

    "text": "36Notwithstanding the many weaknesses in the evidence given by C., the trial judge found C. to be a credible witness. According to the trial judge, C.'s \"impreciseness respecting dates\" did not \"lessen his credibility\" (p. 298). In addition, the trial judge found that C.'s past dishonesty did not bring C.'s credibility into question. As a result, the trial judge accepted C.'s evidence and found it to corroborate the evidence of E. in respect of the \"ointment incident\". The accused was therefore convicted of having indecently assaulted both complainants. It is significant that the trial judge was not prepared to accept E.'s evidence except in respect of the one incident which was, in her view, corroborated by C. 37In my view, the obvious inconsistencies and falsehoods in the testimony of C. render the trial judge's finding of credibility unreasonable. I simply cannot accept that any trier of fact, acting judicially, could have found any merit in the claims of either C. or E. Moreover, given the frailties in the evidence of these two witnesses and the strong possibility of collusion, reliance by the trial judge on the evidence of C. to corroborate E.'s testimony was unreasonable. 38In finding that there was no collaboration between the complainants C. and E., the trial judge stressed the fact that C. had never had access to the newspaper reports in which E.'s statements had appeared. Because there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that C. had learned the details of E.'s allegations through the media, the trial judge held that C.'s account of abuse had not been tainted by prior knowledge of the statements made by E. With respect, this ignores the possibility that C. may have learned the details of E.'s story through contact with their common lawyer, Harry Kopyto. The trial judge appears to have failed to notice that both complainants had been in contact with Kopyto. Without referring to the obvious possibility of contact through a common lawyer, the trial judge took the view that there was \"no evidence that prior to [S.E.] or [D.C.] making their respective complaints to the police there was any contact between the two\" (p. 300).",

    "text": "Clearly, contact between the complainants and Harry Kopyto constitutes evidence of possible contact between the complainants, or at least the possibility that C. was exposed to the details of E.'s allegations. Obviously, this raises a risk or possibility that C.'s claims against the accused arose from his knowledge of the statements made by E. 39There is a considerable body of authority to the effect that when an issue of the possibility of collusion or collaboration is raised, evidence of similar acts should not be admitted absent a finding by the trial judge that there is no real possibility of collusion or collaboration. SeeCross on Evidence(7th ed. 1990), at pp. 364-65, andHoch v. The Queen(1988), 165 C.L.R. 292 (H.C. Austr.). 40InDirector of Public Prosecutions v. Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421 (H.L.), at p. 444, Lord Wilberforce stated that where a real possibility of collusion can be found: ... something much more than mere similarity and absence of proved conspiracy is needed if this evidence is to be allowed. This is well illustrated byReg.v.Kilbourne[1973] A.C. 529 where the judge excluded \"intra group\" evidence because of the possibility,as it appeared to him, of collaboration between boys who knew each other well. This is, in my respectful opinion, the right course rather than to admit the evidence unless a case of collaboration or concoction is made out. [Emphasis in original.] 41As a result of its more recent decisions inDirector of Public Prosecutions v. P., [1991] 2 A.C. 447, andR. v. H., [1995] 2 A.C. 596, the House of Lords is now of the view that, generally, the possibility of collusion is not a factor to be applied by the trial judge in determining the admissibility of this type of evidence. This Court has not decided the question although it was my view in my dissent inR. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, that before similar fact evidence is admitted, the risk of collusion must be negatived by a finding by the trial judge. The majority did not express an opinion on the point. 42The appellant did not contest the mutual admissibility of the evidence of E. and C. in respect of the counts relating to each. It is therefore not appropriate for this Court to attempt to resolve this difficult legal question in this case.",

    "text": "It is therefore not appropriate for this Court to attempt to resolve this difficult legal question in this case. But, assuming the evidence is admissible, the question arises as to what weight, if any, ought to have been given to it as corroborative evidence. 43This question was considered by the House of Lords inR. v. H.,supra. The appellant was charged in separate counts with sexual offences committed upon his adopted daughter and stepdaughter respectively. There existed sufficient similarity between the evidence of the two complainants to meet this requirement for admission as similar act evidence. Admissibility was, however, contested on the ground that a real possibility of collusion existed. The trial judge directed the jury that, if they were sure that the complainants had not collaborated, then the evidence of one of them could corroborate that of the other. The House of Lords dismissed an appeal from a judgment upholding the charge. Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C. stated, at p. 612, that where a question of collusion has been raised the judge must clearly draw the importance of collusion to the attention of the jury and leave it to them to decide whether, notwithstanding such evidence of collusion as may have been put before them, they are satisfied that the evidence can be relied upon as free from collusion and tell them that if they are not so satisfied they cannot properly rely upon it as corroboration or for any other purpose adverse to the defence. 44Lord Lloyd of Berwick and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead agreed with Lord Mackay. Lord Griffiths and Lord Mustill would apparently have left it to the jury to determine what weight, if any, should be given to the evidence. The majority reasons of Lord Mackay would, therefore, leave it to the jury to decide as a preliminary question of fact whether the evidence is tainted by collusion. If the answer is in the affirmative, the evidence must be disregarded. This would in effect leave it to the jury to decide whether the evidence was admissible. While unusual, a similar approach has been approved by this Court in relation to the co-conspirator exceptions to the hearsay rule. SeeR. v. Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938. See alsoR. v.

    "text": "39The second such instance arises when an offender is convicted of a number of distinct counts in relation to a single offence or in relation to a set of different offences. In such situations, s. 717(4)(c) of theCodeempowers a trial judge to order that certain numerical sentences be served consecutively as opposed to concurrently. In the presence of such an order, an offender could quite easily be forced to serve a cumulative fixed-term sentence well beyond 14 years, depending on the number of counts and the maximum sentence associated with each count. But once again, theCodefalls silent as to whether or not there is an upper limit on cumulative sentences in our criminal law. 40In both such circumstances, notwithstanding the lack of any explicit statutory ceiling on numerical sentences, Canadian courts have generally refrained from exploring whether there is indeed a limit on fixed-term sentences under theCode. Rather, guided by the legal obligation that a term of imprisonment be \"just and appropriate\" under the circumstances, courts have generally avoided imposing excessively harsh and onerous sentences which might test the potential legal ceilings governing the imposition of sentence. It is a well-established tenet of our criminal law that the quantum of sentence imposed should be broadly commensurate with the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. As Wilson J. expressed in her concurring judgment inRe B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 533: It is basic to any theory of punishment that the sentence imposed bear some relationship to the offence; it must be a \"fit\" sentence proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Only if this is so can the public be satisfied that the offender \"deserved\" the punishment he received and feel a confidence in the fairness and rationality of the system. Cory J. similarly acknowledged the importance of \"the principle of proportionality\" in speaking for the Court inR.v.M. (J.J.), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 421, at p. 431, noting that \"[i]t is true that for both adults and minors the sentence must be proportional to the offence committed\". Indeed, the principle of proportionality in punishment is fundamentally connected to the general principle of criminal liability which holds that the criminal sanction may only be imposed on those actors who possess a morally culpable state of mind.",

    "text": "Indeed, the principle of proportionality in punishment is fundamentally connected to the general principle of criminal liability which holds that the criminal sanction may only be imposed on those actors who possess a morally culpable state of mind. In discussing the constitutional requirement of fault for murder inR.v.Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 645, I noted the related principle that \"punishment must be proportionate to the moral blameworthiness of the offender\", and that \"those causing harm intentionally [should] be punished more severely than those causing harm unintentionally\". On the principle of proportionality generally, seeR. v. Wilmott, [1967] 1 C.C.C. 171, at pp. 178-79 (Ont. C.A.);Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach,supra, at p. 154. 41Within broader parameters, the principle of proportionality expresses itself as a constitutional obligation. As this Court has recognized on numerous occasions, a legislative or judicial sentence that is grossly disproportionate, in the sense that it is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency, will violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment unders. 12of theCharter. SeeSmith,supra, at p. 1072;R.v.Luxton, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711, at p. 724;R.v.Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, at pp. 498-99. However, as I noted inSmith, at p. 1072, \"[w]e should be careful not to stigmatize every disproportionate or excessive sentence as being a constitutional violation\", and thus the review of the proportionality of sentences should normally be left to the \"usual sentencing appeal process\" directed at the fitness of sentence. 42In the context of consecutive sentences, this general principle of proportionality expresses itself through the more particular form of the \"totality principle\". The totality principle, in short, requires a sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for multiple offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender. Thomas describes the principle inPrinciples of Sentencing(2nd ed. 1979), at p. 56: The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is \"just and appropriate\".

A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of a sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender \"a crushing sentence\" not in keeping with his record and prospects. 43Whether under the rubric of the \"totality principle\" or a more generalized principle of proportionality, Canadian courts have been reluctant to impose single and consecutive fixed-term sentences beyond 20 years. See M. Rice, \"Fixed-Term Sentences of More Than 20 Years Versus Life Imprisonment\" (1994), 36Crim. L.Q.474, at p. 474, n. 1. As Rice has noted, as a matter of practice, provincial courts of appeal have only been willing to sustain sentences in excess of 20 years on rare occasions. See, e.g.,R.v.Saumer, [1977] 3 W.W.R. 385 (B.C.C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 25 years for robbery);R.v.Nichols(1978), 9 A.R. 203 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 27 years for robbery);R.v.Belmas, Hansen and Taylor(1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 142 (B.C.C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 22 years for terrorist activities);R.v.Gorham(1987), 22 O.A.C. 237 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 23 years for robbery and firearms);R.v.Currie(1990), 98 N.S.R. (2d) 287 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 26 years for robbery and sexual assault);Yazdaniv. La Reine,[1992] R.J.Q. 2385 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 25 years for heroin importation). More commonly, sentences in excess of 20 years imposed at trial have been reduced to beneath 20 years on appeal, often through reference to the principle of totality. See, e.g.,R.v.Velmurugu(1994), 74 O.A.C. 393 (C.A.);R.v.Parsons(1993), 24 C.R. (4th) 112 (Ont. C.A.);R.v.Pelletier(1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 340 (Que. C.A.);R.v.Charest(1989), 30 Q.A.C. 227;R.v.Childs(1984), 52 N.B.R. (2d) 9 (C.A.). 44In contrast to the absence of any explicit codal rules governing the limits on fixed-term sentences of imprisonment, theCriminal Code, read together with theCorrections Act, sets very clear rules governing the determination of parole eligibility. A person sentenced to a numerical term of imprisonment under theCode(i.e., not life) becomes eligible for full parole after serving the lesser of one third of the sentence or seven years.",

Death was caused by three stab wounds to the upper part of the stomach, any one of which would have been fatal. The deceased had a blood alcohol level of 293 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.

The respondent then went to the kitchen, returned with a bread knife and was standing with the knife in his right hand. The respondent remembered stabbing the deceased two times and pushing him back into his chair. 5The stabbing was witnessed by two other individuals. One of these witnesses, a self-described panhandler and street person of no fixed address, testified that both the deceased and the respondent had been drinking and that the respondent was very drunk. At some point, the deceased told another individual present to \"get rid of your two friends\" and the respondent then hit the deceased on the head with a rock.

The charges arose from a severe beating which occurred in the early hours of October 21, 1992, in an area behind a YWCA in downtown Calgary. The deceased was found lying on his back in a pool of blood. He had suffered severe facial lacerations; in fact, the deceased's face was so mutilated that the emergency medical technician was unable at first to tell whether the victim was a man or a woman. The deceased died some time later in the hospital. (i)Evidence of the Assault 4The main Crown witness, Art Collins, testified that in the early morning of October 21, 1992, he stopped at a set of traffic lights by the Cecil Hotel. He saw three men cross the street. The men appeared to be arguing. Collins felt there was going to be a confrontation so he parked his vehicle in the hotel parking lot and went across the street to the park beside the YWCA. At trial he estimated that he was about 30 feet away from the three men. He testified that the lighting was not too bad and that he had a pretty clear view. 5He saw two men assaulting another individual. Both of the men were kicking and hitting the victim. Collins told them to stop, which they did momentarily, but then continued the beating. The taller of the assailants appeared to be kicking the victim in the head while the shorter one kicked him in the body. Before they moved off, the shorter one was on his knees hitting the victim with his fists. Collins testified that he could see the kicking and punching very clearly. The taller assailant had long dark hair. The shorter one had what appeared to be a black jacket with a long T-shirt hanging below it. In court, Collins misidentified Harley McMaster as the taller of the two assailants. 6Collins went to a cab parked by the hotel and asked the driver to call the police.",

The driver moved his vehicle to shine its lights into the park area. The beating stopped at this point. The two assailants proceeded out the gate to the park, leaving the victim on the ground. The police arrived almost immediately and Collins pointed out, to the police, the assailants, who were moving away from the scene. 7Godfrey Daniell, the cab driver, testified that while he was parked at the Cecil Hotel, he was approached by a man about the disturbance which had been going on across the street. Daniell called the police first. At some point, he moved his vehicle across the street to get his headlights onto the courtyard where the disturbance was taking place. He saw people beating on a person on the ground but could not say how many individuals were involved. Although there was some light in the area, the darkness prevented Daniell from seeing too many details. 8Daniell saw two people walk away from the scene. The shorter of the assailants had an undershirt or T-shirt hanging down. They both seemed to have dark hair and dark features. Daniell thought that the one with the longest hair was a woman. After the police arrived at the scene, he got into his cab and drove to a library where he thought the assailants would be. He saw them proceeding at a steady pace. He followed them until he saw a police van and attempted to get the attention of one of the officers. The officers then apprehended the appellants. 9Sergeant Sembo of the Calgary police was the first officer to arrive at the scene. As he approached, he observed two individuals leaving the YWCA courtyard. There was no one else on the street. He radioed their description to all downtown units. He described them as two native Canadians, one smaller than the other, the smaller possibly a female. Sembo thought that the larger individual wore a dark black leather jacket and had long thick black hair. 10According to Sembo, the area where the victim was found was darker than the street but one could see without a flashlight.",

A serologist testified that human blood was found on the boots, blue jeans, socks, shirt and jacket of Randy McMaster and it was consistent with the standard obtained from the deceased. Blood found on a running shoe worn by Harley McMaster was also consistent with having come from the deceased. 14The hair and fibre expert also testified that he found 18 hairs on a piece of concrete block found at the scene and 16 hairs on another block. According to the serologist, blood consistent with that of the victim was found on these two pieces of concrete block. (iii)The Evidence of Intoxication 15Collins testified that when he first saw the assailants crossing the street the tallest assailant took a drink out of a bottle. Daniell testified that when the assailants left the scene, they walked with a bit of a stagger. 16Constable Koenen testified that when he arrested Harley McMaster, he was very cooperative when read his rights and appeared to understand what the officer had read to him.",

At about 7:45, after helping Timothy Lemky to install some wall panelling in the living room, the group began drinking from a 40 oz. bottle of Gibson's whisky \"with a drink or two\" out of it which Daniel Valachy had brought along with him. Heidi Lemky and Mike Glover left at about 8:00 p.m. By 9:30, the entire bottle had been consumed, mainly by Timothy Lemky and Daniel Valachy. Shortly before ten, Timothy Lemky and Michelle Cummins left the house together and went to a local Oktoberfest dance. An hour or so later, the couple left the dance and returned home. Shortly before eleven o'clock, Lemky telephoned his mother, told her that Michelle Cummins was dead, and asked her to call the police. At 11:04, he himself called the police. He said, \"My name is Randy Lemky and there has been a manslaughter here.\" Asked whether he was involved, he said, \"Yes, I am. I am the one to blame. Yes, I am.\" He told the operator that he had used a 30.30 rifle and said, \"It was an accident.\" He went on to say, \"I just meant to make a point.\" As the call was taking place, the police arrived at the house. Lemky walked out the front door and said, \"It's all over. It's all over. Nothing will bring her back.\" 3Later, at the police station, Lemky volunteered this comment: We were arguing, we had done this before, and I just went and got my rifle and there was a bullet in it, I didn't think it was loaded, and it went off. I went and tried to help her. I couldn't do anything for her. After taking breathalyzer tests, the police took a further statement at 11:49, in which Lemky gave a complete account of the killing. After describing the argument, he said: So, we argued and we .. I had done as much as I could do, physically trying to make the point. I reached up on the wall and I took the rifle down. The rifle was a game, the rifle was a toy, it meant nothing. All of a sudden, I was playing with the rifle.",

My girlfriend was there, and the gun went off. Next thing I knew, I was grasping her in my arms and the blood was, the blood was coming out .. and I was crying and I was screaming for help. The next day at 1:07 p.m., the appellant gave a second exculpatory statement, this time explaining that the gun had been accidentally knocked to the floor and went off accidentally as he was trying to pick it up. There was evidence that the rifle was, as a matter of course, kept loaded in the bedroom. 4The evidence on the appellant's state of inebriation before the shooting was conflicting. Some saw him as loud and obnoxious at the dance. The bartender at the dance served Lemky some beer and noticed that \"he had had a few drinks before that\". Another witness testified that the appellant showed no signs of intoxication, and seemed \"very straight\". At 11:03, immediately after the shooting, the police noted alcohol on his breath and that his eyes were watery and bloodshot. The breathalyzer test taken about three-quarters of an hour later showed a reading of 130 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. When asked about his consumption of alcohol that evening in the course of his initial interview with the police following the shooting, Lemky responded that he had consumed about one-half of the bottle of whisky brought by Valachy, followed by about three more drinks at the dance, and said, \"Oh, uh, I had quite a bit to drink.\"",

When Mr. Crispin emerged from his car to help the motorist, the appellant and two accomplices waylaid the good Samaritan and forced him back into his Lincoln Continental. The appellant and his accomplices (Vince and Racky) were in possession of a shotgun, which they used to force Mr. Crispin to comply with their demands. Witnesses in the area heard Mr. Crispin cry \"No gun, I want to live\". As the appellant and his accomplices drove Mr. Crispin away in the Continental, witnesses could hear the sound of a gunshot fired within the car. 4Approximately one hour after accosting Mr. Crispin, the appellant and his cohorts attempted several bank transactions at an automated teller using Mr. Crispin's card. The appellant and his friends withdrew $200 from Crispin's account, indicating that they had somehow obtained Crispin's personal banking number. 5At approximately 5:00 a.m., Constable Vandenburg of the Durham Regional Police observed the appellant and his accomplices at a convenience store in Whitby. Crispin's Lincoln Continental was idling in the parking lot of the store. Constable Vandenburg observed the appellant and his friends for several minutes, watching them eventually drive away. 6After following the Continental for a brief period, Constable Vandenburg finally stopped the appellant and his companions. The appellant was driving the vehicle, and produced identification at the request of Constable Vandenburg. The identification in question was that of Michael Crispin, the man who had just been killed by the appellant and his cohorts. Constable Vandenburg examined the identification produced by the appellant, and asked the appellant to state his name. The appellant replied that his name was \"Christopher\". The name on the identification given to Constable Vandenburg was \"Michael\". Constable Vandenburg, suspecting that something was afoot, escorted the appellant to the police cruiser and asked him several questions. 7Based on the appellant's answers to his inquiries, Constable Vandenburg arrested the appellant for possession of stolen property. The constable searched the appellant and discovered live shotgun ammunition on his person. 8With the assistance of a back-up unit, Constable Vandenburg returned to the Lincoln Continental and arrested the appellant's cohorts, Vince and Racky.",

When the Continental was searched, the police discovered a loaded sawed-off shotgun beneath the passenger seat in the front of the car. 9At approximately 6:55 a.m., the appellant and his accomplices were escorted to a police station where the appellant was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon and obstructing the police. The appellant denied any knowledge of Michael Crispin, and claimed that he had obtained Crispin's vehicle from \"[t]he guy at the Parkdale Hotel\". When questioned about the live shotgun shells in his possession, the appellant offered no explanation aside from the fact that the shells \"weren't in the gun\". 10Michael Crispin's body was eventually discovered on March 11, 1985. His corpse was found in an isolated area in Durham. A scarf had been used to \"gag\" Mr. Crispin, who had a gaping head wound consistent with a point-blank shotgun blast. 11The appellant's coat was subjected to forensic examination, which revealed five specks of tissue which were consistent with the body of the deceased. In addition, the legs of the appellant's pants were found to be wet, as if the appellant had been walking in an area covered with snow such as the one in which Mr. Crispin's body was found. One of the appellant's cohorts (Mr. Vince) eventually confessed to having fired the fatal shot into Crispin's head. 12Because the appellant was a party to the offences of unlawful confinement and robbery which led to the death of Mr. Crispin, the appellant was clearly guilty of \"constructive murder\" or \"felony murder\" unders. 213(d) of theCriminal Code. The appellant pleaded guilty to the lesser included offence of second degree murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the potential for parole for 15 years.

The appellant D.W. is the boyfriend of H.R., now divorced from D.R. All the appellants are deaf; only D.W. is able to speak. 4The appellants were jointly charged with several counts of sexual assault and gross indecency, and one count of assault, arising out of alleged incidents involving the children between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1989. In this time period the children ranged in age from one to ten. D.R. and H.R. were also charged with incest and several additional counts of assault causing bodily harm. 5D.R. and H.R. were married in 1979 when she was 21 and he was 48. She had a drinking problem, and their relationship was unstable. The couple had difficulty raising their children. The Department of Social Welfare was involved as early as 1983, when the twins were hospitalized because of malnutrition. By 1986, H.R. was spending most of her time away from the home, and began a relationship with D.W. As a result, primary care for the children fell on D.R. His failure to adequately take care of the children led to their placement in the K. foster home in February 1987. At that time, Michael was seven years old and the twins were five. The children had frequent unsupervised visits with D.R. until September 1987. They had only sporadic, supervised visits with H.R. and D.W. 6All three children were observed by Mr. and Mrs. K. to be hyperactive and difficult to control. They appeared to be sexually overt, and were often found kissing and hugging, or naked together in the playroom. Garnet Francis taught Michael from September 1986 to the spring of 1989 in a special class for problem children, and noted his aggressive sexual behaviour that included inappropriate touching of other children, undressing, and inviting other children and staff to have sex with him. Similar observations were made of the twins who later attended the same school. 7In September 1987, the children visited D.R.'s residence for an overnight stay. When they returned to the K. home, Mrs. K. noticed blood stains on Michelle's underwear. When she asked Michelle what had happened, Michelle said that her daddy had \"touched\" her.",

The next day, Mrs. K. took Michelle to Dr. McKenna for a physical examination. Dr. McKenna concluded that Michelle had been subjected to non-accidental trauma of the genital area. Michelle told the doctor that \"my deaf daddy spanked my bum then he put his fingers in my bum, it hurt\". At trial, Michelle was unable to recall anything about the incident. 8By December 12, 1989, Michael's behaviour had deteriorated so badly that the K. family was unable to continue taking care of him. He was removed from the K. home and placed in the foster care of Mr. and Mrs. Some time after his arrival at the T. residence, Michael made allegations that he and his sisters had been sexually abused by the K. family. As a result, the twins were removed to the T. residence on May 29, 1990. On June 5, 1990, all three children were examined by Dr. Yelland who found some medical evidence consistent with sexual abuse. 9Subsequently, the children began making multiple allegations of sexual abuse against their birth parents, D.W., the K. family and many K. family relatives. In addition, the children claimed that while in the care of their birth parents, they had been witness or party to the killing and eating of babies, as well as the eating and drinking of faeces, blood and urine. At that time, the children began treatment with Ms. Carol Bunko-Ruys, a child therapist. 10Sergeant Dueck, a Saskatoon police officer assigned to investigate the allegations, interviewed the children at length in videotaped sessions. The therapist was present at interviews conducted during October and November of 1990. 11Dr. Yelland reexamined the children on May 31, 1991, and found further evidence of injuries that he believed was consistent with the types of physical and sexual abuse alleged by the children. 12Based upon the medical evidence and police investigation, the appellants were charged with sexually and physically abusing the children. Mr. and Mrs. K., and several members of their family, including Mr. K.'s father, Peter K., were separately charged with offences arising out of the alleged sexual assault of the children.",

Thus, while this Court, in theEsquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co.case,supra, held a tax on land essentially based on the market value of the timber thereon to be indirect because of the obvious tendency of the tax to be passed on to the purchasers of the timber, the Privy Council reversed that decision because it was a land tax. So too inCanadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan,supra, the SaskatchewanMineral Taxation Act, 1948, S.S. 1948, c. 24, which imposed a tax on minerals in producing areas of the province at a rate based on the fair market value of the minerals, was held valid as a land tax. Again, inR. v. Churchill(1972), 29 D.L.R. (3d) 368 (B.C.S.C.), McIntyre J., later of this Court, held that a fee imposed on operators of mobile home parks calculated in terms of the number of units in a park was a tax on land and so historically a direct tax. That fee would clearly have a tendency to be passed on to the unit holders. It can scarcely be said, as my colleague does, that these are \"traditional\" land taxes. As in the present case, they are based on specific uses of the land that make it very likely that the taxes will be recouped by the landowner against others. Indeed, in all the cases I have examined, taxes against land or its owner have invariably been held to be direct. This approach was most recently confirmed by this Court inCanadian Industrial Gas & Oil Ltd.,supra. There Dickson J., as he then was, dissenting but on this point speaking for a unanimous Court (see Martland J.'s reasons, at p. 558), had this to say, at p. 583:",

To do so, the accused must show that concerns about autonomy, reliability, and police conduct exist, as they will in nearly every Mr. Big operation. In such circumstances, the burden will shift to the Crown to establish that there is no breach. Consequently, the Crown should always be prepared to demonstrate the admissibility of the resulting evidence. This will encourage the police to give careful consideration to the constitutionality of the operation and will incentivize recording of the Mr. Big \"scenarios\" where possible. Given that the entire operation, not just the final meeting, is relevant to the admissibility of any evidence obtained, thorough records would make it easier for the court to assess the investigation and would allow the police to defend against allegations of undue coercion or state misconduct. [185]The principle against self-incrimination also works to secure trial fairness, which is a principle of fundamental justice recognized underss. 7and11(d)of theCharter. Trial fairness may be compromised whenever there are concerns about how police have obtained self-incriminating evidence, where such evidence is of dubious reliability, and where juries have difficulty evaluating the truthfulness of confessions.

The order was sought on the basis of the nature of the evidence, which the court had not yet heard, and which purportedly established that the offence was of a\"very delicate\"nature. Crown counsel further pointed to the fact that the case involved young, female persons. 3. André Veniot, a CBC reporter, was excluded from the court along with the other members of the media and the public. Shortly after the public had been invited to reattend the proceedings, a lawyer retained by Veniot was granted permission to address the court. She requested that Rice Prov. Ct. J. give reasons for making the exclusion order. In maintaining his order, Rice Prov. Ct. J. stated that it had been rendered in the interests of the proper administration of justice; it would avoid undue hardship to the victims and the accused.",

    "text": "[19]Scott C.J.M. proposed the following approach for determining whether a given threat amounts to an attempted use of violence : [S]ome degree of physical action must be part of a threat for it to constitute the \"attempted use of violence\". That is, there needs to be some indication of imminent apparent danger to a person or some overt act directed towards the actual use of violence against a person for a threat of violence to also constitute the attempted use of violence. [20]Finally, Scott C.J.M. noted that McKelvey J.'s findings of fact had not been challenged, and because the threat of violence was not associated with either imminent danger or \"any, even minimal, overt physical act\", he upheld the trial judge's decision . The threat, while sufficient to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343(a), did not constitute the use or attempted use of violence for the purposes of the definition of an SPIO and did not trigger the sentencing procedures under Part XXIV. IV.Issue [21]Does robbery committed by using threats of violence to a person within the meaning ofs. 343(a) of theCriminal Codeconstitute an SPIO in accordance with subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of that expression set out in s. 752? V.Analysis [22]To determine whether an offence constitutes an SPIO, it is necessary to review the elements of the offence, but it may also be necessary, if that review is insufficient, to consider the factual circumstances in which the offence was committed. Certain offences automatically constitute SPIOs regardless of the manner in which they are committed: s. 752, para. (b) of the definition of \"serious personal injury offence\"; seeR. v. Currie, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260, at paras. 21-22. There are other offences that always constitute SPIOs in that one of their elements automatically satisfies the descriptive criteria set out in para. (a) of the definition of an SPIO. One example would be where personal violence or endangerment forms part of the definition of the offence: see, e.g.,R. v. Cepic,2010 ONSC 561, 93 M.V.R. (5th) 129, at para. 18.",

Robbery is clearly not one of this second type of offences, since it can involve the use of violence or threats of violence to a personor property, whereas subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO refers only to the use or attempted use of violenceagainst another person: seeLebar,at para. 65. [23]Thus, the question is whether a robbery committed as in the instant case — by using threats of violence to a person, but without using actual physical violence — satisfies the criterion of \"use or attempted use of violence against another person\" set out in the definition. I conclude that it does. I reach this conclusion in light of the modern principle of statutory interpretation that the words of legislation must be read \"in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\": Driedger,Construction of Statutes(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87. [24]I will begin by discussing the purpose of the SPIO threshold and its function within the scheme of Part XXIV. I will then consider the plain meaning of the term \"violence\" in the context of theCriminal Codeand other legislation. Finally, I will discuss the statutory context of the provision in which the phrase \"use or attempted use of violence\" appears, including the other provisions of the definition of an SPIO and the provision that defines the offence of robbery. Taken together, these considerations support the view that threats of violence to a person that suffice to ground a conviction for robbery meet the violence criterion in the definition of an SPIO. Because robbery is an indictable offence for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more, all the criteria of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO are satisfied. A.Purpose of the SPIO Requirement [25]The Crown emphasizes that the SPIO requirement serves as a gateway in that it is applied before an offender is assessed for dangerousness and before an application can be made for a finding that he or she is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender.",

    "text": "The \"use or attempted use of violence\" criterion must therefore, the Crown argues, be interpreted broadly to ensure that offenders who might meet the criteria are not excluded from being assessed, which would undermine the goal of public protection. [26]Mr. Steele counters that the SPIO requirement performs an important function in Part XXIV by ensuring that offenders may only be sentenced to indeterminate detention for sufficiently serious crimes. He argues that an overly broad construction of this requirement would frustrate the scheme's objective of proportionality. [27]As I will explain, both these purposive arguments have merit. The general purpose of Part XXIV is public protection, and an overly narrow construction of the gateway provision would indeed undermine this purpose. However, the specific purpose of the SPIO requirement is to link the sentence to the predicate offence, and an overly broad construction would undermine this purpose and jeopardize the objective of proportionality. My interpretive approach must be sensitive to both the general and the specific purpose. I will now discuss each of these purposes in detail and will conclude that the seriousness requirement of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO is satisfied by a textual and contextual interpretation of the words \"use or attempted use of violence\", and that it would be wrong to read in an objective minimum level of violence. (1)General Purpose of the Dangerous and Long-term Offender Provisions [28]Part XXIV of theCriminal Codeauthorizes the indeterminate detention of individuals who are found to be \"dangerous offender[s]\" on the basis that their past conduct and patterns of behaviour show that they constitute a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons (s. 753(1)(a)), or that their failure to control sexual impulses means that they are likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to other persons (s. 753(1)(b)). It also authorizes the long-term supervision of individuals who are found to be \"long-term offender[s]\" where a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more would be appropriate, there is a substantial risk that the individuals will reoffend, and there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of that risk in the community (s. 753.1(1)).",

The appellant was physically abusive towards Seymour, and the couple were separated just before Michael's third birthday. Later that year, the appellant underwent a religious conversion and took up residence in a religious community at Clark's Harbour, Nova Scotia. Although Michael originally remained with his mother, she became unable to care for him, and, in December 1986, Seymour agreed that Michael should live with the appellant. It was also agreed that the appellant would be solely responsible for Michael's upbringing. In August 1987, the appellant and Michael moved to an affiliated religious community located on the Myrtle Tree Farm at Waterville, Nova Scotia. 3Near the end of 1987, Michael was taken from his father by provincial officials acting under an order of the Family Court of Nova Scotia, on the ground that he was a \"child in need of protection\" within the meaning of theChildren's Services Act, S.N.S. 1976, c. 8. Lengthy court proceedings ensued, at the conclusion of which the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that the Family Court's order wasultra viresand ordered that Michael be returned to his father. 4Over the next few years, Seymour became dissatisfied with the limitations which the appellant was placing on her access to Michael, and, in 1992, she applied to the Family Court for custody and access.

The robber took about $230 and left the store. The robber's face was not covered, but he was wearing something on his head. Mr. Wahabzada described the robber to police as hefty with a strong build, blond hair and a mustache. He said that his own height was 175 centimetres and that the robber was taller than that. 40A few days after the robbery, Mr. Wahabzada was shown a series of photographs by police in an album containing 12 colour photographs. Two police officers testified about Mr. Wahabzada's comments in response to the photographs. They attributed varying degrees of certainty to his choice of photograph number 6, which was conceded to have been a photograph of the respondent, as a photograph of the man who robbed him. According to the officers, Mr. Wahabzada said, \"that's him\", or \"He looks just like him\", when pointing to number 6, but also said, \"He looks a bit like him also\", referring to number 8. This evidence was at variance with the evidence of Mr. Wahabzada who stated that he suspected photographs number 6, 8 and 11, but that he could be no more than 25 or 30 percent sure that any of them was the robber. He was more sure that it was number 8 than the other two. Number 6 was conceded to be a photograph of the respondent. The evidence at trial was, in part, as follows: I'm showing you an album, as you called it, having twelve pictures in it. Is this what you were shown by the officers? All right. And were you able to recognize anyone, sir? I suspect this man -- and either this one or this one -- I think this one. All right. Do you remember what you said? Yeah, I say that I suspect only twenty-five percent or thirty percent, no more than that. On which one?",

    "text": "3The appellant, Mr. Latimer, was the father of Tracy Latimer, a severely disabled child who died at her family farm on Sunday, October 24, 1993. Tracy suffered from extreme cerebral palsy and was quadriplegic. As a result of her physical condition, she was largely immobile and bedridden, and was physically unable to take care of herself. Her family provided her with constant care. Eating was a difficult task, and Tracy had to be spoon fed. Unfortunately, even with this assistance, she could not consume a sufficient amount of nutrients, and as a result experienced weight loss. 4It is undisputed that Tracy was in constant pain. The evidence traces this pain to an operation that Tracy underwent in 1990 to balance the muscles around her pelvis, and another operation in 1992 to reduce the abnormal curvature in her back. Although the latter surgery was successful, it led to the dislocation of her right hip, which caused considerable discomfort. As well, despite the administration of medication, Tracy experienced five to six seizures every day. 5Tracy was in the care of Mr. Latimer when she passed away. The appellant had remained home to care for Tracy, while Tracy's mother and siblings were at church to attend a Sunday service. Tracy was found by Mrs. Latimer at approximately 1:30 p.m., when she went to get Tracy for lunch. At 2:00 p.m., Mr. Latimer advised the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP by telephone that Tracy had passed away in her sleep. The RCMP officer who took the call and the local coroner attended at the Latimer farm. While at the farm, the coroner examined Tracy's body in order to determine the cause of death. Finding no evidence to suggest suffocation, the coroner arranged for an autopsy. During the visit to the farm, Mr. Latimer maintained that Tracy had passed away in her sleep. He stated that Tracy had been in pain and put to bed at about 12:30 p.m. 6The autopsy found no signs that would explain Tracy's death, but found signs consistent with poisoning. Samples of Tracy's blood were therefore sent to a forensic laboratory for further analysis. Tests indicated that Tracy's blood was saturated with carbon monoxide.",

Because of the high levels of carbon monoxide in Tracy's blood, the RCMP began to treat the matter as a homicide investigation. 7The members of the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP inferred the possibility of motive and opportunity from the facts before them — the appellant was alone with Tracy at the time of her death, and Tracy was bedridden and in constant pain. They then decided to seek the assistance of the General Investigation Section at North Battleford, representatives of which they met with on Wednesday, November 3, 1993. As a result of that meeting, members of the North Battleford detachment decided to attend at the Latimer farm, take Mr. Latimer into custody, interview his wife and execute a search warrant. 8This plan was put into effect the next day, on Thursday, November 4, 1993. The events are described in the uncontradicted testimony of one of the principal investigators, Corporal Lyons, which is quoted in the trial judgment. Important portions of that testimony, which are central to the disposition of this appeal, are underlined for emphasis: At 8:28 that morning, Sergeant Conlon and I went to the residence. . . .

We shook hands. Sergeant Conlon told him that we were from North Battleford and were assisting Wilkie in the investigation of Tracy's death, being his daughter, and told Mr. Latimer that we'd like to speak to him. He went into a bedroom and got dressed, came out a couple of minutes later. We were waiting in the kitchen. Sergeant Conlon said that we'd like to speak to him outside. There was no response.

    "text": "44While the appellant was not subjected to a body \"cavity\" search, the search conducted went far beyond the typical \"frisk\" search which usually accompanies an arrest. Sergeant Kennedy passed his gloved hand through the appellant's hair to remove some hair, combed some more out, and clipped and pulled out still more. The appellant was then made to pull hair from his own pubic area. A dentist was called in to take the appellant's teeth impressions and buccal swabs. All this was without the appellant's consent and despite his protests. The dental procedure involved the placing of several instruments and various substances into the appellant's mouth. As well, photographs and a video were taken of his mouth. The whole procedure took two hours. 45Counsel for the respondent argued that the taking of dental impressions was analogous to the routine practice of fingerprinting. The case ofR. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, was cited as support for the proposition that the common law allowed for the use of such identification procedures upon arrest. In that case, La Forest J. noted that the reduced privacy expectation upon arrest justifies the fingerprinting. However, he added this important qualification at p. 413: While some may find [fingerprinting] distasteful, it is insubstantial, of very short duration, and leaves no lasting impression. There is no penetration into the body and no substance is removed from it. 46How very different is the making of dental impressions. It is a lengthy and highly intrusive process. Further, the taking of the scalp and pubic hair samples involved the forceful removal of hair from the body over the specific objections of the accused. Significantly, inR. v. Borden, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145, it was found that where there is no statutory authorization for the seizure of bodily samples, consent must be obtained if the seizure is to be lawful. Here the police knew they were dealing with a young offender. They were aware that theYoung Offenders Actrequired that a parent or counsel should be present when a suspected young offender was being interviewed. Nonetheless, in the absence of any adult counsellor and contrary to the specific instruction of his lawyers, the police interviewed the appellant at length and by threat of force took bodily samples and dental impressions.",

This was the abusive exercise of raw physical authority by the police. 47No matter what may be the pressing temptations to obtain evidence from a person the police believe to be guilty of a terrible crime, and no matter what the past frustrations to their investigations, the police authority to search as an incident to arrest should not be exceeded. Any other conclusion could all too easily lead to police abuses in the name of the good of society as perceived by the officers. When they are carrying out their duties as highly respected and admired agents of the state they must respect the dignity and bodily integrity of all who are arrested. The treatment meted out by agents of the state to even the least deserving individual will often indicate the treatment that all citizens of the state may ultimately expect. Appropriate limits to the power of search incidental to arrest must be accepted and respected. 48The power to search and seize incidental to arrest was a pragmatic extension to the power of arrest. Obviously the police must be able to protect themselves from attack by the accused who has weapons concealed on his person or close at hand. The police must be able to collect and preserve evidence located at the site of the arrest or in a nearby motor vehicle. As Rice J.A. put it in his dissenting reasons (at p. 360 N.B.R.): The power to search and seize incidental to an arrest is predicated on pragmatic and exigent considerations inherent to the circumstances of an arrest. 49The common law power cannot be so broad as to empower police officers to seize bodily samples. They are usually in no danger of disappearing. Here, there was no likelihood that the appellant's teeth impressions would change, nor that his hair follicles would present a different DNA profile with the passage of time. There was simply no possibility of the evidence sought being destroyed if it was not seized immediately.

The common law power of search incidental to arrest cannot be so broad as to encompass the seizure without valid statutory authority of bodily samples in the face of a refusal to provide them. If it is, then the common law rule itself is unreasonable, since it is too broad and fails to properly balance the competing rights involved. 50It is clear that the appellant's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was very seriously violated. Since the search and seizure of the bodily samples was not authorized by either statutory or common law it could not have been reasonable. It is thus unnecessary to consider either the reasonableness of the law or the manner in which the search was conducted. (b)Did the Taking of the Hair Samples, Teeth Impressions and Buccal Swabs Contravene Section 7 of theCharter? 51The taking of the dental impressions, hair samples and buccal swabs from the accused also contravened the appellant'ss. 7Charterright to security of the person. The taking of the bodily samples was highly intrusive. It violated the sanctity of the body which is essential to the maintenance of human dignity. It was the ultimate invasion of the appellant's privacy. SeePohoretsky,supra.

One of the issues on appeal was whether the trial judge had erred by instructing the jury to consider that the perpetrator was one of the deceased's partners because the eyewitness described the killer's entry into the office as though it were made with a key. In a judgment upholding the conviction, later affirmed by this Court, Middleton J.A. asserted at p. 36: It may be that the evidence is very largely circumstantial, but the actual facts are known to the accused, and he has the right, under the laws as they now exist, to explain them away by his own evidence. For example, he is not directly shown to have been in possession of his gun at the time of the murder. He was in possession of it at an earlier date. It may have been a mere coincidence that the victim was shot by this gun, and that the accused was at the time of the murder only a few yards away. It is possible that the gun had been stolen from his residence by the murderer. If so, he could have testified to the fact, and the jury might have accepted his explanation. He might have been able to explain how the cartridge, which apparently fell from the revolver while he was in the room, came to be there. He may have a satisfactory explanation as to how blood-stained overalls came to be found in his room. He might be able to deny that he made the compromising statements to the gaol inmates, and the jury might readily have believed that the stories told were incredible; but, notwithstanding all the damning chain of evidence, he chooses to maintain silence. No comment may be made upon this to the jury, but the law does not forbid jurors to use their intelligence and to consider the absence of denial or explanation. 7None of these early cases suggests that the accused should be compelled to testify or that the accused is anything other than presumed innocent until proven guilty.",

The first offence occurred in 1986 when the appellant was 29 years of age. The complainant was then a 16-year-old ward of the Alberta government and had been placed in the appellant's home by Social Services. Approximately two weeks after her arrival in the appellant's home, the complainant was asleep on the living room couch, lying on her back. The appellant came home intoxicated. He undid the complainant's pants, at which point the complainant turned over on her stomach and tried to press herself into the couch. She testified that she did so in the hope that perhaps he would go away if he thought she were sleeping. He did not. Instead, he took off her jeans and started to kiss her buttock area. She was trying to pretend that she was sleeping. Then he penetrated her vagina with his penis. She described the degree of penetration as being \"a little bit\" since she had her legs pressed together and he was trying to get them apart. Finally, he said \"You're too difficult\" and rolled onto the floor. He tried to put the complainant's jeans back on. The complainant waited until she was sure that the appellant was asleep on the floor and then she went downstairs to her room. At no time did the complainant consent to the appellant's actions. 4The second offence occurred in 1993 when the appellant was 36 years of age. The complainant was a 14-year-old babysitter for the appellant's family. She had fallen asleep on her stomach on a hide-a-bed while babysitting. She testified that when she had gone to bed, she had been wearing a T-shirt, underwear and had a sleeping bag wrapped around her. When she awoke at 3:30 a.m., her underwear was pulled down and the sleeping bag was around her feet. The appellant was on top of her, rubbing her back under her T-shirt with one hand and rubbing her buttocks with the other. He then reached under her stomach touching her pelvis and vaginal areas. The appellant was trying to turn her over onto her stomach. He did not touch her breasts. She screamed and fled from the residence. 5The appellant pleaded guilty to the two offences.",

He had died following a fierce attack involving five blows to the head, each of sufficient force to kill him, with an iron bar or similar object. While the exact time of death could not be ascertained, he was last seen alive the previous evening. The officer in charge of the investigation noted that blood was spattered everywhere at the Boyle residence, and noted also Sportsman brand cigarettes at the scene. 7. As a result of information provided by several bystanders, the three investigating officers went to the scene of a motor vehicle accident, which involved the deceased's red Datsun pickup truck, about half a kilometre west of the Boyle residence. Two local residents, Kelly Spurn and Cindy Potter, offered new information to the police. Cindy Potter told the police that she had seen Boyle's truck in the ditch at 6:45 that morning. Furthermore, she stated that she had seen someone she identified as Michael walking in an easterly direction along Cedar Creek Road a few minutes earlier with a beer or a coffee cup in his hand. The officer in charge testified that Kelly Spurn told him that the appellant was living on Spurn's property which he was renting out to the appellant's sister, Angela Feeney, and her spouse equivalent, Dale Russell. Spurn suggested that the police go and speak to Russell. Spurn testified that he had told the police that he assumed it was the appellant who had crashed the pickup truck because the skid marks and the location of the accident were in the same place as skid marks from another accident earlier that morning which had involved the appellant and a blue flatbed truck. 8. Upon arrival at the Spurn property where Dale Russell, Angela Feeney and the appellant were living, Russell told police that the appellant had stolen a truck from the Spurn property earlier that morning and that he found it just down from Boyle's residence, exactly where Boyle's truck was found later. He also said that the appellant had come home at 7:00 a.m. after a night of drinking and was now asleep in the trailer behind his residence. 9.",

Receiving no answer, he entered the trailer with his gun drawn and pointing downward, went to the appellant's bed, shook the appellant's leg and said \"I want to talk to you.\" The officer then asked the appellant to get out of bed and move into the better light at the front of the trailer. The officer stated in evidence that he did so in order to inspect the appellant's clothes for bloodstains. The officer conceded that he may have touched the appellant in leading him to the door. The officer noticed blood spattered all over the front of the appellant and had another officer read the appellant his rights in these terms ((1995), 54 B.C.A.C. 228, at p. 230): It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.

The officer in charge immediately asked the appellant how he got blood on himself, to which the appellant replied that he had been hit in the face with a baseball the day before. When asked whether a particular pair of shoes were the shoes he had worn the previous evening, the appellant replied that they were the only shoes he owned.

    "text": "2The respondent, Robert Currie, was charged with three counts of sexual assault, for a series of related incidents in which he sexually touched a number of young girls on November 5, 1988 in a Towers department store in Barrie, Ontario. During the first incident, the respondent approached a group of four girls in the Towers toy section, felt and squeezed the buttocks of three of them, and left the area. During the second, more invasive incident, the respondent followed a group of three sisters near the store's tobacco department. At first, he placed his hand on the eldest girl's breast. Immediately thereafter, he approached the girls from behind and, as the trial judge described, \"swept his hand between the legs of two of them in an attempt to touch their genitals\". The frightened girls notified store employees and security personnel who eventually apprehended the respondent outside the store and awaited the arrival of the police. 3The respondent was convicted of all charges on April 12, 1989 before Tobias J. Prior to sentencing, the Attorney General for Ontario initiated dangerous offender proceedings pursuant tos. 753(b) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. Section 753(b) essentially provides that the Crown may apply to have an offender declared a \"dangerous offender\" and sentenced to an indefinite term of imprisonment if: (a) he has been convicted of a \"serious personal injury offence\"; and (b) his failure to control his sexual impulses reveals \"a likelihood of his causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons\" in the future. A \"serious personal injury offence\" is defined ins. 752of theCriminal Codeto include all forms of sexual assault. 4These sexual assaults were not isolated incidents. Part of the rationale for seeking to have the respondent declared a dangerous offender was his lengthy history of sexual offences that occurred in the Ottawa, Toronto and Hamilton regions between 1975-1988. As outlined in disturbing detail in the judgments below and in the pleadings filed before this Court, the respondent had been previously convicted of numerous sexual offences, some of which were extremely violent and highly degrading to the victims. 5Robert Currie's criminal sexual activity began in and around Ottawa between September and November 1975. In separate incidents, the respondent stalked and sexually attacked four women.",

    "text": "In separate incidents, the respondent stalked and sexually attacked four women. All four of the incidents were serious and frightening for the victims, but two were comparatively more severe. On September 30, 1975, the respondent followed a teenage girl into a field. He caught her, undressed her and forced her to perform fellatio and engage in repeated acts of sexual intercourse. When she resisted he pulled her hair and struck her in the face. On November 29, 1975, later on the same night that he had indecently assaulted another victim, the respondent stalked a young woman in Nepean. After approaching her from behind and striking her to the ground, he forced her into the deep snow of a deserted field. He then undressed his victim completely, repeatedly struck her in the face, forced her to perform fellatio, and forced her to submit to multiple acts of anal and vaginal intercourse. He had a hunting knife in his possession during the rape with which he threatened the victim after the attack. She was bleeding heavily when he abandoned her naked in the snow. 6As a result of these attacks, on May 20, 1976, the respondent was convicted of indecent assault, rape, and possession of a weapon and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Since that time, whenever he was at large, his sexually impulsive criminal behaviour continued. In 1979, while on parole in Toronto, the respondent stalked and attacked a woman. When she screamed in response to his attempt to touch her genitals, he jammed his fingers into her mouth, pushed her to the ground and kicked her. He fled the scene, but was immediately apprehended by police and subsequently convicted of indecent assault. In Hamilton in 1981 and 1982, while under intensive police surveillance, the respondent was observed following and stalking a number of women through the city streets. In one case, the girl sensed she was being followed and sought shelter on the porch of a nearby home. In another case, the respondent indecently assaulted a woman he had been following by putting his hand under her clothing between her legs in an effort to touch her genitals. When arrested by police for the latter incident, the respondent stated: It was me I did it. I couldn't help myself. I asked for help before but they released me.",

I guess I figure its just a few seconds of being frightened and its all over and nobody is hurt. A.Psychiatric Evidence 7To substantiate its dangerous offender application, the Crown elicited the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. Angus McDonald, who participated in a two-month team assessment of the respondent after the commission of the recent Towers department store sexual assaults -- the so-called \"predicate offences\". Dr. McDonald evaluated the respondent as an obsessed and extremely temperamental \"sexual deviate\" who had a \"biological anomaly in the wiring of his brain\". As such he was \"a very dangerous person to society\". In making these findings, Dr. McDonald was influenced by the admission the respondent made to a psychometrist at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre in 1989, in which he stated: [The] stuff I was doing in '79, I got rid of that. I don't bruise them now but don't get me wrong. They had better give me sex if I want it because I often have a knife and I always have my hands. By way of conclusion, Dr. McDonald gave the prognosis that the respondent \"was not open to treatment any longer and posed a risk to women and female children\". 8The defence-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Basil Orchard, acknowledged that the respondent suffered from an impulsive personality disorder and \"a polymorphous sexual deviation\" that includes \"voyeurism, heterosexual pedophilia and hebephilia and impulsive sexual aggressiveness\". Given this diagnosis, he admitted that there was a likelihood that the respondent would re-offend. Dr. Orchard did conclude, however, that the respondent was neither schizophrenic nor psychotic and that he had shown change toward less violent behaviour.",

He prognosticated that if there were future recurrences of the respondent's criminal behaviour, his conduct would tend toward \"nuisance-type offences\" rather than offences of a violent nature. In sum, he did not \"find him particularly dangerous at the present time\". B.Reasons on the Dangerous Offender Application 9Given the evidence before him, Tobias J. concluded that the respondent was, in fact, a dangerous offender unders. 753(b) of theCriminal Code. In reaching this decision, he preferred the evidence of Dr. McDonald to that of Dr. Orchard, finding the latter's report to be \"ambiguous and disjunctive\". He also indicated that he was particularly influenced by the respondent's most recent admission, post-dating the commission of the predicate offences, in which he openly admitted that he has been having irrepressible thoughts about sex with young children. Tobias J. also concluded that treatment was unlikely to repress these stated urges, particularly given the respondent's failure to admit the need for it and his ambivalence toward the impact of his most recent behaviour. 10On the specific subject of the predicate offences, Tobias J. endorsed Dr. McDonald's conclusion that \"[a]lthough the predicate offences may appear less serious from an assaultive aspect, they are more blatant, indicating a lessening of control on the part of the respondent\". In response to defence counsel's specific plea that the predicate offences exhibited a decline in danger, Tobias J. stated the following: I have not been unmoved by the submissions of counsel for the respondent that the character of his behaviour has changed markedly over a period of 15 years from violent to harmless, with the result that the respondent cannot now be described as dangerous.",

    "text": "Nonetheless, these submissions have failed to persuade me that the violence and the brutality of the respondent's early sexual assaults do not continue to be evidenced in the pattern of his subsequent sexual assaults, including that conduct which resulted in his conviction upon the predicate offences. 11Given all of his findings, Tobias J. indicated that, pursuant tos. 753of theCriminal Code, he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that: (a) Robert Currie had been convicted of \"serious personal injury offences\"; and (b) his conduct since 1975, including the commission of the predicate offences, demonstrated a failure to control his sexual impulses and presented an existing likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other members of society. He granted the Crown's dangerous offender application. C.Reasons on Sentence 12Having granted the dangerous offender application, Tobias J. then turned his mind to the issue of sentencing. In doing so, he alluded to the fact that, unders. 761(1)of theCriminal Code, the National Parole Board is statutorily required to intermittently review the dangerous offender designation. He stated: S. 761(1)of theCriminal Codeprovides a framework by which the National Parole Board considers the incarceration of an individual sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, and in my respectful opinion, it is in that protection of the review set out in s. 761(1) that Mr. Currie will receive the consideration of his personality disorder, the status of that personality disorder, the status of his sexual deviation, and whether at a time in the future, he no longer is a dangerous offender and a threat to the public. I cannot say that in five years or six years or ten years that will occur. I must therefore sentence Mr. Currie to an indeterminate period in the penitentiary and leave to the evaluation by experts in the National Parole Board and in the penitentiary system the status of Mr. Currie's treatment and his right to re-enter society. Acknowledging that the purpose of s. 753(b) is the protection of the public, Tobias J. exercised his statutory discretion and imposed an indeterminate sentence. D.Ontario Court of Appeal(1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 444 (perBrooke, Finlayson and Carthy JJ.A.) 13On appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had wrongfully declared the respondent a dangerous offender and sentenced the respondent to time served.",

Although the previous sexual offences committed by the respondent were, at times, violent and extremely degrading, he noted (at p. 448) that the predicate offences were \"not nearly as serious\" and that the trial judge erred by failing to focus on the seriousness of the predicate offences themselves. In this respect, Finlayson J.A. criticized the nature of Dr. McDonald's evidence and preferred the report of Dr. Orchard which concluded that the \"relatively mild nature of the [accused's] predicate offences suggested that treatment had helped him to control his violent tendencies\" (p. 451). 14The Court of Appeal also held that the trial judge's decision was premised upon a misconception of the burden of proof. Finlayson J.A. interpreted the trial judge's concluding comment, as I have quoted above, that the respondent's submissions have \"failed to persuade me that the violence and the brutality of the respondent's early sexual assaults do not continue to be evidenced\" as an improper reversal of the burden of proof upon the respondent. 15Finlayson J.A. was also concerned with the trial judge's separate reasons for imposing the indeterminate sentence. He noted that the trial judge should not have derived any comfort from the fact that theCriminal Coderequires the National Parole Board to intermittently review a person's dangerous offender status. According to Finlayson J.A., in doing so, the trial judge effectively abdicated his responsibilities as sentencing judge.",

Mr. Dynar was indicted together with Maurice Cohen, who is also a Canadian citizen, in the United States District Court of Nevada. The United States indictment charged both Mr. Dynar and Mr. Cohen with one count of attempting to launder money in violation of Title 18,United States Code, § 1956(a)(3), and one count of conspiracy to violate Title 18,United States Code, § 1956(a)(3), contrary to Title 18,United States Code, § 371. The Government of the United States requested their extradition by Diplomatic Note dated November 30, 1992. This appeal relates to the request for the extradition of Mr. Dynar. 4The events that formed the basis of the indictment began with a telephone call placed on January 2, 1990, from Canada, by Mr. Dynar to a former associate, Lucky Simone, who was living in Nevada. The call was apparently made to seek investors for a business operation in the United States. Lucky Simone had, unbeknownst to Mr. Dynar, become a confidential informant working for FBI agent William Matthews. He informed Agent Matthews of Mr. Dynar's call, and Agent Matthews requested that Mr. Simone return the call. Mr. Simone gave his consent for Agent Matthews to record the conversation. 5Affidavit evidence filed by the Requesting State indicates that, during the 1980s, Mr. Dynar was the subject of investigations in the United States pertaining to the laundering of substantial amounts of money originating in the State of Nevada. Agent Matthews' involvement in the investigation of Mr. Dynar's activities began in 1988. When Mr. Dynar made contact with Lucky Simone in 1990, Agent Matthews deposed that he decided to determine whether or not Mr. Dynar was still involved in laundering money which was the proceeds of crime. He had Mr. Simone introduce a second confidential informant, known as \"Anthony\", to Mr. Dynar. Anthony was instructed to ask if Mr. Dynar would be willing to launder large sums obtained as a result of illegal trafficking. When asked, Mr. Dynar agreed with alacrity to launder money for Anthony. 6A great many conversations between the two men were recorded over the course of some months. On all of these occasions, Anthony was in Las Vegas, Nevada and Mr. Dynar was in Canada.",

Mr. Dynar insisted more than once that the amounts had to be large in order to make his efforts worthwhile.

Special Agent Charles Pine of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was able to identify the voice of Maurice Cohen in the background of several of the conversations. 7The initial plan of the American authorities was to set up the transfer of funds to Mr. Dynar in the United States. However, Mr. Dynar believed that he was the subject of a sealed indictment in the United States charging him with laundering very large sums of money and that if he travelled to that country, he would be arrested. It was accordingly agreed that Mr. Dynar's associate, Maurice Cohen, would meet Anthony's associate in Buffalo. Mr. Cohen was to take the money to Toronto where it would be laundered by Mr. Dynar. It would then be taken back to Buffalo by Mr. Cohen on the following day, after a commission for Mr. Dynar had been deducted. 8In Buffalo, Mr. Cohen met with Special Agent Dennis McCarthy of the IRS, who was posing as Anthony's associate. The conversations that took place between them in preparation for the transfer of funds were recorded by Agent McCarthy. They contain several statements to the effect that Mr. Cohen was working for Mr. Dynar, as well as some explanations of the logistics of the laundering scheme. In the end, however, the money was not transferred to Mr. Cohen. The FBI aborted the operation by pretending to arrest Agent McCarthy just prior to the transfer of the money.",

Mr. Cohen was allowed to return to Canada. 9A committal hearing under s. 13 of theExtradition Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E‐23, was held before Keenan J. of the Ontario Court (General Division). In support of the request for extradition of Mr. Dynar and Mr. Cohen, the United States as the Requesting State relied upon affidavits from the investigating officers and transcripts of the recorded telephone conversations. This evidence formed the basis for the decision to commit Mr. Dynar for extradition. 10Keenan J. proceeded on the assumption that there was no involvement by Canadian authorities in the investigation and he was therefore highly critical of the conduct of the United States authorities in carrying out the investigation. It subsequently became clear that the Canadian authorities had indeed been consulted and informed regarding the various stages of the investigation. A memo from a U.S. federal government lawyer received by the Canadian Department of Justice in response to Keenan J.'s decision indicated that a formal cooperative arrangement was in place in which information was exchanged between United States and Canadian authorities regarding Mr. Dynar's activities. 11Mr. Dynar's counsel complained of the lack of disclosure of the Canadian involvement in the investigation to the Minister of Justice in written submissions that were made prior to the Minister's decision to surrender Mr. Dynar. Mr. Dynar's counsel also attempted on two occasions to obtain full disclosure from the Minister of materials showing the course of dealings between the Canadian and American authorities. This disclosure was refused on both occasions on the basis that the Department of Justice did not possess the requested information, and in any event, that such disclosure was not appropriate in the extradition context. In his submissions to the Minister, Mr. Dynar's counsel also invoked compassionate grounds related to some of Mr. Dynar's health problems, and argued that Mr. Dynar should be prosecuted in Canada.",

Galligan J.A., for a unanimous court, allowed the appeal and the application for judicial review on the basis that the activities of Mr. Dynar would not constitute a criminal offence in Canada, even though they did constitute an offence under the applicable United States law: (1995), 25 O.R.

The appellant, Patrick Mara, was the owner and operator of the tavern and the appellant, Allan East, was the manager in charge of entertainment. 4Undercover police attended at the tavern on several days in March and April 1991. The officers testified about the adult entertainment being presented. Women performed exotic dances on stage, for which there was no charge. For a fee, the entertainer performed a \"table dance\" in which she would be nude, save for a long, unbuttoned blouse. The dancer would lower her chest to the patron's face, allowing the patron to suck and lick her breasts. For a larger fee, the dancer performed a \"special dance\" called a \"lap dance\". The dancer would sit on the patron's lap with her back to the patron and her bare buttocks on the patron's groin area. The trial judge summarized the sexual activity as follows: The conduct of each dancer with the customer is clearly detailed in the evidence, and includes: (a) being nude except for wearing an open shirt or blouse; (b) fondling her own breasts, buttocks, thighs and genitals while close to the customer; (c) sitting on a customer's lap and grinding her bare buttocks into his lap; (d) sitting on a customer's lap, reaching into his crotch and apparently masturbating the customer; (e) permitting the customer to touch and fondle her breasts, buttocks, thighs and genitals; (f) permitting the customer to kiss, lick and suck their breasts; (g) permitting what appeared to be cunnilingus. 5The appellants were charged with, being the manager or agent or person in charge, allowing an indecent performance to be presented contrary tos. 167(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. At trial, both appellants were acquitted. The Crown appealed and a unanimous five-judge panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals and entered convictions against both appellants.",

They stopped a vehicle whose driver was known to the police as a pimp and found M.F. inside. M.F. was taken to police headquarters by other police officers. She spent the next five hours there. During this time she spoke to the police officers, as well as others, including her mother. Const. Hollinger made a 45-minute tape recording of one of the conversations he had with her. Because the conversation was recorded, Const. Hollinger only made notes of M.F.'s date of birth, address and phone numbers. He did not want to go into a detailed interview with M.F. Around 5:00 a.m., she was taken to Hull Home, a secure youth custody and treatment centre. 3On June 1, 1993, Const. Hollinger testified at Family Court on an application for a secure treatment order for M.F. He told the court about the 45 minute taped interview, saying that it related to her life on the run and her being forced into prostitution. He said that she was cooperative, but told police a few lies during the interview. He also related her description of some of the things that had been done to her in various hotels, including the Ranger Motel. 4Following further investigation, Const. Hollinger discovered two other young girls at the Hull Home had also been part of the same prostitution network. On June 3, 1993, Const. Hollinger went to Hull Home and spoke to M.F. and two other 13-year-old girls. He gave each of them police witness statement forms, asking them to write out a statement describing their life on the street. He instructed the Hull Home staff to separate the girls while they wrote their statements. The next day, he returned to Hull Home with a pre-typed list of questions which he gave to each girl after receiving their written statements. 5Const. Hollinger turned his report and the written statements over to detectives from the vice unit for them to investigate the complaints of prostitution and sexual assault. However, the tape of the initial interview with M.F. was not turned over to them. 6In August 1993, the police laid several prostitution-related charges.",

Four men were charged with the assault of the young girls; the appellant, Vu, was charged with the sexual assault of M.F. only. The vice unit detectives spoke with M.F. on July 8, 1993. That interview was tape recorded and transcribed. 7By the time of the preliminary inquiry (February 28 -- March 2, 1994), Const. Hollinger had forgotten that he had tape recorded his conversation with M.F. and that she had told him something about the Ranger Motel incident. Some time between the interview and the trial, Const. Hollinger misplaced the tape. Const. Hollinger testified that he had searched for the tape but had not found it. 8The reason given by Const. Hollinger for the paucity of notes taken by him was that the day after he apprehended M.F., he shot the tire out of a car after a high speed chase and was consequently under investigation. He described it as \"quite a stressful time\". 9At trial, counsel for the accused applied for a stay of proceedings based on the Crown's failure to disclose the tape recording made by Const. Hollinger of the first complainant. Wilkins J. granted the application for a stay of proceedings. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.",

    "text": "98There must be a reasoned basis, grounded in the facts of the case and the way the trial has unfolded and will unfold, for concluding that the accused's right to make full answer and defence will probably be prejudiced by receiving the new evidence. The prejudice must be specific and identifiable. The judge may be expected to address issues like the following. If the evidence had been introduced earlier, what would the defence have done differently and how would that have affected the outcome? Has the defence lost opportunities to develop evidence which might well have undermined the late evidence? Is the potential prejudice capable of being corrected by permitting the defence time to cross-examine the witness, produce rebutting evidence, or recall witnesses who have earlier testified? 99\"Prejudice\", for the purposes of this inquiry, is used in the legal, procedural sense. The fact that the evidence tendered may be powerful evidence for the prosecution does not lead to a conclusion of prejudice. The inquiry into prejudice focuses not on the effect the evidence may have on the outcome of the trial, but on its effect on the accused's right to make full answer and defence. The question is not whether the evidence may tend to convict the accused, but whether it is likely to convict him unjustly. The just or fair trial is one which gets at the truth, while respecting the fundamental right of the accused to make full answer and defence. 100Nor does the inquiry into prejudice assume that the accused has a right to a trial conducted in accordance with a particular procedure. Rules of procedure are important aids to ensuring that trials are conducted fairly and accused persons are accorded the right to make full answer and defence. But they are not ends in themselves. They are the servants of justice, not its masters. Inevitably circumstances arise which make it necessary to deviate from this rule or that. The law permits this, provided that when the entire trial is viewed as a whole, it cannot be said that injustice has resulted or that an accused has been denied his right to make full answer and defence.

Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at p. 587perMcLachlin J.. 101Finally, in exercising his or her discretion to admit late evidence, the judge must not overlook the importance of providing the trier of fact with the evidence it needs to resolve the issues before it. As Cory J. put it inAalders,supra,\"the rules should not go so far as to deprive the trier of fact of important evidence, that can be helpful to resolving an essential element of the case\" (pp. 498-99). Although the emphasis is on the protection of the accused during the third stage of the trial (P. (M.B.),supra, at p. 570), society's interest in the efficient administration of justice is still a valid consideration. The judge must consider both in deciding whether to admit evidence which appears for the first time late in the trial. The more serious the prejudice to the accused in allowing the evidence to be admitted, the less important are society's interests. 102In summary, the approach of presumptive or inferred prejudice suggested by Cory J. in this case is inconsistent with the approach taken by the English courts in cases likeMcKennaand this Court in cases likeRobillardandAalders,supra. The jurisprudence suggests that a trial judge has a discretion to receive unforeseen evidence late in the trial provided the accused's right to make full answer and defence is not thereby prejudiced, and that absent apparent injustice, a court of appeal should not interfere with the exercise of this discretion. The same jurisprudence suggests that the inquiry before the trial judge is founded in the facts and circumstances of the particular case and that there is no presumption or automatic inference of prejudice. The question is whether in the particular circumstances of the case, actual prejudice to the right to make full answer and defence is likely to result. This approach protects both our system of justice and the accused'sCharterrights.",

(3d) 54 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 87;ReChambers and The Queen(1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 440 (Ont. C.A.);Zanini v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 715. 10.In my view, this approach also offers a number of advantages. First, I believe it accords with the general notion that the \"punishment\" should be in accord with the crime: Eric Colvin,Principles of Criminal Law(2nd ed. 1991), at p. 28. A trafficking conviction, in the circumstances indicated above, is quite harsh, carries with it considerable stigma and has negative consequences for the repute of justice. In this regard, it is also worth noting that the sentencing structure for these offences is rather disparate. A trafficking conviction is punishable by up to life imprisonment, while a possession conviction carries a maximum seven-year sentence. 11.Perhaps more importantly, I believe this approach benefits from a certain symmetry. It is clear that someone whose acts are designed to aid a purchaser, yet incidentally benefit the seller, has assisted much more in the purchase of the narcotic than in the sale. As such, it is only fitting that this person share the culpability and stigma of the purchaser rather than that of the vendor. 12.Moreover, it addresses the concern set out at para. 32 by Cory J. that \"[i]f the same exception which applies to purchasers were extended to agents for the purchaser, then the agents could escape culpability entirely\". In my view, this is a valid concern which is certainly not ignored by this approach; where the facts warrant it, agents or people assisting a purchaser could well face a conviction for aiding or abetting possession of a narcotic. 13.In the case at bar, however, I have no difficulty concluding that the appellant did far more than act as a purchaser. My colleague has described the nature of the appellant's participation in the sale in detail, and these facts demonstrate a concerted effort on his part to effect the transfer of narcotics. The appellant located the seller, brought the buyer to the site and introduced the parties. It is clear that without this assistance, the purchase would never have taken place.",

Moreover, he acted as a spokesperson, negotiated the price of the drugs, and passed the money over to the seller. He also accepted money for having facilitated the deal. As my colleague points out, without the appellant's assistance, the buyer would never have been able to enter the apartment building and contact the seller. These are not the acts of a mere purchaser, and as a result it is clear that the appellant aided the traffic of narcotics. 14.With respect to the required intention to commit such an offence under s. 21(1)(b) of theCode, and whether it was established in this case, I am in complete agreement with the approach taken by my colleague. 15.I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by Cory J. //Cory J.// The reasons of Cory, McLachlin and Major JJ. were delivered by 16Cory J.-- A purchaser of narcotics can be found guilty of possession of drugs or possession of drugs for the purposes of trafficking. As a result of this exposure to criminal prosecution for these offences it has been determined that a purchaser of drugs cannot be convicted of aiding or abetting a vendor of drugs. Courts have differed as to the culpability of one who assists the purchaser. In some cases it has been held that, since the purchaser could not be found guilty of aiding and abetting, someone assisting the purchaser must also be found not guilty. Other decisions appear to come to a different conclusion. The question which must be addressed on this appeal is whether a person who aids or abets a purchaser of drugs should be found guilty as a party to the illegal drug transaction.",

The respondent was charged in February of 1993 with having accepted a benefit or advantage in consideration for cooperating, assisting, or exercising influence in connection with a matter of business relating to the government, contrary tos.121(1)(a)(ii) and (iii) of theCriminal Code. 3.At trial, the parties presented the trial judge with a joint statement of facts. No witnesses were called to give evidence. The agreed facts were summarized by the trial judge as follows: [translation] On May 2, 1986, the accused was appointed to the Senate and began receiving a senator's salary. Since April 1985, he had been acting and was being paid as a lawyer for a number of companies, including Silicart and Gigamos. The principal shareholder of these companies was one Guy Montpetit. Since April 1985, the accused had been making representations to the various levels of government on behalf of Montpetit's companies in his capacity as their lawyer. After his appointment to the Senate, the accused continued to make representations to the various levels of government on behalf of Guy Montpetit's companies for the purpose of obtaining grants. These representations were made in particular to a federal‐provincial committee chaired at the time by one Gabriel Voyer. All the accused's efforts to obtain grants for Guy Montpetit's companies were in vain. The accused also approached the Secretary of State at the time, Mr. Lucien Bouchard, to obtain the contract to translate Saskatchewan's legislation for one of Guy Montpetit's companies, but was unsuccessful. It can be seen from the evidence that the accused was very effective in having ministers and senior officials meet in order to \"advance\" his client's business. It can also be seen from the evidence that while he appeared to be very good at having these people meet very quickly, the meetings never had the expected success, as no grants were awarded to Guy Montpetit's companies. For all these fruitless approaches to governments, for corporate law work and for approaches to private investors, the accused received fees totalling $162,000.00 for the period referred to in the charge.",

Supreme Court. 12The first reference,Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, was issued on October 11, 1994 by Order in Council No. EC646/94, pursuant to s. 18 of theSupreme Court Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. S-10, and came about as a result of reductions in the salaries of judges of the P.E.I. Provincial Court by thePublic Sector Pay Reduction Act, S.P.E.I. 1994, c. 51. This statute reduced the salaries of the judges and others paid from the public purse in P.E.I. by 7.5 percent effective May 17, 1994. The Act was part of the province's plan to reduce its budget deficit. Following the pay reduction, numerous accused persons challenged the constitutionality of proceedings before them in the Provincial Court, alleging that as a result of the salary reductions, the court had lost its status as an independent and impartial tribunal unders. 11(d)of theCharter. In response to the uncertainty created by these challenges, the provincial government issued a reference to elucidate the constitutional contours of the power of the provincial legislature to decrease, increase or otherwise adjust the remuneration of judges of the Provincial Court, and to determine whether the judges of the Provincial Court still enjoyed a sufficient degree of financial security for the purposes of s. 11(d). The Appeal Division rendered judgment on December 16, 1994: (1994), 125 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 335, 389 A.P.R. 335, 120 D.L.R. (4th) 449, 95 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 33 C.P.C. (3d) 76, [1994] P.E.I.J. No. 123 (QL). For present purposes, it is sufficient to simply state that the court found the judges of the Provincial Court to be independent. 13The second reference,Reference re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, was issued on February 13, 1995, by Order in Council No. EC132/95, and arose out of the controversy surrounding the first reference.",

(4th) 528, 39 C.P.C. (3d) 241, [1995] P.E.I.J. No. 66 (QL). The appellants (who are the same appellants as in the first reference) appeal from this holding. However, the court did hold that Provincial Court judges lacked a sufficient degree of security of tenure to meet the standard set bys. 11(d)of theCharter. The respondent Crown cross-appeals from this aspect of the judgment. 15Because of their length and complexity, I have chosen to append the questions put in the two P.E.I. references as Appendices \"A\" and \"B\". B.R. v. Campbell, R. v. Ekmecic and R. v. Wickman 16This appeal arises out of three separate and unrelated criminal proceedings commenced against the respondents Shawn Carl Campbell, Ivica Ekmecic, and Percy Dwight Wickman in the province of Alberta. Campbell was charged with unlawful possession of a prohibited weapon, contrary tos. 90(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, and subsequently, in connection with the charge of unlawful possession, with failing to attend court in contravention ofs. 145(5)of theCriminal Code. Wickman was charged with two different offences — operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate that vehicle was impaired by alcohol, in violation ofs. 253(a) of theCriminal Code, and operating a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams, in contravention ofs. 253(b) of theCriminal Code.",

    "text": "Ekmecic was charged with unlawful assault contrary tos. 266of theCriminal Code. 17The three respondents pled not guilty, and the Crown elected to proceed summarily in all three cases. The accused appeared, in separate proceedings, before the Alberta Provincial Court. At various points in their trials, they each brought a motion before the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, arguing that the Provincial Court was not an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of s. 11(d). The trials for Campbell and Ekmecic were both adjourned before they commenced. Wickman, by contrast, moved for and was granted an adjournment after the Crown had completed its case and six witnesses had testified for the defence, including the accused. Amongst the three of them, the respondents sought orders in the nature of prohibition,certiorari, declarations, and stays. 18The allegations of unconstitutionality,inter alia, dealt with a 5 percent reduction in the salaries of judges of the Provincial Court brought about by thePayment to Provincial Judges Amendment Regulation, Alta. Reg. 116/94, and s. 17(1) of theProvincial Court Judges Act, S.A. 1981, c. P-20.1, which is the statutory basis for the aforementioned regulation. The 5 percent reduction was accomplished by a 3.1 percent direct salary reduction, and by 5 unpaid days leave of absence. The respondents also attacked the constitutionality of changes to the judges' pension plan by theProvincial Judges and Masters in Chambers Pension Plan Amendment Regulation, Alta. Reg. 29/92, and theManagement Employees Pension Plan, Alta. Reg. 367/93, which respectively had the effect of reducing the base salary for calculating pension benefits, and limiting cost of living increases to 60 percent of the Consumer Price Index. In addition, the respondents challenged the constitutionality of the power of the Attorney General to designate the court's sitting days and judges' place of residence. McDonald J., on the motions, also put at issue the process for disciplining Provincial Court judges and the grounds for removal of judges of the Provincial Court. 19Finally, and in large part, the constitutional challenges seem to have been precipitated by the remarks of Premier Ralph Klein during a radio interview.",

    "text": "Mr. Klein stated that a judge of the provincial youth court, who had indicated that he would not sit in protest over his salary reduction, should be \"very, very quickly fired\". 20All three motions were heard by McDonald J., who found that the Alberta Provincial Court was no longer independent: (1994), 160 A.R. 81, 25 Alta. L.R. (3d) 158, [1995] 2 W.W.R. 469, [1994] A.J. No. 866 (QL). However, he obviated the need for a stay by issuing a declaration that provincial legislation and regulations which were the source of the s. 11(d) violation were of no force or effect. As a result, although the Crown lost on the constitutional issue, it won on the issue of the stay. The Crown appealed to the Alberta Court of Appeal, which held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeals, and therefore did not consider the merits of the arguments: (1995), 169 A.R. 178, 97 W.A.C. 178, 31 Alta. L.R. (3d) 190, 100 C.C.C. (3d) 167, [1995] 8 W.W.R. 747, [1995] A.J. No. 610 (QL). The Crown now appeals to this Court, both on the question of the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction and the merits of the constitutional issue. I stated constitutional questions on June 26, 1996. These questions can be found in Appendix \"C\". C.Manitoba Provincial Judges Assn. v. Manitoba (Minister of Justice) 21This appeal deals with reductions to the salaries of judges of the Manitoba Provincial Court, byThe Public Sector Reduced Work Week and Compensation Management Act, S.M. 1993, c. 21, otherwise known as \"Bill 22\". Bill 22 led to the reduction of the salaries of a large number of public sector employees, including employees of Crown corporations, hospitals, personal care homes, child and family services agencies, municipalities, school boards, universities and colleges. The legislation was passed as part of a plan to reduce the province's deficit. Bill 22 provided for different treatment of the several classes of employees to which it applied. It provided that public sector employers \"may\" require employees to take unpaid days of leave. However, judges of the Provincial Court, along with persons who received remuneration as members of a Crown agency or a board, commission or committee to which they were appointed by the government, received a mandatory reduction of 3.8 percent in the 1993-94 fiscal year.",

The appellant was charged with first degree murder in the shooting of Patrick William Campbell. After the appellant changed counsel several times, the trial got under way. The appellant had planned to testify in his own defence but, after the Crown closed its case, his counsel made aCorbettapplication to the trial judge. The appellant's criminal record was extensive, to say the least. He had been convicted of numerous thefts, assaults of varying severity, robbery, some weapons offences, threatening, wilful damage, failure to attend, failure to appear, obstructing a peace officer, trafficking in a narcotic, and impaired driving. 3The trial judge did not make a ruling at that time, but rather indicated that he would prefer to wait until the appellant had given his testimony in chief, as one of the determining factors is the nature of the evidence adduced by the defence. The appellant then advised his counsel that he would not be testifying, and the defence closed its case. The appellant was convicted of first degree murder. 4In a unanimous, unattributed judgment reported at (1995), 174 A.R. 234, 102 W.A.C. 234, 102 C.C.C. (3d) 281, [1995] A.J. No. 906 (QL), the Alberta Court of Appeal briefly reviewed the decision inCorbettand noted that this Court did not decide at what point in the trial the Judge should rule on the exclusion of the accused's previous convictions. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that theCorbettapplication could not be decided in a vacuum. They therefore concluded that the appellant is not entitled to have the admissibility of the record determined in advance of the decision to testify. The proper course would have been to conduct avoir direto determine the admissibility of the appellant's record when the trial judge believed he had all the requisite information. However, it could not be said that the trial judge would have failed to conduct avoir direhad the appellant elected to testify.",

    "text": "2The appellant, Margaret Ann Malott, and the deceased, Paul Malott, were common law spouses for about 19 years and had two children together. The appellant had previously been married for seven years to a man who violently abused her and their five children. Mr. Malott abused Mrs. Malott physically, sexually, psychologically and emotionally. She had gone to the police, but Mr. Malott was a police informant on drug deals and the police told him of her complaints, resulting in an escalation of his violence towards her. A few months before the shooting, Mr. Malott separated from the appellant, took their son and went to live with his girlfriend, Carrie Sherwood. Malott and their daughter continued to live at Mr. Malott's mother's house. Contact between Mr. and Mrs. Malott continued after the separation, as he dropped by his mother's home on a regular basis, often bringing Ms. Sherwood with him. 3On March 23, 1991, Mrs. Malott was scheduled to go to a medical centre with the deceased to get prescription drugs for use in the deceased's illegal drug trade. She took a .22 calibre pistol from Mr. Malott's gun cabinet, loaded it and carried it in her purse. After driving to the medical centre with Mr. Malott, she shot him to death. She then took a taxi to Ms. Sherwood's home, shot her and stabbed her with a knife. Ms. Sherwood survived and testified as a Crown witness. 4At trial, the appellant testified to the extensive abuse which she had suffered. The Crown conceded that the appellant had been subject to terrible physical and mental abuse at the hands of Mr. Malott. The appellant led expert evidence to show that she suffered from battered woman syndrome. The appellant raised three defences: self-defence, drug-induced intoxication and provocation, but relied primarily on self-defence. The jury found the appellant guilty of second degree murder in the death of Paul Malott and of attempted murder of Carrie Sherwood. The jury made a recommendation that because of the severity of the battered woman syndrome, the appellant should receive the minimum sentence. 5The appellant appealed both convictions. The appeal was heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal on May 28, 1996. It is only the conviction for second degree murder of the deceased that is before this Court.",

[42]The second is fromR. v. Dipnarine, 2014 ABCA 328, 584 A.R. 138, at paras. 22 and 24-25. The court stated that \"[c]ircumstantial evidence does not have to totally exclude other conceivable inferences\"; that the trier of fact should not act on alternative interpretations of the circumstances that it considers to be unreasonable; and that alternative inferences must be reasonable, not just possible. [43]Where the line is to be drawn between speculation and reasonable inferences in a particular case cannot be described with greater clarity than it is in these passages. (b)Did the Trial Judge Err? [44]I return to the question of whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to find a legal error in relation to circumstantial evidence in the trial judge's reasons. [45]The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred because he failed to consider reasonable inferences inconsistent with guilt that could have arisen froma lack of evidence. The court found that, by failing to give the accused the benefit of \"gaps\" in the evidence, the trial judge had, in effect, put a burden on the accused to prove something: paras. 19-20. The respondent supports that conclusion and makes two additional points. He submits that the trial judge erred in relying onMcIverwhich wrongly required inferences alternative to guilt to be supported by the evidence and that the trial judge relied on inapplicable sources —certiorariapplications to quash committals to stand trial, where the beyond a reasonable doubt standard does not apply. In doing so, it is submitted, the judge failed to appreciate the burden of proof on the Crown and the difference between the standard applied when deciding to commit someone to stand trial at a preliminary inquiry and the reasonable doubt standard applied at trial. [46]I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal's conclusion and I cannot accept the respondent's submissions.",

He had been shot twice in the upper body with a 12-gauge shotgun, and four times in the head with a .22 calibre pistol. Chiu had last been seen alive at about 8:00 p.m. the previous evening in the company of the appellants. The appellants were seen together later that night, but without Chiu. The three men were known to be friends, having served time together at Joyceville Penitentiary. All three had been released on parole earlier in the year. A.The Appellants' Departure from Ottawa 4As stated, the central issue in these appeals concerns the behaviour of the appellants after Chiu was killed. The appellants remained in Ottawa on August 27 but did not return home that night and were not seen again in the area for nearly two weeks. It is not clear precisely when they left Ottawa, but on the morning of August 29 they robbed a bank in Mississauga, Ontario, about 500 kilometres away. One week later, on September 5, they robbed the same bank. During these robberies Côté fired a 12-gauge shotgun and a .22 calibre pistol, and left behind shells and cartridge cases that matched those found at the scene of Chiu's murder. The appellants admitted the facts concerning both robberies. 5From August 29 until September 7, the appellants stayed at two motels in Burlington, Ontario. During that time Côté missed a meeting with his parole officer in Ottawa, and White failed to respond to a letter regarding a similar meeting that he had missed earlier in the month. As a result of these parole violations, arrest warrants were issued for both appellants. White also failed to pick up a $400 social assistance cheque in Ottawa which he knew was available since August 30. On August 31, Côté called his landlord in Ottawa and asked him to gather his \"things\" and put them aside. Côté said that someone would pick them up because he would not be returning. When the landlord asked why, Côté replied: \"the less you know, the better.\" B.Evidence of Paul Corner 6Paul Corner testified for the Crown as an accomplice witness. On the stand, he admitted that he had a criminal record, including numerous offences of dishonesty.",

Corner testified that he was acquainted with the appellants from Joyceville Penitentiary, and that he met with them on August 29 in Burlington and registered them at a motel under his name that night. According to Corner, the following events unfolded in the appellants' motel room. White and Côté unpacked their bags and removed a 12-gauge shotgun and a .22 calibre pistol. Côté then stated that he had \"better see what it is like down in Ottawa\" and placed a telephone call. At the end of the ensuing conversation, which Corner could not follow because it was in French, Côté turned to White and said: \"everything is cool, there is no heat\". White then turned to Corner and explained that he and Côté had \"snuffed somebody\" in Ottawa, and more specifically that they had shot somebody to death with a shotgun and a pistol. When Corner expressed concern about his car, which he had lent to White earlier in the month, White assured him that \"the car is fine, we didn't -- there is no heat on [the] car\". Corner further testified that Côté was anxious to \"get rid of the .22\" and that White agreed to do so as soon as they could get another one. According to Corner, White also said that he and Côté were \"going away\" and needed money. Corner testified that he got the impression from the appellants that they were planning to go \"west\". C.Flight from the Police in Ottawa 7White and Côté returned to Ottawa on September 7, 1989. The following morning the Ottawa police were tipped off, caught up with the appellants, and signalled for them to stop their car. The appellants accelerated and a short chase ensued. The appellants drove down a side street, slowed down, leapt from their car while it was still moving, and began running away. Some officers gave chase on foot. When one of the officers fired a shot in the air, Côté stopped and was arrested at gunpoint. White continued to flee, and threw a .22 calibre pistol under a parked car as he ran.",

    "text": "3On April 12, 1991, a Montreal taxicab was found submerged in the Madawaska River near Arnprior, Ontario. The body of the taxi's driver, Octavio Velasquez, was only discovered two months later in a secluded area several kilometres away. An autopsy revealed that Velasquez had died from multiple stab wounds to the back. There was no question that Velasquez had been murdered; the sole issue at trial was whether Ménard had killed him. 4At about 2:00 p.m. on April 12, Jack Schultz, a worker at a water filtration plant in Arnprior, saw a taxicab driving near the Madawaska River, and several minutes later he heard a splash. When he approached the riverbank he observed a car sinking into the water and saw the appellant standing nearby with a duffle bag and a bundle of white clothing. Schultz called the police; they arrived some three minutes later. 5Constable Nicholas of the Ontario Provincial Police saw the partly submerged taxi, and Ménard crouching at the top of a hill. He called for Ménard to come down and proceeded to question him about what had happened. Ménard stated that he had been hitchhiking from Ottawa and was picked up by a man named Phil, who was drinking alcohol and driving \"crazy\". Phil allegedly stopped the car at the top of the hill above the river, told the appellant \"[t]he ride ends here, get out\", and then drove the car into the water and ran away. Ménard gave a description of Phil and indicated the direction in which Phil had allegedly fled on foot. 6Other officers soon arrived on the scene. They examined the area where the car had entered the water and found one set of footprints, which did not head in the direction of Phil's ostensible flight from the scene. The police climbed to where the appellant had been crouching and located a bundle of wet clothes, consisting of a white trench coat, a pair of jeans, socks and black boots. The coat and jeans were stained with blood. In the pocket of the jeans, Constable Nicholas found a ledger sheet in Ménard's name from a military credit union. He asked Ménard who owned the wet clothes.",

He asked Ménard who owned the wet clothes. Ménard initially claimed that they were Phil's; however, when confronted with the ledger sheet, he admitted that the jeans were his but maintained that the rest of the clothing belonged to Phil. Constable Nicholas arrested Ménard for possession of a stolen car. 7When the taxicab was removed from the river, blood stains were found on the driver's seat and headrest as well as on the floor around the driver's seat. Forensic tests revealed that those stains were consistent with the victim's blood group, which was shared by only 0.83 percent of the population. Stains consistent with the victim's blood were also found on Ménard's jeans and on the other clothing retrieved from the hill where Ménard had been crouching, as well as on underwear that Ménard had in his duffle bag. The back of the reversible cap that Ménard carried in his pocket also had approximately 40 spatter stains on it. A black-handled knife, in its sheath, was recovered from the river near where the taxicab had been found. No forensic evidence was introduced to connect the knife to the appellant. 8After the body of Octavio Velasquez was discovered on June 9, 1991, Constable Nicholas took soil samples from the area where the body was found. He also took soil samples from the area where the wet clothing was found and where the taxicab entered the river. These various samples were analysed by a forensic geologist, William Graves, who also examined some debris brushed from Ménard's boots. It was concluded that part of the debris from the boots was indistinguishable from the body-site soil samples. 9In addition to the foregoing circumstantial evidence, the Crown also introduced identification evidence from several motorists who testified to seeing a Montreal taxicab on the highway between Montreal and Ottawa. Only one of these witnesses, Sidney Ritchie, actually placed Ménard in the taxicab with the deceased.",

    "text": "Only one of these witnesses, Sidney Ritchie, actually placed Ménard in the taxicab with the deceased. Ritchie's evidence was challenged at trial on the ground that Ritchie had failed to pick the appellant out of a photo lineup and had only been able to make a positive identification at the preliminary inquiry, when the appellant was the only man in the room aside from counsel and court staff. Moreover, Ritchie had been advised at that time that the appellant was the person charged with the murder. 10At his trial, Ménard gave a different version of events from what he had told Constable Nicholas at the time of his arrest. He testified that he had been hitchhiking from Montreal when he was picked up by Phil, who was driving a Montreal Co-op Taxi. Phil allegedly drove the taxi for five or ten minutes, then pulled over, told the appellant to keep the car, and left in another car that had pulled up behind the taxi. When Phil stepped out of the taxi, Ménard allegedly noticed that Phil's back was spotted with blood and that some brown staining was also visible on the driver's seat. Ménard testified that he assumed the car must have been stolen by Phil; nevertheless, he got into the driver's seat and drove on because he did not know what else to do. After driving for a short period of time, he allegedly stopped in the parking lot of a shopping mall and concluded that he had made a bad decision.

    "text": "3The respondent, Consumers' Gas Company Limited (\"Consumers' Gas\" or \"CG\"), is a regulated utility which provides natural gas to commercial and residential customers throughout Ontario. Its rates and payment policies are governed by the Ontario Energy Board (\"OEB\" or \"Board\") pursuant to theOntario Energy Board Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.13, and theMunicipal Franchises Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. The respondent cannot sell gas or charge for gas-related services except in accordance with rate orders issued by the Board. 4Consumers' Gas bills its customers on a monthly basis, and each bill includes a \"due date\" for the payment of current charges. The due date normally falls on the 10th day (for commercial customers) or the 16th day (for residential customers) after the bill is issued. Customers who do not pay by the due date incur a late payment penalty (\"LPP\") calculated at five percent of the unpaid charges for that month. The LPP is a one-time penalty, and does not compound or increase over time. Customers can avoid the LPP by participating in a pre-authorized payment system, whereby the amount of their monthly bill is deducted automatically on the due date from a designated bank account. 5Consumers' Gas offers its customers two billing plans. Under the normal plan, customers are simply billed for the cost of goods and services which they consume each month. Under the \"Equal Billing Plan\", CG estimates the customer's yearly consumption, bills an equal amount each month for 10 months, settles any balance in the 11th month, and bills for actual use in the 12th. About half of CG's customers subscribe to each type of plan. Late-paying customers are subject to the LPP regardless of which plan is used. 6The LPP was implemented in 1975 following a series of rate hearings conducted by the OEB. In granting CG's application to impose the penalty, the Board noted that the primary purpose of the LPP is to encourage customers to pay their bills promptly, thereby reducing the cost to CG of carrying accounts receivable. The Board also held that such costs, along with any special collection costs arising from late payments, should be borne by the customers who cause them to be incurred, rather than by the customer base as a whole.",

In approving a flat penalty of five percent, the OEB rejected the alternative course of imposing a daily interest charge on overdue accounts. The Board reasoned that an interest charge would not provide sufficient incentive to pay by a named date, would give little weight to collection costs, and might seem overly complicated. The Board recognized that if a bill is paid very soon after the due date, the penalty can, if calculated as an interest charge, be shown to represent a very high rate of interest. However, it noted that customers could avoid such a charge by paying their bills on time, and that in any event in the case of the average bill the dollar amount of the penalty would not be very large. 7On several occasions since its adoption, the LPP has been reviewed and re-approved by the OEB in essentially the same form. From 1981 until 1989, rate orders issued by the Board with regard to Consumers' Gas incorporated the following provision (applicable to residential customers): PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT: When payment in full is not made within sixteen (16) days of the date of mailing, or the hand delivery of the bill, a penalty of five per cent (5%) of the current amount billed shall be levied.... Beginning in 1989, CG rate orders incorporated this statement from the respondent's Handbook of Rates and Distribution Services (applicable to all customers):",

They had no indication as to the nature of the 911 distress. They did not know whether the call was in response to a criminal action or not. They had the common law duty (statutorily codified in s. 42(3) of the Act) to act to protect life and safety. Therefore, the police had the duty to respond to the 911 call. Having arrived at the appellant's apartment, their duty extended to ascertaining the reason for the call. Acceptance of the appellant's bald assertion that there was \"no problem\" would have been insufficient to satisfy that duty. The police had the power, derived as a matter of common law from this duty, to enter the apartment to verify that there was in fact no emergency. The fact that the appellant tried to shut the door on the police further contributes to the appropriateness of their response in forcing entry. As I have already discussed, the privacy interest of the person at the door must yield to the interests of any person inside the apartment. A threat to life and limb more directly engages the values of dignity, integrity and autonomy underlying the right to privacy than does the interest in being free from the minimal state intrusion of police entering an apartment to investigate a potential emergency. Once inside the apartment, the police heard the appellant's wife crying. They had a duty to search the apartment and find her. In my view, Finlayson J.A. for the Court of Appeal correctly concluded that the police conduct was a justifiable use of their powers.",

She met the accused respondent Ewanchuk on the afternoon of June 2, 1994, while walking through the parking lot of the Heritage Shopping Mall with her roommate. The accused, driving a red van towing a trailer, approached the two young women. He struck up a conversation with them. He related that he was in the custom wood-working business and explained that he displayed his work at retail booths in several shopping malls. He said that he was looking for staff to attend his displays, and asked whether the young women were looking for work. The complainant's friend answered that they were, at which point the accused asked to interview her friend privately. She declined, but spoke with the accused beside his van for some period of time about the sort of work he required, and eventually exchanged telephone numbers with the accused. 3The following morning the accused telephoned the apartment where the complainant and her friend resided with their boyfriends. The complainant answered the phone. She told the accused that her friend was still asleep. When he learned this, the accused asked the complainant if she was interested in a job. She indicated that she was, and they met a short time later, again in the Heritage Mall parking lot. At the accused's suggestion, the interview took place in his van. In the words of the complainant, a \"very business-like, polite\" conversation took place. Some time later, the complainant asked if she could smoke a cigarette, and the accused suggested that they move outside since he was allergic to cigarette smoke. Once outside the van, he asked the complainant if she would like to see some of his work, which was kept inside the trailer attached to his van, and she indicated that she would. 4The complainant entered the trailer, purposely leaving the door open behind her. The accused followed her in, and closed the door in a way which made the complainant think that he had locked it. There is no evidence whether the door was actually locked, but the complainant stated that she became frightened at this point. Once inside the trailer, the complainant and the accused sat down side-by-side on the floor of the trailer. They spoke and looked through a portfolio of his work.",

This lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which the conversation turned to more personal matters. 5During the time in the trailer the accused was quite tactile with the complainant, touching her hand, arms and shoulder as he spoke. At some point the accused said that he was feeling tense and asked the complainant to give him a massage. The complainant complied, massaging the accused's shoulders for a few minutes. After she stopped, he asked her to move in front of him so that he could massage her, which she did. The accused then massaged the complainant's shoulders and arms while they continued talking. During this mutual massaging the accused repeatedly told the complainant to relax, and that she should not be afraid. As the massage progressed, the accused attempted to initiate more intimate contact. The complainant stated that, \"he started to try to massage around my stomach, and he brought his hands up around -- or underneath my breasts, and he started to get quite close up there, so I used my elbows to push in between, and I said, No\". 6The accused stopped immediately, but shortly thereafter resumed non-sexual massaging, to which the complainant also said, \"No\". The accused again stopped, and said, \"See, I'm a nice guy. It's okay\". 7The accused then asked the complainant to turn and face him. She did so, and he began massaging her feet. His touching progressed from her feet up to her inner thigh and pelvic area. The complainant did not want the accused to touch her in this way, but said nothing as she said she was afraid that any resistance would prompt the accused to become violent. Although the accused never used or threatened any force, the complainant testified that she did not want to \"egg [him] on\". As the contact progressed, the accused laid himself heavily on top of the complainant and began grinding his pelvic area against hers. The complainant testified that the accused asserted, \"that he could get me so horny so that I would want it so bad, and he wouldn't give it to me because he had self-control\". 8The complainant did not move or reciprocate the contact.",

On the stand she stated that she was afraid throughout, and only responded to the accused in this way because she was fearful that a negative answer would provoke him to use force. 9After this brief exchange, the accused went to hug the complainant and, as he did so, he laid on top of her again, continuing the pelvic grinding. He also began moving his hands on the complainant's inner thigh, inside her shorts, for a short time. While still on top of her the accused began to fumble with his shorts and took out his penis. At this point the complainant again asked the accused to desist, saying, \"No, stop\". 10Again, the accused stopped immediately, got off the complainant, smiled at her and said something to the effect of, \"It's okay. See, I'm a nice guy, I stopped\". At this point the accused again hugged the complainant lightly before opening up his wallet and removing a $100 bill, which he gave to the complainant. She testified that the accused said that the $100 was for the massage and that he told her not to tell anyone about it. He made some reference to another female employee with whom he also had a very close and friendly relationship, and said that he hoped to get together with the complainant again. 11Shortly after the exchange of the money the complainant said that she had to go. The accused opened the door and the complainant stepped out. Some further conversation ensued outside the trailer before the complainant finally left and walked home. On her return home the complainant was emotionally distraught and contacted the police. 12At some point during the encounter the accused provided the complainant with a brochure describing his woodwork and gave her his name and address, which she wrote on the brochure.",

In August of 1977 the respondents approached one Brian Rosenthal, a partner with Yale, seeking additional financing for Casecam Manufacturing. Mr. Rosenthal arranged for a group of investors to provide funds for a factoring scheme by which the respondents would sell Casecam Manufacturing's accounts receivable for cash and the buyer of the accounts receivable would collect the sum due from Casecam Manufacturing's clients. 4.Mr. Rosenthal arranged for a \"conduit\", in the form of a sole proprietorship called Casecam Financial Services, to channel funds from individual investors to Casecam Manufacturing. Casecam Financial Services was established in the name of Anna Teremy, Rosenthal's secretary and common‐law wife. The routine established was that when Casecam Manufacturing required funds, the respondent Kotler would notify Mr. Rosenthal or Ms. Teremy of the name and the amount of the receivables to be assigned. Mr. Rosenthal would then arrange for an individual investor to provide funds to Casecam Financial Services. A contract of assignment would be prepared, and the assignment would be registered. The respondents provided copies of the invoices for completed sales, and a cheque would be issued to the respondents in the name of Casecam Financial Services. The respondents in turn would issue a cheque to Casecam Financial Services for the first month's interest (21⁄2 per cent per month), which was divided between Casecam Financial Services (1⁄2 per cent) and the individual investor (2 per cent). 5.In November 1977, the respondents acquired an interest in Gorlee Greenhouses, a division of Casecam Manufacturing. A similar factoring scheme was operated in relation to Gorlee Greenhouses, with a sole proprietorship called Gorlee Financial Services registered in Ms. Teremy's name and purchasing its accounts receivable. 6.These schemes operated until April or May of 1978, when it was discovered that the respondents had been submitting false invoices to Casecam Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services. These invoices totalled about $524,765. When confronted with this, the respondents made partial restitution ($80,000), but filed a corporate assignment in bankruptcy on May 29, 1978.

This operation was undertaken after Corporal Richard Reynolds of the RCMP became aware of the decision of the Quebec Superior Court inR. v. Lore(an unreported decision of Pinard J., March 8, 1991, No. 500-01-013926-891) which, in Cpl. Reynolds' view, gave implicit approval to a reverse sting operation in which police offered to sell narcotics to suspected drug traffickers. Reynolds contacted Mr. James Leising, an experienced senior lawyer employed by the Department of Justice in Toronto, to obtain professional advice as to the legality of a reverse sting operation. Seven or eight meetings were held between Cpl. Reynolds and the Department of Justice lawyer in relation to the proposed operation. In September of 1991, approval by senior RCMP officers was given to initiate the reverse sting. Using the help of a police informant, the police contacted two groups of potential purchasers through the appellant Shirose. Negotiations with these groups included showing the hashish to prospective purchasers. However, the RCMP was careful not to provide any samples, despite requests to do so. The hashish remained under the control of the RCMP at all times. The appellant Campbell eventually participated in the negotiations as a financier for one of the two groups and in January 1992, the appellant Campbell, with the help of the appellant Shirose, agreed to pay $270,000 for 50 kilograms of cannabis resin. The retail value of these drugs at street level, as found by the trial judge, was close to $1 million. Instead of receiving the expected 50 kilograms of cannabis resin in exchange for payment, however, the appellants were arrested and charged with conspiracy to traffic in cannabis resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking. 5In advance of the trial, to support their submission that if convicted, the proceedings should be stayed, the appellants sought to subpoena Mr. Leising from the Department of Justice to testify about the communications that had occurred with Cpl. Reynolds with respect to the legality of the reverse sting operation. The trial judge quashed the subpoena on the grounds that the communications were protected by solicitor-client privilege and did not fall within one of the recognized exceptions.",

And then to return to Officer Plomp's certificate, the last thing he said is, \"and the issue of entrapment.\" Was that one of the items on the agenda with Mr. Leising? Yes, sir. The Crown successfully objected to counsel for the appellants questioning Cpl. Reynolds with respect to the actual advice given because of the claim of solicitor-client privilege. The appellants' counsel then attempted to use this objection to narrow the potential ambit of the Crown's \"good faith\" argument: So it is my respectful submission that the Crown certainly cannot argue that the police acted in good faith because they acted on legal advice, because we don't know what legal advice they got. We don't know what qualifications or conditions were attached. We don't know whether they were told, 'This is going to be illegal and you're on your own. You're at risk.' We don't know if they were told, 'It's illegal but don't worry, we'll never prosecute you.'",

    "text": "2On October 13, 1994 a chlor-alkali plant operated by the respondents (collectively referred to as \"CanadianOxy\") in North Vancouver, British Columbia discharged a quantity of chlorine into the waters of Burrard Inlet, killing a number of fish. This incident occurred during a three and a half hour power outage at the plant, as a result of one of two B.C. Hydro 60 kv power lines servicing the plant being struck by a tree. 3The company reported the discharge to the authorities and an investigation by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans followed. Fishery Officer Robert Tompkins went to the plant that night, spoke with the Plant Chemist, and seized a number of documents. He also seized samples of dead fish recovered in the vicinity of the plant by the Harbour Master's patrol vessel. He advised the Plant Manager that he had reasonable grounds to believe that an offence had been committed under theFisheries Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-14. 4Over a short time Tompkins made three further visits to the plant, formally interviewed the Plant Chemist, was shown the valve which the company had identified as the cause of the discharge and was provided with certain documents. His request to interview additional employees was refused. 5Tompkins subsequently made a written request to CanadianOxy's counsel for additional technical information believed relevant for Environment Canada's Pollution Abatement Division to assess whether the discharge had been preventable. Only a few of these questions were answered. 6On March 16, 1995, five months after the discharge, Tompkins swore an information and obtained a warrant to search the respondents' plant for a range of documents relating to process records, plant maintenance, employee training, discipline, and general plant operations. In the information, Tompkins described the reasons for seeking this information: The business records . . . are required to establish and prove that CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. . . . operate a chlor‐alkali plant that discharges effluent to the waters of Burrard Inlet near North Vancouver, B.C., that the release of effluent with a chlorine concentration exceeding 10 ppm, which I know would be acutely lethal to fish, occurred on October 13, 1994, and that the company could have taken additional reasonable measures to prevent the release of a deleterious substance into water frequented by fish.... . . .",

It is necessary to examine effluent discharge records, effluent water quality sampling and analysis records, mechanical and instrument maintenance records, environmental control records, instrument calibration records and flow rate calculation records covering an extended period of time before and after October 13, 1994.

In total 139 items were seized pursuant to the warrant, and 73 additional items were seized under the investigators' understanding of the \"plain view\" doctrine. Following the search, Tompkins learned by coincidence of an adverse ruling by a British Columbia Provincial Court judge on the validity of a similar seizure in an unrelated case. As a result, he sought legal advice with respect to a number of the items taken. 8On April 26, 1995, Tompkins made two applications to a Justice of the Peace, one for an order to return the documents which had been improperly seized under the first warrant, and the second for a new warrant to re-seize 13 of the items returned which were relevant to the investigation. These orders were granted and executed the same day. 9On June 15, 1995 the respondents were charged with: (a) depositing, or permitting the deposit, of a deleterious substance in waters frequented by fish, contrary toss. 36(3)and40(2)of theFisheries Act; and (b) introducing, or causing or allowing the introduction of waste into the environment, contrary to ss. 3(1.1) and 34(3) of theWaste Management Act, S.B.C. 1982, c. 41 (now R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 482). 10The respondents subsequently brought a motion to quash the warrants alleging thats. 487(1)of theCriminal Codehad been exceeded.",

The appellant had planned to take his sons out to dinner and a movie, but abandoned these plans because of his wife's objection. The appellant instead visited briefly with his sons. His wife waited in the truck. According to the appellant, his wife accelerated her attack on him upon his return to the driver's seat. She taunted him that his former wife had been \"fucking all my friends\" (while the two had been married) and that \"[my sons] weren't my kids at all\". As the verbal abuse continued, he said, \"I can see she's losing it\", so he pulled into a vacant lot and \"she's still yelling at me that I'm nothing but a piece of shit\". His wife then allegedly said she had told the police that he had been abusing her and that they were about to arrest him, and threatened to get a court order to force him out of their home leaving her in the house, collecting alimony and child support. He says she told him that she felt sick every time he touched her, that he was a \"lousy fuck\" with a small penis, and that she would never have sex with him again. As stated, a psychological report filed by the defence at trial characterized the comments attributed to Mrs. Stone as \"exceptionally cruel, psychologically sadistic, and profoundly rejecting\". 9The appellant finally pulled off the highway in Burnaby to a vacant lot and described sitting in the truck with his head down, listening to his wife, and thinking that he and his boys did not deserve to be treated this way and \"it's just kind of fading away\". From there, he said, he remembered only a \"whooshing\" sensation washing over him, from his feet to his head. According to his account, when subsequently his eyes focussed, he was staring straight ahead and felt something in his hand. He looked down and saw his wife slumped over on the seat.",

On January 2, 1981, Prince was charged with the attempted murder of Daniels. On January 6, 1981, Daniels gave birth to a child who lived for 19 minutes and then died. The cause of death is alleged to be traceable to the stabbing. The autopsy report indicated that the knife penetrated the amniotic sac, causing contamination of the amniotic fluid which in turn caused the child's premature birth. Because the fetus was not sufficiently developed, the child died. 3.Between December 7, 1981, and January 4, 1982, Prince was tried and acquitted of the attempted murder of Daniels but was convicted on a charge of causing bodily harm to Daniels. An appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal in respect of her conviction and sentence (six months imprisonment) was dismissed on October 20, 1982. 4.In the meantime, on July 1, 1981, following an inquest into the death of the child, and following Prince's committal for trial on the charge of attempted murder of Daniels, Prince was charged with manslaughter of the child as follows: THAT she, the said SANDRA PRINCE, between the thirty‐first day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty, and the seventh day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty‐one, both dates inclusive, at the City of Winnipeg, in the Eastern Judicial District, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully cause death to the unnamed male child of Bernice Daniels, and did thereby commit manslaughter. A preliminary inquiry regarding this charge was held in February, 1982, and Prince was committed to stand trial. On April 29, 1983, Prince's lawyer made a preliminary motion to the trial judge, Barkman Co. Ct. J., requesting him to enter a stay of proceedings on the basis of the principle inKienapple v.

New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480, at para. 15. These facts have been broken into two categories: legislative and adjudicative. InDanson,supra, at p. 1099, Sopinka J., for the Court, outlined these categories as follows: These terms derive from Davis,Administrative Law Treatise(1958), vol. 2, para. 15.03, p. 353. (See also Morgan, \"Proof of Facts in Charter Litigation\", in Sharpe, ed.,Charter Litigation(1987).) Adjudicative facts are those that concern the immediate parties: in Davis' words, \"who did what, where, when, how, and with what motive or intent ....\" Such facts are specific, and must be proved by admissible evidence. Legislative facts are those that establish the purpose and background of legislation, including its social, economic and cultural context. Such facts are of a more general nature, and are subject to less stringent admissibility requirements: see e.g.,Re Anti-Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373,perLaskin C.J., at p. 391;Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714,perDickson J. (as he then was), at p. 723; andReference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297,perMcIntyre J., at p. 318. 39The argument that the present appeal is premature rests on the contention that there are few adjudicative facts before the Court. Two points may be made in response. 40First, it is not clear what further adjudicative facts would arise if the respondent had gone through the impugned procedure and been refused production. Although, pursuant tos. 278.8(1)of theCriminal Code, the trial judge must provide reasons for refusing to order production of any record, or part of any record, presumably these reasons could not divulge much about the content of the records in question for that would defeat the very purpose of the new provisions. 41Second, the record contains sufficient facts to resolve the issues posed by the present appeal.",

Accordingly, the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent has no air of reality. 99I note that O'Neill J.A. also dissented on the grounds that the trial judge failed to consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent in the cases of T.R. and D.A.S. The appellant, however, made no submissions on this point in either oral or written arguments. It is not clear whether this was an oversight, or a concession that there was no air of reality to the defence in either case and thus a waiver of this ground of appeal. To rule out the possibility of a potentially harmful oversight and in an abundance of caution, I have reviewed the record, and am of the opinion that there was no air of reality to the defence. The issue was simply one of consent or no consent in both cases. E.Did the trial judge err in his application of the principle of reasonable doubt in the cases of all five complainants? 100The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in his application of the principle of reasonable doubt to each of the charges against him in the cases of all five complainants. O'Neill J.A. in dissent held that the trial judge made two notable errors. First, in each case the trial judge failed to consider all of the evidence in determining whether there was a reasonable doubt in the manner set out by this Court's decision inR. v. W. (D.),supra. Second, that in the cases of D.A.S. and T.R., the trial judge used language that suggests that he reversed the onus on the burden of proof from the Crown to the appellant. 101At the beginning of his judgment, before dealing with any of the individual charges, the trial judge specifically referred toW. (D.).At paras. 3-5 he held: . . . it is important to ensure that one applies the presumption of innocence to the accused in each of the cases. The obligation is never lifted from the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on each of the counts.",

It has been pointed out in numerous cases that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is that degree of proof which \"convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience that the Crown has proven all the essential elements of the offence\": seeR. v. W. (D.). . . . It has been said by a number of trial judges that it is incorrect to approach these cases in terms of whether or not one believes the defence's evidence or the Crown's evidence. The correct approach is to ask oneself; even if I do not believe the evidence of the accused, whether or not, viewing the evidence as a whole, I have a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt. . . . It is important to review all of the testimony and consider the evidence in its totality in the broader context of the presumption of innocence and the requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to finally reach a decision on each count. 102The trial judge clearly directed himself properly as to the principle of reasonable doubt. His judgment also reveals a thorough review of the evidence. While he did not specifically advert toW. (D.)while dealing with each count, this does not mean that he erred. I agree with Green J.A. who held at pp. 325-26: . . . the trial judge, near the beginning of his reasons for judgment, when dealing with general principles, specifically referred to and properly stated, the effect ofR. v. W.as it affects the application of the principle of reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility. The fact that he did not repeat the admonition each time as he dealt with the facts of each count does not necessarily mean that he failed to consider or apply the principle in each case. Just because a judge, after considering the evidence, decides to accept a complainant's version of events over that of an accused's does not mean he has fallen into the trap whichR. v. W.warns against. 103With respect to the cases of T.R. and D.A.S., in the course of reviewing the evidence, the trial judge said that he was \"not convinced\" that the complainants consented to the sexual activity in question.",

This is especially true in the case of a judge sitting alone where other comments made by him or her may make it perfectly clear that he or she did not misapprehend the import of the legal principles involved.

(3d) 171, the Ontario Court of Appeal was faced with a verdict rejecting purportedly uncontradicted expert evidence. Lacourcière J.A., speaking for the court, stated at p. 177: This Court is not at liberty to come to its own conclusion on the issue of insanity and thereby disregard the verdict pronounced by a jury. Having regard to the statutory presumption of sanity, this Court ought not to interfere with the verdict of a jury unless on consideration of all the evidence, we are satisfied that it was one which no jury acting judicially and properly instructed could have reached. . . . However, there has to be a rational foundation, in the evidence, for the jury to reasonably reject the opinion of the experts. InMailloux, two eminent forensic psychiatrists had expressed the opinion that the appellant suffered from a paranoid personality disorder dating back to a period well before the shooting. Lacourcière J.A. summarized more precisely the purport of their evidence at p. 173: Both psychiatrists testified that the [accused] at the material time, by reason of psychotic delusions, was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts and of knowing that his acts were wrong. They also agreed that the [accused] was incapable of forming the specific intent necessary to commit murder. However, the opinions expressed in their evidence-in-chief were substantially qualified and diluted by the evidence which they gave during cross-examination, which was obviously accepted by the jury, to the effect that the [accused] knew that pulling the trigger would cause the gun to fire and that he was able to appreciate the nature and quality of the act and to understand the immediate physical consequence which would flow from it,i.e., that someone would be killed.",

    "text": "In particular, Dr. Orchard admitted in cross-examination that first the [accused] was capable of knowing that the act was wrong and was also capable of forming the specific intent to kill. 9The appellant had submitted that the verdict of murder was unreasonable in light of the uncontradicted psychiatric opinions coupled with the evidence of drug abuse, the absence of motive and the bizarre nature of the accused's conduct before and after the shooting. The Court of Appeal did not accept that argument and concluded at p. 177: Dealing first with our power to substitute a verdict under s. 613(1)(d), there certainly was ample evidence upon which the jury could properly return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. However, we are satisfied that the evidence was also capable of reasonably supporting the jury's conclusion, according to the view which they took of it, that the defence of insanity had not been proved by the accused on the balance of probabilities. Mailloux,supra, was affirmed by this Court . Lamer J. (as he then was) stated at p. 1044: Stated in technical terms, the finding by the jury was that the accused had not rebutted by a preponderance of evidence the presumption of sanity. After reviewing the evidence, I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal's finding that there was evidence supportive of the jury's conclusion and that the verdict, in that regard, was not unreasonable. 10A proper understanding and weighing of expert opinion often plays a central role in the determination of whether or not an accused should be found not guilty by reason of mental disorder. The absence of a Crown rebuttal expert to contradict an accused's psychiatric evidence is not in itself sufficient to conclude that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable if that conclusion remained reasonably open to the jury on the totality of the evidence. However, it may be unreasonable for a jury to disregard the expert evidence put before it, particularly where all the experts called were in agreement with each other, when their evidence was \"uncontradicted and not seriously challenged\" (R.v.Kelly(1971), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 186 (Ont. C.A.),at p. 186), and when there was nothing in the \"conduct of the commission of the crime which would raise any serious question as to the validity of the psychiatrists' conclusion\" (Kelly, at p. 186).",

It happened, she said, on numerous occasions when he entered her bedroom, either at night, or at other times and in other locations when they were alone. She further testified that the inappropriate conduct culminated in June 1984, when the appellant sexually assaulted her by having non-consensual sexual intercourse. The complainant left home that day. She first complained to the police about these incidents in 1994, when she was a mature and married woman and had lived away from home for over a decade. 7The \"fresh\" evidence to be considered on this appeal is an audio-taped conversation between J.W. and her mother, M.B., in which J.W. denied that she had been sexually molested by the appellant. The recording was surreptitiously taped by M.B. in 1984, a few days after J.W.'s departure from home. Ten years later, when the complainant brought her story to the police, M.B. gave the tape to the appellant's lawyer. The tape remained in his possession throughout the trial. 8Trial counsel chose not to introduce the tape in evidence. Instead, he raised questions about the contents of the tape on cross-examination of the complainant who was not aware that the tape existed. The complainant denied having had any contact with her mother, M.B., until about three months after she had left home permanently. She had no specific recollection of the detailed conversation which was put to her in cross-examination at the trial. 9The appellant did not testify. The appellant's spouse M.B. testified and contradicted the complainant's evidence about the conversation, which she said occurred shortly after the complainant left home. She said that the complainant came with her boyfriend to collect her clothes and that the conversation occurred at that time. During the conversation, M.B. attempted to find out why the complainant had left home. Although at trial M.B. did not give a verbatim report of the questions and answers, she stated that she asked the complainant on several occasions whether the appellant had assaulted or molested her and, each time, the complainant denied having been assaulted in any manner.",

On October 16, 1995, he was released on his own recognizance which required that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour for twelve months and that he not initiate any contact or communication with the alleged assault victims. The appellant was subsequently charged with breach of the condition that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was detained in custody on November 22, 1995, and subsequently appeared in the Provincial Court of Newfoundland, Youth Court Division, on November 23, 1995 at which time the matter was put over to January 4, 1996 for the purpose of entering a plea. Eventually, despite several adjournments, the Crown did not present any evidence and the charges were dismissed. 3The appellant's complaint relates to the distribution of the Youth Court docket for January 4, 1996 to two school boards in the City of St. John's. The docket was sent to the school psychologists who treated the information contained in the docket in accordance with the scheme set out in s. 38(1.14) and (1.15). Other persons within the school system were only informed on a need-to-know basis. The point, however, is that the distribution clearly wasnotlimited to the one school board that was responsible for a school attended by each of the young people on the docket. A board does not have a cognizable interest in students or non-students for whom it has no responsibility whatsoever. 4The routine distribution of the Youth Court docket was undertaken by the Youth Court staff on the recommendation of its \"Youth Justice Concerns Committee\". This Committee includes representatives from Legal Aid, the Crown Attorney's office, the Department of Health -- Mental Health Division, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, the RCMP, youth corrections, school boards, child welfare, and, occasionally, the Federation of School Boards and Trustees. The Committee is, as its name suggests, a purely advisory body with no statutory powers or duties. Although a Youth Court judge is a member of the Committee, it is common ground that when sitting on the Committee he is not exercising his powers as a Youth Court judge.",

At this point, I will simply give an overview. 4Between February 5, 1994 and April 4, 1995, a series of eight fires involving four buildings and two motor vehicles occurred in and around the community of Waterville, Nova Scotia. Most of the incidents occurred between 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. The vehicle fires involved a van belonging to the respondent's father, and a car belonging to the respondent's fiancée, Tanya Kilcup. The building fires occurred relatively close to where the respondent had lived when the various fires occurred. The fires appeared to have been deliberately set, with the possible exception of Ms. Kilcup's vehicle. The respondent was a member of the Waterville Volunteer Fire Brigade, and had responded to each of the fires in that capacity. 5The last fire involved Ms. Kilcup's vehicle. The car was parked in the driveway of the apartment building where the respondent and Ms. Kilcup lived. The fire was discovered by a passerby who extinguished it. The Fire Marshall investigated the fire and concluded that since the car was subject to a prior recall for a possible faulty ignition switch, the fire may have been accidental owing to an electrical fault. 6The police also conducted an extensive investigation of the fires. To help narrow the list of possible suspects, they asked a total of seven or eight individuals to submit to polygraph tests. Five or six individuals did so, passed the test, and were effectively removed from the list of suspects. Another person had agreed to take a polygraph, but was not examined after the respondent confessed to the crimes. The respondent, after initial doubts, agreed to submit to a test. Around 3:00 p.m. on April 26, 1995, the respondent went to the Wandlyn Motel for the test, according to a prior arrangement. The police audiotaped the events at the motel. Sergeant Taker administered the polygraph test. The respondent was fully advised of his rights to silence, to a lawyer (including the availability of Legal Aid), and to leave at any time. Sergeant Taker also advised him that while Sergeant Taker's interpretation of the polygraph results was not admissible, anything said by the respondent was admissible.",

The respondent was given a pamphlet to review, which discussed the polygraph procedures, and he signed a consent form. 7Before conducting the test itself, Sergeant Taker conducted a lengthy \"pre-test\" interview, which involved a variety of questions, many of them personal in nature. This interview was designed to provide a basis for the polygraph test itself, to help Sergeant Taker compose \"control questions\" for the polygraph exam, and to foster a sense of intimacy between examiner and subject. An exculpatory statement, which formed the basis for the polygraph test itself, was taken at the conclusion of the pre-test. Sergeant Taker then conducted the polygraph exam, which lasted only a matter of minutes. During the test Sergeant Taker did not ask about any specific fire, but instead asked if the respondent's earlier statement had been truthful. At the conclusion of the test, around 5:00 p.m., Taker checked the charts and informed the respondent that he had failed the test. He reminded the respondent that his rights were still in effect, and proceeded to question him for approximately one hour. At one point the respondent asked \"What if I admit to the car? ... Then I can walk out of here and it's over.\" Though Sergeant Taker replied \"You can walk out at any time\", the respondent did not leave. 8At 6:30 p.m. Sergeant Taker was relieved by Corporal Deveau, who reminded the respondent of his right to counsel. After 30 to 40 minutes, the respondent confessed to setting fire to his fiancée's car. He appeared emotionally distraught at this time. After a recitation of his rights, and an acknowledgement that he understood them, the police took a written statement, in which he continued to deny any involvement in the other fires. The respondent was arrested, warned of his right to counsel, given the secondary police warning, and driven to the police station at 8:15 p.m. En route he was very upset and was crying. He was placed in an interview room equipped with videotaping facilities, which recorded the subsequent interrogation where Corporal Deveau questioned him about the other fires.",

He was informed that he was under arrest, and he could call a lawyer if he wanted, but that he could not go home. Questioning did not cease. 9Constable Bogle took over the interrogation at 9:52 p.m., after giving the respondent the secondary police warning. Constable Bogle questioned the respondent until about 11:00 p.m., at which time the respondent confessed to setting seven of the eight fires. He denied any involvement in the fire in his father's van. At this time, Constable Bogle left the room, and the respondent was seen crying with his head in his hands. Constable Bogle returned with Corporal Deveau, and took a written statement. The respondent'sCharterrights and the police warning were on the statement, and were acknowledged by the respondent. The police warning stated that \"[y]ou need not say anything. You have nothing to hope from any promise or favour and nothing to fear from any threat whether or not you do say anything. Anything you do say may be used as evidence.\" The statement concluded at 1:10 a.m. on April 27. After the police attended to various administrative tasks, the respondent was placed in a cell to sleep at 2:45 a.m. At 6:00 a.m., Corporal Deveau noticed that the respondent was awake and asked whether he would agree to a re-enactment. On the tape of the re-enactment, the respondent was given aCharterwarning, the secondary warning, and was advised that he could stop the re-enactment at any time.

The respondent was charged with seven counts of arson. 10At trial, the trial judge held avoir direto determine the admissibility of the respondent's statements, including the video re-enactment. The trial judge ruled that the statements were voluntary and admissible, and subsequently convicted him on all counts.

At the time of the offence, he was 35 years old. He had no prior criminal record. He had a drinking problem from the age of 14 until his early 30s. He stopped drinking when he entered a relationship with the victim's sister, Anita Teed. When they broke up, the appellant started drinking again. 4One such occasion was on May 14, 1996. On that day, the appellant was drinking with his friend, Adrian Teed, and Mr. Teed's father, Karl Staples, at the house of Mr. Teed's mother, Essie. The three men left the house together and travelled to the Teeds' isolated camp in the woods. There, the three continued to drink, and the appellant began taking prescription drugs, including Valium. While Mr. Staples was inside the cabin, the appellant and Mr. Teed successfully cut off a length of a rifle barrel. The appellant told Mr. Teed that the gun was to be used to commit a robbery, but alleges that, in fact, he had intended to kill himself with the weapon. The appellant testified that he wanted to commit suicide as a result of severe depression from a recent breakup with Mr. Teed's sister, Anita. The trial judge accepted that, at the time, the appellant was quite distraught. It was also accepted that he was very intoxicated. 5While Mr. Teed remained at the camp, the appellant drove Mr. Staples home. Upon returning to the camp, the appellant found Mr. Teed lying in the top bunk in the cabin. While holding the rifle which he knew to be loaded, the appellant jumped up to the lower bunk in order to shake Mr. Teed – either to awaken him, or to get his attention. As might be expected in this state of intoxication, the appellant lost his footing while he jumped, and he fell. The gun discharged, and the bullet struck Mr. Teed in the head, killing him instantly. The gun was not susceptible to shock discharge.",

There was no evidence that the appellant intended to aim the gun at the victim. 6The appellant dragged Mr. Teed's body out of the cabin to a point in the woods approximately five kilometres away from the cabin, and covered it with a blanket. The appellant then drove to Essie Teed's house. He pointed the gun at Mr. Teed's mother, telling her to be quiet and to sit down. He told her he had already killed one person that night. Teed calmed the appellant down, and took the rifle from him. The appellant stated that he wanted to kill himself. In order to calm the appellant down further, Mrs. Teed took the accused to see the victim's sister, Anita Teed. 7After this meeting, Essie Teed returned the rifle to the appellant, and told him to not bring it around anymore. The appellant disposed of the rifle in a river. The following day, he allegedly attempted to commit suicide by setting the cabin on fire while remaining inside. Forty-five minutes later, he admitted himself into the psychiatric ward of a local hospital, where he confessed to killing Mr. Teed. The appellant has always been very remorseful. At trial, the appellant pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing death, contrary tos. 220(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‐46, and unlawfully pointing a firearm, contrary to s. 86 of theCode. 8Both Anita Teed and Essie Teed feared for their safety after the incident, and this formed the basis of the probation officer's pre-sentencing report recommendation that community supervision would be inappropriate. The appellant spent five months in pre-trial custody. At his sentencing, the appellant challenged the constitutional validity of the minimum sentence imposed pursuant tos. 220(a) of theCriminal Code. The trial judge found that the provision violateds. 12of theCharter, and sentenced the appellant to two years' imprisonment for the criminal negligence charge (taking into account pre-trial custody), and one year consecutive for the unlawful pointing of a firearm charge. The Crown appealed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and imposed a four-year sentence on the appellant, without any credit for pre-trial custody.",

    "text": "54Threshold reliability exists where there is a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. It does not mean that the hearsay is true or even likely to be true, but rather it asks whether the circumstances are such that there is sufficient reliability for the hearsay to be properly assessed by the jury. The traditional hearsay exceptions are based on a determination of threshold reliability:Smith,supra, at pp. 929-30. These exceptions have historically been founded on truisms common to classes of people or common to circumstances applicable to all people. There is no reason why that should not continue to be the case. 55I acknowledge that some of the existing exceptions may require fine tuning. It may be that society has changed in such a manner that the rationale for the exception no longer applies. And, there may be circumstances which could arise in an individual case which challenge the inherent reliability that underpins a hearsay exception. However, the court must differentiate between individual circumstances that go to the weight of the evidence (such as motive to lie or other extraneous circumstances unique to the individual) and circumstances that are properly considered at the threshold stage. 56In re-evaluating a hearsay exception, the court must ask whether some reason exists to doubt that the rationale underlying the exception applies in certain circumstances. The scope of this inquiry is restricted; the court should not consider every possible permutation of indicators of reliability or unreliability. To do so would result in the excision of the categories and abolition of their utility. Rather, the questions should always be: Is there something wrong with the exception itself? Should the exception be inapplicable in some circumstances? 57The only time when a court should entertain a challenge to an existing exception is where there are facts, generally applicable to a class of persons, which weaken the theoretical justification for the exception. If facts arise which demonstrate that within an exception, we no longer think that statements made by a particular class of persons are inherently reliable, then to a certain extent, the rationale for the exception has been displaced and the exception must be modified to exclude people in such circumstances.",

    "text": "For example, it may be that a court may wish to reconsider the dying declaration under certain circumstances such as when a dying person is under the influence of powerful drugs. Another exemption that may benefit from re-examination is the business records exception where the records are written by persons who are not disinterested parties. Both of these examples reflect particular circumstances under which reliability may be questioned for all people in such a situation. I believe that this approach will force the courts to reconsider the exceptions only where a problem exists with the theoretical foundation of the exception. Furthermore, having the courts remember the reasons for the rule will prove very beneficial. The problem with the exceptions was that they were thought to be \"ossified judicially created categories\" (Smith,supra, at p. 930), but this approach will foster a renewed understanding of the rationales underlying these categories. 58In sum, if one wishes to displace an exception, which is based on concepts of necessity and reliability, one will have to displace either necessity or the reliability upon which the exception is based. This can only be done where the circumstances would be generally applicable to a class of persons or in a particular circumstance faced by all persons. 59In principle, the trial judge's residual discretion to exclude admissible evidence where its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value (Seaboyer,supra, at p. 611) could, in appropriate circumstances, apply to evidence falling within an exception to the hearsay rule: see, e.g.,Hawkins,supra, at para. 85. This point was not addressed in the Court of Appeal and was not argued before this Court and therefore I see no need to undertake an analysis of the issue. 60I would summarize my position in the following terms which I believe are largely consistent with the approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal inR. v. Chahley(1992),72 C.C.C. (3d) 193, andR. v. Collins(1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 514.

The complainant told no one about these events for two and a half years. In January 1995, the complainant had a conversation with a school friend about \"gross\" things, some of which were true and some of which were false. During the conversation, the complainant told her friend about the assaults. The friend reported the complainant's disclosure to a teacher, and the matter was referred to the Children's Aid Society. A Society worker interviewed the complainant in the presence of a police officer. The complainant first said that she could not remember any sexual touching, but later revealed incidents involving the accused. The accused categorically denies the allegations. 4Charges were laid and the matter proceeded to trial. At the time of the trial the complainant was 10 years old. Defence counsel cross-examined the complainant on why she had waited so long to report the incidents and suggested that she had fabricated the story to \"one up\" the stories told by her friend. In response, the Crown sought to call child psychologist Dr. Peter Marshall to rebut defence counsel's submission that the lateness of the complainant's disclosure supported an inference that she was not telling the truth when she said that the accused had sexually assaulted her. The trial judge called avoir direon the admissibility of Dr. Marshall's evidence on this point. 5During thevoir dire, Dr. Marshall discussed delayed disclosure of child sexual abuse, based on his knowledge of the scientific literature in the area. He testified that there are many factors which can affect the timing of a complaint, including the relationship between the child and the abuser and the nature of the abuse. Some factors might discourage children from reporting abuse, such as embarrassment; fear of getting themselves or others into trouble; bribery or threats by the perpetrator; fear of being punished or sent away; disruption of the family; or fear that they would not be believed.",

He testified that children disclose at various lengths of time after the event, so there is a continuum from immediate disclosure to delayed disclosure to no disclosure. When cross-examined by defence counsel as to whether the profile of a victim of abuse could be developed by reference to the timing of the complaint, Dr. Marshall stated \"the fact of the delay . . . doesn't even enter into my thinking as to whether or not it happened.... [T]he research says that the length of time before a child reveals something is not diagnostic\". The trial judge asked him to clarify what it means when delay is \"not diagnostic\", to which Dr. Marshall responded \"[i]t proves nothing either way\". 7After Dr. Marshall testified, the trial judge asked defence counsel whether he took issue with Dr. Marshall's opinion that a delay in disclosure is not diagnostic. Defence counsel initially agreed that \"the delay is provable of nothing\". Crown counsel sought confirmation of that point, because \"the whole tenor of [defence counsel's] cross-examination of the complainant . . . was, If it happened you would have told somebody\". Defence counsel then stated that he intended to indicate to the jury that \"the fact that the victim did not tell anybody is certainly evidence that it didn't happen to her\".",

While these three individuals were in the shed located behind the house, they were surprised by David Fortier, aged thirteen. After grabbing him and tying him up, the respondent questioned him about the location of the safe and the people who were in the house. He put a shotgun cartridge in his mouth, which he then taped shut, and threatened him several times, both verbally and with his gun. The respondent then left the shed, taking David, with his gun pointed at the boy's head, and escorted him towards the house. The two accomplices followed. Once the respondent was inside the house, he attacked Bertrand Fortier, David's father, as he sat watching television with his wife. A fight broke out and a shot was fired in the fray. While this was going on, the two accomplices fled and one of the Fortier boys called the police. Mr. Fortier ultimately wrestled the respondent to the ground and the police arrived shortly afterward. 3On December 18, 1996, the respondent pleaded guilty to fifteen counts arising from the events of June 22, 1996. In appealing his sentence, the respondent is seeking to have three new reports admitted in evidence. The first, dated April 3, 1997, is entitled [translation] \"Psychological/psychiatric assessment report\". This report was prepared by Marc Daigle, a psychologist, for Correctional Service Canada. The second report was written by Louis Morissette, a psychiatrist, at the respondent's request. It is dated March 17, 1998. The appellant objects to the admission of these two reports in evidence, but consents to the admission of the third report, which is by Jacques Bigras, a psychologist. That report is dated March 31, 1998, and was prepared for Correctional Service Canada at the end of a course taken by the respondent during his incarceration.",

The respondent testified that at the time of the events, he was living with his current wife and her son. Because W. and L. did not get along well with his wife's son, the respondent had rented an apartment for them where they lived with a female friend, who looked after them at nights and during the weekends, and a babysitter who came in on weekdays. The respondent visited the apartment on a daily basis, took about half of his meals there and was often present during the weekends. 3On May 9, 1995, a child and youth protection centre received information alleging that L. had been sexually abused by the respondent. About a week later, the two children were removed from the respondent's custody and placed in a foster home. The foster mother did not know the respondent nor did she know why the children had been removed from his custody. She and her sister testified against the respondent at the trial. 1.Statements by the Children 4The foster mother testified that: (i) While giving a bath to the two children, she observed them rubbing their penises together. W. then started to hit L.'s buttock with his penis. On being questioned, the children said it was \"Papi\" who showed them to do that. (ii) Another time, W. told her that \"Papi\" had rubbed his \"coulout\" on his body, had [translation] \"wet his hair\", and that \"when papi finished doing that . . . he put hiscouloutin his behind\", and that when he had done doing that, there was blood in W's excrement. W. told her that this was painful and caused him to walk with difficulty. According to the foster mother, W. had tears in his eyes when he gave this account. \"Coulout\" is a slang word for penis. The foster mother said she had never heard the word until the child mentioned it. 5The sister of the foster mother also did not know the respondent. She testified that at one point she was watching television with the children.",

    "text": "She testified that at one point she was watching television with the children. During an episode in which two persons were kissing, W. blurted out a similar \"coulot\" story with the same details about blood and difficulties in walking. W. said that \"Papi\" would then clean up the excrement with some paper and that \"Papi's\" \"coulout\" is quite different than his: [translation] \"it's bigger and all hairy\". 6On October 24, 1995, Sergeant Binette asked W. who had put his \"coulout\" in his buttock. The child answered \"Papi J.\" and quickly identified the respondent as \"Papi J.\" when presented with pictures. 2.The Charges 7The respondent was charged with sexual offences in relation to both W. and L., including touching for a sexual purpose the body of a person under the age of 14 years, unlawful anal intercourse, and sexual assault. 3.The Examining Physicians 8Dr. Desmarchais, a pediatrist retained by the Crown, examined W. on July 24, 1995, more than two months after the children were removed from the respondent's custody. She observed a 1.5 cm lesion near the anus and thought that there was no doubt that the boy had been sodomized. On the other hand, Dr. Chabot, also a pediatrist who testified for the Crown, was equivocal. He examined W. on August 31, 1995. He said that while the scar was longer than one might expect from constipation, the injury was consistent with constipation as well as with sodomy. 4.The Excluded Evidence 9In the course of his trial, the respondent tendered the evidence of Dr. Édouard Beltrami, a qualified psychiatrist who works extensively in the field of clinical psychology. Dr. Beltrami's evidence was tendered to establish that in all probability a serious sexual deviant had inflicted anal intercourse on two children of that age, and no such deviant personality traits were disclosed in Dr. Beltrami's testing of the respondent. The Crown objected to the admission of this evidence and avoir direwas held. Dr. Beltrami testified in thevoir direas follows: (1) While it is not possible to establish a standard profile of individuals with a disposition to sodomize young children, such individuals [translation] \"frequently\" or \"habitually\" exhibited certain distinctive characteristics which could be identified.",

(2) The tests, which had been administered by Dr. Beltrami's assistant, but the results evaluated by Dr. Beltrami himself, consisted of two approaches, the first a series of general personality tests, and the second a test which Dr. Beltrami considered could detect individuals with serious sexual disorders. 10In the first set of tests, the respondent was asked a series of questions about his family history, his schooling, his work experiences, his emotional and sexual life, his hobbies and life habits. The \"Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Test Version 2\" (hereinafter \"MMPI2\") was also administered. The respondent's reactions, while being questioned, were monitored by electromyography (EMG), which measures anxiety. It acts as a sort of lie detector. The objective of the MMPI2 is to identify different potential personality characteristics, including the tendency to be truthful, to hide symptoms, to be subject to psychosis, to be depressive, to be hyperactive, to be anxious, to be histrionic, etc. These tests are not designed specifically for the detection of sexual disorders. 11The second and more controversial test was directed to the respondent's sexual preferences. It consisted of exposing him to images and sounds of sexual activity, both normal and deviant, and measuring his physiological reaction through a gauge attached to his penis. The \"strain gauge\" is designed to pick up signs of physical arousal. Dr. Beltrami explained that if the subject has previously derived pleasure from a specific form of sexual activity, the pleasure is imprinted on the brain, and may be restimulated on further exposure to pictures or sounds of similar activity. This is how he explained it to the court: [translation] Q. How do you . . . how is it done? The subject is shown normal and deviant images and is played normal and deviant audio cassettes. And those who have derived pleasure in the past from a deviant sexual activity, this . . . This test? A. . . . this pleasure is kind of ingrained in his brain in the form of an engram, to use the technical term . . . Okay, just to . . .",

The respondent was never confronted with specific images designed to replicate the offences alleged against him. 13Dr. Beltrami testified on thevoir direthat the first set of tests showed that the respondent had had an unexceptional childhood, that he had not been sexually abused, that he had a good education which allowed him to hold a responsible job and that he was ingenious and entrepreneurial. He noted that the respondent often maintained two or three intimate heterosexual relationships at the same time without his partners knowing about one another. There were several children from these various relationships. Dr. Beltrami notes [translation] \"He clearly exhibits judgment problems in his tumultuous emotional life. On the other hand, he does not seem to have the irrational ideas associated with sexual offences.\" Dr. Beltrami noted a tendency on the part of the respondent to deceive, but apart from some emotional instability with women, Dr. Beltrami concluded that the respondent did not have any particular pathologies. 14With respect to the plethysmograph test, Dr. Beltrami concluded that the respondent has [translation] \"a clearly normal profile with a preference for adult women and a slight attraction to adolescents. He exhibits no deviation in respect of boys in general or prepubescent boys\". 15The trial judge ruled Dr. Beltrami's evidence inadmissible. He acquitted the respondent of the charges related to L. but convicted the respondent ofhaving, for a sexual purpose, invited, counseled or incited W. to touch the body of the respondent, (s. 152of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.

The appellant's unstable and violent childhood explains in part how Jetté was able to make him his [translation] \"whipping boy\". 3The night of the murder, Jetté argued with his girlfriend and came over to Charlebois' apartment. Shortly thereafter, while the appellant's neighbour Alain Lalancette was still present, Jetté flicked a knife in front of the accused's face and said:[translation]\"Yea, we're going to have some fun tonight, you and me.\" 4Charlebois testified that his apprehension grew after Lalancette departed, particularly when Jetté noticed that the appellant actually had in his possession a firearm that he had refused to sell to Jetté on the pretense that he no longer had it. Nevertheless, Jetté said nothing about the rifle. After the accused's roommate came home, Jetté relaxed on the couch and told the appellant to go to sleep. 5The appellant testified that once in his bedroom, his panic became overwhelming. He got up, took the rifle, approached Jetté and shot him in the back of the head while he was sleeping. There was no argument, skirmish or threat. Immediately after the shooting, the accused phoned 911 and made up the following story about a physical altercation: [translation] . . . I've just committed a murder . . .

The incident giving rise to the charge occurred on July 27, 1995, when Kimberley Cahoon was shot in the neck and killed with a shotgun fired at close range. The shooting occurred in the kitchen of the home that the appellant shared with another man. At trial, the defence put forward the theory that the appellant's house-mate had killed Ms. Cahoon. This theory was grounded on the view that, given the appellant's state of intoxication combined with the consequences of a prior brain injury, the appellant could not have formed the intent to kill. 4The appellant appealed the conviction on the grounds,inter alia, that his rights to counsel and silence had been violated, that the trial judge had improperly instructed the jury on the issues of capacity and intent, and that the trial judge had misled the jury on the correct standard of proof.

Avetysan was tried jointly with Oleg Velitchko, who was convicted of the same offences and who discontinued his appeal to this Court before the release of this decision. Slivko Paval Valerievich (\"the complainant\") was a Russian citizen seeking refugee status in St. John's, Newfoundland. He testified that the appellant and Velitchko entered his apartment on October 17, 1996, and assaulted him over the course of two or three hours. According to the complainant, the appellant and Velitchko demanded that he pay $1,000 within three days; they threatened to kill him and harm his wife and child in Russia if he did not comply. 6The appellant and Velitchko, however, described a completely different version of events. In their account, they were invited into the apartment where they had a friendly conversation about immigration, sports and unemployment. The appellant and Velitchko said no assault took place and no threats were made. The jury convicted the appellant and Velitchko. 7The trial judge's charge to the jury was given prior to the 1997Lifchusdecision. He told the jury: The presumption of innocence — In a criminal case in this country, the accused is presumed to be innocent until the Crown has proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not the responsibility of the accused to establish or demonstrate or prove their innocence. If the Crown fails to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, you must acquit the accused. What is reasonable doubt? A reasonable doubt is just that, a doubt that is reasonable. I usually describe it as a real doubt, if you got a real doubt, a serious doubt. It is not an imaginary doubt or a fictitious doubt which is used by a person to avoid their responsibility. Later in his charge, the trial judge said: So the evidence, members of the jury, is fairly — It's not a complex matter. It's fairly simple and straightforward. What it boils down to, are you satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this man was threatened and assaulted in his apartment that evening? You assess the evidence, all of the evidence.

    "text": "6The appellant, Robert Latimer, farmed in Wilkie, Saskatchewan. His 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, suffered a severe form of cerebral palsy. She was quadriplegic and her physical condition rendered her immobile. She was bedridden for much of the time. Her condition was a permanent one, caused by neurological damage at the time of her birth. Tracy was said to have the mental capacity of a four-month-old baby, and she could communicate only by means of facial expressions, laughter and crying. She was completely dependent on others for her care. Tracy suffered seizures despite the medication she took. It was thought she experienced a great deal of pain, and the pain could not be reduced by medication since the pain medication conflicted with her anti-epileptic medication and her difficulty in swallowing. Tracy experienced five to six seizures daily. She had to be spoon-fed, and her lack of nutrients caused weight loss. 7There was evidence that Tracy could have been fed with a feeding tube into her stomach, an option that would have improved her nutrition and health, and that might also have allowed for more effective pain medication to be administered. The Latimers rejected the feeding-tube option as being intrusive and as representing the first step on a path to preserving Tracy's life artificially. 8Tracy had a serious disability, but she was not terminally ill. Her doctors anticipated that she would have to undergo repeated surgeries, her breathing difficulties had increased, but her life was not in its final stages. 9Tracy enjoyed music, bonfires, being with her family and the circus. She liked to play music on a radio, which she could use with a special button. Tracy could apparently recognize family members and she would express joy at seeing them. Tracy also loved being rocked gently by her parents. 10Tracy underwent numerous surgeries in her short lifetime. In 1990, surgery tried to balance the muscles around her pelvis. In 1992, it was used to reduce the abnormal curvature in her back. 11Like the majority of totally involved, quadriparetic children with cerebral palsy, Tracy had developed scoliosis, an abnormal curvature and rotation in the back, necessitating surgery to implant metal rods to support her spine.",

    "text": "While it was a successful procedure, further problems developed in Tracy's right hip: it became dislocated and caused her considerable pain. 12Tracy was scheduled to undergo further surgery on November 19, 1993. This was to deal with her dislocated hip and, it was hoped, to lessen her constant pain. The procedure involved removing her upper thigh bone, which would leave her lower leg loose without any connecting bone; it would be held in place only by muscle and tissue. The anticipated recovery period for this surgery was one year. 13The Latimers were told that this procedure would cause pain, and the doctors involved suggested that further surgery would be required in the future to relieve the pain emanating from various joints in Tracy's body. According to the appellant's wife, Laura Latimer, further surgery was perceived as mutilation. As a result, Robert Latimer formed the view that his daughter's life was not worth living. 14In the weeks leading up to Tracy's death, the Latimers looked into the option of placing Tracy in a group home in North Battleford. She had lived there between July and October of 1993, just prior to her death, while her mother was pregnant. The Latimers applied to place Tracy in the home in October, but later concluded they were not interested in permanently placing her in that home at that time. 15On October 12, 1993, after learning that the doctors wished to perform this additional surgery, the appellant decided to take his daughter's life. On Sunday, October 24, 1993, while his wife and Tracy's siblings were at church, Robert Latimer carried Tracy to his pickup truck, seated her in the cab, and inserted a hose from the truck's exhaust pipe into the cab. She died from the carbon monoxide. 16The police conducted an autopsy and discovered carbon monoxide in her blood. The appellant at first maintained that Tracy simply passed away in her sleep. He later confessed to having taken her life, and gave a statement to the investigating police and partially re-enacted his actions on videotape. Mr. Latimer also told police that he had considered giving Tracy an overdose of Valium, or \"shooting her in the head\". 17Mr. Latimer has been convicted of murder twice in this case.",

He shouted at the respondent and the female resident but neither of them acknowledged the shouts. Mr. Barry testified he saw the female resident grip the complainant, seat her in the car and lift her knees and shut the door. He saw the respondent reach over the seat and lock the door. The respondent was observed giving the female resident $20. Mr. Barry reported the incident to his supervisors who called the police. Despite a search effort it took over seven hours to find the complainant. When she was found, both she and the respondent were still in the same car, now located in a remote coastal area at about 2:35 the next morning. 1.Complainant's Physical Injuries 32The police arrested the respondent. On driving the complainant back to the Waterford Hospital, the constable noted her shorts were on backwards, her underpants were hanging over the top of her shorts and she had bruises on her left cheek and left hand. There were scratches on her arms and legs. Subsequent examination did not disclose any semen or sperm on the complainant or on her clothes. 2.Complainant's Out-of-Court Statements 33The complainant made statements to police at the time of her being found, as well as to the doctor who first examined her. She repeatedly pointed to her injuries and stated \"Man did it, bad man, man in car, patient\". Police also conducted a videotaped interview the following day. She was questioned for 15 minutes in the presence of two nurses who had known and worked with her. She was asked about the marks on her hands, arm and face to which, in halting broken sentences, she replied that a man \"in handcuffs\" did it and that he should be \"put in jail\". She said that it happened \"last night\" and that he was wearing glasses and a black hat.",

She also communicated the facts that he scratched her in the car and that he smacked her. 3.Trial Evidence 34The case was tried by a judge sitting alone. He heard from a number of fact witnesses, concluding with Ms. Marlene Miller, a psychiatric nurse at the Waterford Hospital who had known the complainant for about 10 years. Latterly she was responsible for coordinating all of the complainant's care. She described the complainant's personal habits, medications and mental abilities in some detail. Of particular relevance are the following questions and answers: What about her responsiveness to questions? She could respond, you know, like if you asked her if she was hungry, yes, but stuff like to get details, she didn't give a lot of details of where she'd been or what she did, mostly only one sentence answers. ... Without getting into what was said, did you at any time, attempt to discuss with [the complainant] what had happened to her on that weekend? Were you able to determine what had happened without getting into exactly what was said, were you able to– A. Was that in the company of anybody else? I'm sure it probably was at times, there were actually a couple of times that she brought it up but it wasn't like in a lot of detail, you know, it was just simple sentences but it left no doubt. 35At the conclusion of Nurse Miller's testimony, defence counsel indicated that he would oppose aKhanapplication to substitute the complainant's out-of-court statements for her direct testimony. His position was that the out-of-court statements were unreliable and theKhanprocedure was unnecessary in light of the complainant's availability to testify in person. 4.The Voir Dire 36Crown counsel advised the court that the complainant had a mental disability and was \"unable to communicate\" within the meaning ofs. 16of theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Counsel also advised that she had earlier made out-of-court statements to a doctor and a police officer, some of which had been videotaped and all of which the Crown would apply to have admitted without calling the complainant. The Crown called Dr. Francis Gillespie as its first witness on thevoir dire.",

The complainant was not his patient and he had never before \"had any form of conversation with her\". He interviewed her on one occasion a few days before trial \"to assess her ability to give evidence in court\". He concluded that she was \"incoherent\" about the matters in issue: Did you attempt to question [the complainant] at all about the matter before the Court? Yes I did. I asked her did a man take you from the hospital and do something to you and her response to that was totally incoherent. 37Dr. John Morley, a general practitioner who had known the complainant for about six years, had direct care of her at the Waterford Hospital for about one year prior to these events, and indirect supervision of her medical care for three or four years before that, had a different view. I think at that time she would have been - I don't know how to put this - as well able to give a version of events as she would have been at any other time. What about at this time, on today's date, would she be able to give an account of what has happened last July? Possibly, but given her verbal limitations, it could be quite difficult to understand her, but I believe that she would be able to give some account, some account of what happened to her. 38Dr. Wanda Parsons, the family physician who had examined the complainant after the alleged assault testified: Were her statements coherent? Yes. 39None of the doctors suggested that the complainant would suffer trauma or other adverse effects from appearing in court. 40Subsequently, the police officers were called in thevoir direto give evidence of the complainant's out-of-court statements. 41The trial judge did not consider it necessary to have the complainant called. He preferred the opinion of Dr. Gillespie and admitted the out-of-court statements. The respondent was convicted of kidnapping, acquitted of sexual assault, but convicted of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to three years and nine months (after taking into account nine months of pre-trial custody).",

    "text": "[25]Doherty J.A., inR. v. Simpson(1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 (Ont. C.A.),at pp. 502-3, makes the point compellingly: a reasonable suspicion standard is necessary where there is the fundamental need to balance society's interest in the detection and punishment of crime with its interest in maintaining individual freedoms. A careful balancing of interests is as relevant in entrapment as it is in warrantless searches and detention. In each case, the reasonable suspicion standard is uniquely \"designed to avoid indiscriminate and discriminatory\" police conduct . This is particularly critical in cases of entrapment, since entrapment is a \"breeding ground for racial profiling\" (D. Tanovich, \"Rethinking theBona Fidesof Entrapment\" (2011), 43U.B.C.L. Rev.417, at p. 432), and has \"a disproportionate impact on poor and racialized communities\" (pp. 417‐18). Courts must be able to assess the extent to which the police, in seeking to form reasonable suspicion over a person or a place, rely upon overtly discriminatory or stereotypical thinking, or upon \"intuition\" or \"hunches\" that easily disguise unconscious racism and stereotyping (T. Quigley, Annotation toR. v. Sterling(2004), 23 C.R. (6th) 54, at p. 55;R. v. Faqi, 2010 ABPC 157, 491 A.R. 194,at para. 14; Tanovich, at pp. 437-38;MacKenzie,at paras. 64-65). [26]Requiring reasonable suspicion before tempting individuals into committing crimes also reflects Canadian law's cautious approach to the expansion of police powers. As a significant instance of that approach, our law does not consider whether the targeted accused was predisposed to commit the crime (Mack, at pp. 924 and 951-56). Allowing objectively improper police conduct to be justified by reference to the predisposition of the accused would \"permit unequal treatment\" (Mack, at p. 955), and risks imprisoning people even when their fundamental rights and procedural guarantees have been disregarded. There is a \"fundamental inequality inherent in an approach that measures the permissibility of entrapment by reference to the predisposition of the accused\" (Mack,at p. 955). [27]People are not protected against random virtue testing if we assume that entrapment occurs only when virtuous people would be tempted to commit crimes. The opportunity-based branch of theMacktest therefore establishes that police cannot subjectanyoneto random virtue testing — virtuous or non-virtuous, predisposed or non-predisposed — without reasonable suspicion. Many commentators support the test established inMackfor this very reason — that is, because its objective threshold protectseveryonefrom random testing (Ashworth, at p. 305; D. Ormerod and A.

Bronitt, \"The Law in Undercover Policing: A Comparative Study of Entrapment and Covert Interviewing in Australia, Canada and Europe\" (2004), 33Comm. World Rev.35, at p. 78; Roach, at p. 1462; D. Stuart,Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise(7th ed. 2014), at p. 653). [28]Providing individuals the opportunity to commit offences without the foundation of a reasonable suspicion also unacceptably increases the likelihood that people will commit crimes when they otherwise would not have. The risk is at its highest when the person given the opportunity is comparatively vulnerable or otherwise marginalized. Random virtue testing therefore violates the principle that it is wrong for the police to manufacture crime because it \"prey[s] on the weakness of human nature\" to entice individuals into offending . Marginalized people, with the limited resources they possess, will rarely, if ever, be able to meet the high burden of proving bad faith. There will rarely be evidence of intentional racial profiling or targeting of the vulnerable. Conversely, the test inMack— grounded in reasonable suspicion — is attainable for everyone, designed as it is to accommodate the \"qualities of humanness which all of us share\" (Mack, at p. 940). It seeks to protect the justice system and preserve the rule of law by ensuring thatallindividuals, predisposed or not, are protected from improper police conduct (Mack, at p. 961). [29]A standard of \"bad faith\" police conduct in this branch of the entrapment doctrine is no substitute for the objective standard of reasonable suspicion, which is reviewable by an independent assessor. A test of \"bad faith\" cedes primacy to the police's own assertions. Reasonable suspicion insists on an objective assessment of the information the police actually had. Reasonable suspicion thus shifts the protection of the public against unreasonable intrusions from the shadows of police discretion to the light of curial scrutiny. As described in the context of warrantless arrests by the Supreme Court of the United States inBeck v. State of Ohio, 85 S.Ct. 223 (1964), at p. 229: We may assume that the officers acted in good faith in arresting the petitioner.",

But \"good faith on the part of the arresting officers is not enough\". If subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be \"secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\" only in the discretion of the police. [Citation omitted.] [30]Further, and unlike reasonable suspicion, a standard of bad faith fails to give meaningful guidance to police officers called upon to determine whether they can offer an opportunity to commit a crime. Reasonable suspicion is anex antestandard that has stood the test of time, is \"readily applicable in practice\", and is familiar and \"meaningful to the police and trial judges\" (Kang‐Brown, at para. 164, per Deschamps J., dissenting but not on this point). It fosters in police officers a sense of the importance of obtaining objective evidence of criminal activitybeforeoffering an opportunity to commit a crime, and of being alive to indicators that suggest that their intuitions or hunches may be wrong (Chehil, at paras. 33-34). And it compels police to disclose objective evidence that is amenable to exacting review, precluding them from relying on peremptory assertions of suspicion. [31]Any lower bar — and certainly any bar that would allow the police to respond to bare tips by immediately offering an opportunity to commit a crime — would effectively be no bar at all. [32]That this is so is made plain by asking the following question: if a name and number were sufficient to allow police to intrude on protected interests, whatlesscouldpossiblybe required? The police needat leasta number to make the phone call. Such a low bar would do nothing to protect people from random virtue testing: being called by police and invited to commit an offence based on malice, rumour or gossip. The reasonably informed observer would be dismayed to learn that police are permitted to act on this information in this way simply by virtue of having received it.",

We see no basis — in this Court's jurisprudence or elsewhere — for abandoning the reasonable suspicion standard and granting police unrestricted licence to offer people the opportunity to commit crimes, free from independent and meaningful judicial oversight. IV.Issues [33]Several issues arise when entrapment is examined in the dial‐a‐dope context: A.Can a phone number — a virtual place — qualify as a location for the purposes of entrapment? B.What circumstances can give rise to reasonable suspicion in the dial‐a‐dope context? C.How should courts review the conversation between police and the accused in deciding whether reasonable suspicion has been established and when the opportunity to offend was offered? D.What constitutes provision of an opportunity to traffic in drugs during a phone call? The answers to these questions must be determined in light of the purposes of the doctrine of entrapment. V.Analysis A.Can a Phone Number Qualify as a \"Place\" Over Which Police May Form Reasonable Suspicion? [34]These appeals require us to consider how the reasonable suspicion standard applies when police are investigating a phone number, or another virtual means of communication between people, like a message board on a website. The parties agree that a phone number can qualify as a \"place\" for the purposes of the entrapment doctrine. The intervener the Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society disagrees, submitting that there is an enhanced privacy interest in virtual places as compared to physical places. Alternatively, it says a multi-factored analysis should inform the consideration of whether a place has been adequately defined.",

    "text": "Alternatively, it says a multi-factored analysis should inform the consideration of whether a place has been adequately defined. The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association adds that it is concerned that places, both physical and virtual, may be defined too broadly to allow the entrapment doctrine to be sufficiently protective. [35]The difficulty, of course, is that technology aids in the commission of crime. And in order to investigate and detect those crimes, police must also make use of technology. Further, while some virtual spaces may be too broad to support a sufficiently particularized reasonable suspicion, that concern does not arise where the space is a single phone number. As we will explain, reasonable suspicion can attach to a phone number, because it is precisely and narrowly defined. [36]Of course, a phone number is not the same thing as a public physical location. A phone is a means of private communication between persons, and calling a number, or exchanging text messages, is an inherently private activity (unlike conversing on a busy downtown Vancouver street, as inBarnes, where we might expect chance encounters with the state). A phone number provides access to an intensely private virtual space. We cultivate personal, work and family relationships through our phones; they are a portal of immediate access reserved for the select few closest to us. We carefully guard access to that space by choosing to whom we disclose our phone number and with whom we converse. Similarly, this Court has held that a person reasonably expects privacy in most digital communications, precisely because conversations over text message, social media messaging, or email, are not analogous to a \"public post\" . Virtual spaces raise unique concerns for the intrusion of the state into individuals' private lives, because of the breadth of some virtual places (for example, social media websites), the ease of remote access to a potentially large number of targets that technology provides law enforcement, and the increasing prominence of technology as a means by which individuals conduct their personal lives. [37]It follows that state surveillance over virtual spaces is of an entirely different qualitative order than surveillance over a public space. Technology and remote communication significantly increase the number of people to whom police investigators can provide opportunities, thereby heightening the risk that innocent people will be targeted.",

Online anonymity allows police to increasingly fabricate identities and \"pose\" as others to a degree that would not be possible in a public space like the Granville Mall. And they can do so anytime and anywhere, since cell phones are a 24/7 gateway into a person's private life. Individuals must be able to enjoy that privacy free from state intrusion, subject only to the police meeting an objective and reviewable standard allowing them to intrude (seeBarnes, at p. 481, perMcLachlin J., dissenting but not on this point). [38]Section 8 jurisprudence recognizes that at the \"heart of liberty in a modern state\" is the need to \"set a premium\" on the ability of its citizens to carve out spaces in their lives, sanctuaries where they may interact freely, unhindered by the possibility of encounters with the state . In the words of McLachlin C.J. (writing extra-judicially), \"The right 'to be let alone' and to define a protected sphere of individual autonomy within which neither one's neighbours nor the state can intrude without permission, is an important aspect of fundamental human dignity\" (Hon. McLachlin, \"Courts, Transparency and Public Confidence — To the Better Administration of Justice\" (2003), 8Deakin L. Rev.1, at p. 3, citing S. Warren and L. Brandeis, \"The Right to Privacy\" (1890), 4Harv.L. Rev.193, at p. 195). The human condition flourishes as the fear of state intrusion fades. [39]Relatedly, the entrapment doctrine ensures Canadians can \"go about their daily lives without courting the risk that they will be subjected to the clandestine investigatory techniques of agents of the state\" (Barnes, at p. 480, perMcLachlin J., dissenting). It is therefore important to carefully delineate and tightly circumscribe virtual locations in which police can provide the opportunity to commit a crime. As Lamer C.J. noted inBarnes, at pp. 462‐63, a reasonable suspicion can attach to a place only if it is defined with sufficient precision and \"in many cases, the size of the area itself may indicate that the investigation is notbona fide.\" Given that such an inquiry hinges on the presence of reasonable suspicion, the location must be \"sufficiently particularized\" (Chehil,at para. 30; see also S.

[40]The Crown stresses that we now find ourselves in a virtual age; while drugs used to be bought and sold in specific locations, they are now delivered into the hands of the buyer in a transaction that involves modern technology. We accept that communicating in a virtual space adds \"a layer of unpredictability\" . But it is this very unpredictability that necessitates applying the doctrine of entrapment in a way that ensures the freedoms protected in a physical space are also protected in our virtual communications. Drug dealing over the phone may well be difficult to detect, but individuals also have considerable privacy interests in their phones that must be protected from arbitrary state intrusion. The risks posed to individual interests, although different, are not ameliorated where police investigate virtual communications as opposed to a physical space. We say, to properly protect these interests, police must have reasonable suspicion over an individual or a well-defined virtual space, like a phone number, before providing an opportunity to commit a crime. [41]We emphasize that the virtual space in question must be defined with sufficient precision in order to ground reasonable suspicion. Reviewing courts must scrutinize the evidence that prompted the inquiry to ensure the police have narrowed their scope so that the purview of their inquiry is no broader than the evidence allows. To ensure that random virtue testing is avoided, factors such as (but not limited to) the following may be helpful: the seriousness of the crime in question; the time of day and the number of activities and persons who might be affected; whether racial profiling, stereotyping or reliance on vulnerabilities played a part in the selection of the location; the level of privacy expected in the area or space; the importance of the virtual space to freedom of expression; and the availability of other, less intrusive investigative techniques. [42]As previously explained, an individual phone number is sufficiently precise and narrow to qualify as a place for the purposes of the first branch of the entrapment doctrine.",

    "text": "We agree with Himel J.: \". . . phones are increasingly personal\" and, in most cases, there will be \"little real difference between information that the police obtain about the phone line and information that they obtain about the person who answers it\" (C.A. reasons, at para. 109). Typically, and as Himel J. noted, it will be a distinction without a difference, since reasonable suspicion over one grounds reasonable suspicion over the other. We therefore ought not to force categorical distinctions based upon the form such information takes — that is, information about people and information about their location (or phone numbers). Ultimately, it isa personbefore the court as an accused. And the question will always be the same: are there objective factors supporting a reasonable suspicion of drug trafficking by the individual answering the cell phone when police provide the opportunity to commit such a crime? Those factors may relate in part to reasonable suspicion of the individual, or of the phone number itself, or to both. [43]Finally, we note that lower courts have already found that police can conductbona fideinquiries into virtual spaces other than phone numbers. We repeat, however, that the serious risk of random virtue testing in such inquiries requires that the virtual space be defined narrowly and with precision (Barnes,at p. 463). In our view, entire websites or social media platforms will rarely, if ever, be sufficiently particularized to support reasonable suspicion. To permit police to target wide virtual spaces is inconsistent withMackand its threshold of reasonable suspicion, and disregards that legitimate communities exist as much online as they do in the physical world. B.How Does Reasonable Suspicion Apply to Dial‐a‐Dope Investigations? [44]As we have explained, reasonable suspicion plays a central role in the first branch of the entrapment doctrine. Police may provide an opportunity to commit a crime only upon forming reasonable suspicion. But what does reasonable suspicion mean? The appellants say it is an objective and rigorous standard that cannot be grounded in a bald tip. The Crown, however, describes a lower standard, capable of being satisfied by a single tip about a responsive target who appears to understand slang particular to the drug subculture. [45]Reasonable suspicion is, by definition, anobjectivestandard that protects individuals' interests and preserves the rule of law by ensuring courts can meaningfully review police conduct.",

    "text": "For this reason, it is fundamental to restraining the power of police to provide opportunities to commit crimes. That said, reasonable suspicion is not \"unduly onerous\" (Mack, at p. 958). As a lower standard than reasonable grounds, it allows police additional flexibility in enforcing the law and preventing crime. In the entrapment doctrine, reasonable suspicion emerges from the first branch's concern with police behaviour that falls short of actually inducing an offence, yet nonetheless constitutes police involvement in the commission of a crime. [46]While the reasonable suspicion standard requires only the possibility,rather than probability, of criminal activity (Chehil, at para. 27), it must also be remembered that it provides police officers with justification to engage in otherwise impermissible, intrusive conduct such as searches and detentions. It is therefore subject to \"rigorous\", \"independent\" and \"exacting\" judicial scrutiny (Chehil, at paras. 3 and 26). The suspicion must be focused, precise, reasonable, and based in \"objective facts that stand up to independent scrutiny\" (MacKenzie, at para. 74). InSimpson, at pp. 500-503, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, drawing from U.S. jurisprudence, this Court's application of reasonable suspicion inMack, and the articulable cause doctrine inR. v. Wilson,[1990] 1 S.C.R. 1291, summarized reasonable suspicion as requiring a \"constellation of objectively discernible facts\" giving the officer \"reasonable cause to suspect\" that a certain kind of crime was being committed by a particular person or in a particular place. This definition continues to be applied by this Court .Ultimately, the evidence said to satisfy reasonable suspicion must be carefully examined. [47]Although innocent explanations and exculpatory information remain relevant to an assessment of reasonable suspicion, the police are not required to undertake further investigation to rule out those explanations (Chehil, at paras. 33-34). Nevertheless, the facts must indicate the possibility ofcriminalbehaviour: characteristics that apply broadly to innocent people are not markers of criminal activity (Chehil, at para. 35). Mere hunches and intuition will not suffice (Barnes, at p. 460). However, an officer's training or experience can make otherwise equivocal information probative of the presence of criminal activity (Chehil, at para. 47). [48]Reasonable suspicion is alsoindividualized, in the sense that it picks an individual target — whether a person, an intersection or a phone number — out of a group of persons or places.",

    "text": "As noted above, the criminal law's objections to \"generalized suspicion\" hinge on its embrace of \"such a number of presumably innocent persons as to approach a subjectively administered, random basis\" (Chehil, at para. 30, quotingUnited States v. Gooding, 695 F.2d 78 (1982), at p. 83). When an objectively grounded suspicion instead attaches to a \"sufficiently particularized constellation of factors\" (Chehil, at para. 30), like those relating to an individual phone number, the objection falls away. In other words, the ill sought to be remedied by individualization is police intruding on the protected interests of all persons in broadly or poorly defined locations, especially on the basis of generalized evidence (Kang‐Brown, at para. 73, per Binnie J.). This is a complete answer to our colleague's concern about dissonance between the entrapment framework set out inMackandBarnesand the reasonable suspicion standard required byChehil. [49]The target to which reasonable suspicion must attach varies with the context. It must be borne in mind that in cases such asChehilandKang-Brown, this Court was concerned with ensuring that reasonable suspicion for a sniffer-dog searchof an individualis sufficiently targeted. In that particular context — the physical search of a personby a police dog — reasonable suspicion cannot attach to a location, but only to a specific person or, at most, to a number of closely linked people (Kang‐Brown,at para. 73). Indeed, the reasonable suspicion standard was selected inMackbecause, as later emphasized inChehil, while it is a uniform \"common standard that arises in a number of contexts\", it can be adapted to suit a variety of circumstances(Chehil, at para. 21). [50]Each of these appeals originated with a single tip of unknown reliability. Although a sole tip devoid of predictive information cannot meet the reasonable suspicion standard, such a tip can be sufficiently corroborated such that the standard is met (seeFlorida v. L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000), at pp. 270-71). Such corroboration must suggest that the \"tip [is] reliable in its assertion of illegality, [and] not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person\" (p. 272). [51]Police practiceitselfshows that, whether the police are investigating an individual or a phone number, various steps can be taken upon receiving a tip associating a phone number with dial-a-dope activitybeforeacting on it by calling the number.",

    "text": "Police may wait to see if more tips are received about the same person or phone number. Police may cross-reference the person's name or phone number to find other connections between it and criminal activity. Police may also consider any details contained in the tip or, if known, the reliability of the informant. For example, does the source have a criminal record? How long have the police used the source? Has the source provided credible tips in the past? Is there a possible motivation for giving a false tip (as inR. v. Olazo, 2012 BCCA 59, 287 C.C.C. (3d) 379, at para. 7, where the informant gave the tip to avoid a traffic ticket)? Is the source's information first-hand? (SeeR. v. Lal(1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 413 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 11 and 27;R. v. Townsend, [1997] O.J. No. 6516 (QL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 5;R. v. Williams, 2010 ONSC 1698 (Williams(2010)), at para. 12 (CanLII);R. v. Sawh, 2016 ONSC 2776, at para. 8 (CanLII)). As inMack,whether a tip can generate reasonable suspicion will also be connected to the currency of the information (p. 958). [52]In short, there are various ways in which the police may seek to establish reasonable suspicion before the call is made (see, e.g.,R. v. Pucci, 2018 ABCA 149, 359 C.C.C. (3d) 343, at para. 11;R. v. Clarke, 2018 ONCJ 263, at paras. 40 and 56-57 (CanLII)). In British Columbia, police officers are required to record on a \"Swansheet\" the steps they took to establish reasonable suspicion before making the call — which belies any suggestion thatMackis impractical to apply in a digital age, or that reasonable suspicion in the virtual world should represent a lower threshold than in the physical world (R. v. Li, 2019 BCCA 344, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 363, at paras. 3-4; B. MacFarlane, R. Frater and C. Michaelson,Drug Offences in Canada(4th ed. (loose-leaf)), vol. 2, at pp. 26-4 to 26-7). This practice was adopted after the Court of Appeal for British Columbia criticized the police for making hundreds of random phone calls on the basis of bare, uncorroborated tips inSwan, at para. 43. [53]Of course, it is for the police to determine how to proceed with their investigations. But to be clear, reasonable suspicion cannot be grounded on a bald tip alone (S.C.J.), at para. 25;Clarke, at para. 44).",

    "text": "But to be clear, reasonable suspicion cannot be grounded on a bald tip alone (S.C.J.), at para. 25;Clarke, at para. 44). As this Court held inR. v.Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, when the police use a tip from a confidential or anonymous source to justify an intrusion on someone's liberty, courts must scrutinize the tip.[1]It should be examined to see whether its detail is compelling, the informant is credible, and its information is corroborated in any way (Debot, at p. 1168). [54]Although it would be prudent for police officers to investigate the reliability of the tip before placing the call where they are able to do so, it is also possible for the police to form reasonable suspicion in the course of a conversation with the target, but prior to presenting the opportunity to commit a crime (see, e.g.,Townsend, at para. 50). While this is a necessary part of the \"leeway\"Mackrequires (at p. 978), police must be aware that in placing the call without reasonable suspicion, they are walking on thin ice, having already intruded upon the private life of their interlocutor. [55]That said, the target's responsiveness to details in the tip, along with other factors, may tend to confirm the tip's reliability. For example, the target's use of or response to language particular to the drug subculture properly forms part of the constellation of factors supporting reasonable suspicion (seeOlazo, at para. 26). Even so, the understanding of \"coded\" drug language by a target is not, on its own, necessarily a reliable ground for reasonable suspicion. Some phrases admit of innocent interpretation. And some people — especially vulnerable people — are simply familiar with the coded language of drug trafficking, a point made convincingly by Pringle J., writing inClarke:",

When heroin was discovered on her, she was charged with three offences, two of which proceeded to trial: possession and use of a false passport contrary tos. 368of theCriminal Code, and unlawful importation of a narcotic contrary to s. 5(1) of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-1. 3Ms. Ruzic admitted having committed both offences but claimed that she was then acting under duress and should thus be relieved from any criminal liability. She testified that, two months before her arrival in Canada, a man named Mirko Mirkovic approached her while she was walking her dog in the streets of Belgrade, where she lived in an apartment with her mother. She described him as a \"warrior\" and believed he was paid to kill people in the war. An expert witness testified at trial that, in 1994, large paramilitary groups roamed Belgrade and engaged in criminal and mafia-like activities. The same expert maintained that people living in Belgrade during that period did not feel safe. They believed the police could not be trusted. There was a real sense that the rule of law had broken down. 4From there began a series of encounters between Mirkovic and the respondent while she was walking her dog. Each time he approached her, he knew more about her, although she had shared no details of her life with him. He phoned her at home. He told her he knew her every move. Ms. Ruzic alleged that his behaviour became more and more intimidating, escalating to threats and acts of physical violence. On one occasion, he burned her arm with a lighter. On another, he stuck a syringe into her arm and injected her with a substance that smelled like heroin and made her nauseous. She indicated that these physical assaults were coupled with sexual harassment and finally threats against her mother. 5On April 25, 1994, Mirkovic phoned the respondent and instructed her to pack a bag and meet him at a hotel in central Belgrade. Once there, he allegedly strapped three packages of heroin to her body and indicated that she was to take them to a restaurant in Toronto.",

He lived close to the faculty in his sister Colette's apartment on Queen Mary Road. Neither the brother nor the sister was at that time formally a member of the Front de libération du Québec (\"F.L.Q.\"), an association declared to be unlawful by s. 3 of thePublic Order Regulations, 1970, SOR/70-444, enacted under theWar Measures Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 288. Richard Therrien's sister was, however, a friend of Jacques Rose. From October 17 to November 6, 1970, Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, Francis Simard and Bernard Lortie, the four F.L.Q. members associated with the kidnapping of the minister Pierre Laporte, hid in that apartment. Richard Therrien's involvement in these events was quite minor: he stayed in the apartment with them for only a few nights, preferring to keep his distance. At one point, he went to get materials so that they could build a hideout, and at another time he mailed three letters at the request of one of these persons. 3On November 26, 1970, Richard Therrien was charged with illegally and unlawfully giving assistance to these four individuals with intent thereby to prevent, hinder and interfere with their apprehension, trial or punishment, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that they were members of the unlawful association, contrary to s. 5 of thePublic Order Regulations, 1970. He was also charged with communicating statements on behalf of the said association, contrary to s. 4(c) of the Regulations. On April 14, 1971, he pleaded guilty and on the following day Judge Antonio Lamer, then of the Superior Court (Criminal Division), sentenced him to imprisonment for one year. 4After serving his sentence, Richard Therrien continued his legal studies and received his licence. In the spring of 1974, the examining committee of the Barreau du Québec, which was established to consider the appellant's candidacy in view of the fact that he had a criminal record, recommended that he be admitted to the professional school of the Barreau. His name was first entered on the Roll of the order on January 26, 1976.",

It also stated that the pardon granted vacates the conviction and removes any disqualification to which the person so convicted is subject by virtue of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or a regulation made thereunder. 6Between 1989 and 1996, Mr. Therrien submitted his candidacy in five selection procedures for judicial appointments. He was interviewed on four occasions by the committee for the selection of persons qualified for appointment as judges, and on each occasion committee members raised the issue of trouble with the law. In 1991 and 1993, he revealed his previous conviction and stated that he had been pardoned. His candidacy for the first two appointments was unsuccessful, and it appears clearly from the evidence of persons who were selection committee members at that time that his criminal record was a determining factor in the decision to reject his candidacy. It is not clear whether the issue was directly addressed at the third interview, but there is no doubt that during the last selection process he did not disclose his criminal record or the fact that he had been pardoned, when he was asked the following series of questions: [translation] \"Have you ever been in trouble with the law or with the Barreau? Has any disciplinary action ever been taken against you? Are there any outstanding complaints against you?\" Judge Therrien testified to the committee of inquiry of the Conseil de la magistrature that he felt he was justified in answering \"no\" to these questions for two reasons.

Seccombe met the appellant in 1992, while he was serving a jail term, and began a romantic relationship with him that continued after his release from jail in March of 1997. When Seccombe first met the appellant, Whittaker had been a tenant in her home for approximately 18 years and was\"like a brother\"to her. Whittaker and the appellant did not get along and were openly hostile toward one another. Whenever the appellant visited Seccombe, Whittaker avoided him by going downstairs to the basement to work on his computer. Whittaker indicated to Seccombe that he would move out if the appellant moved in. Accordingly, the appellant did not move in with Seccombe after his release from jail. Seccombe attributed the hostility between the appellant and Whittaker to the fact that the appellant is black and Whittaker was racist. 4The relationship between Seccombe and the appellant deteriorated, apparently because the appellant refused to make payments on a car that Seccombe had purchased on his behalf. They had a disagreement on December 24, 1997. On December 28, the appellant called Seccombe and she agreed to go to dinner and exchange Christmas gifts. 5The appellant arrived at Seccombe's home at around 4:30 p.m. on December 28. Whittaker was at home and in the basement. There is no evidence that the appellant knew Whittaker was in the house. After sharing a bottle of beer with Seccombe, drinking a shot of rum, and giving Seccombe two Christmas gifts, the appellant told Seccombe that he had also purchased a dress for her. He asked her to go upstairs and put it on to wear to dinner. Seccombe went upstairs, sat on her bed and started to undress. 6The appellant followed her into the bedroom, put his arm around her neck, and threatened her with a knife.",

The appellant told her that he was in an\"awful lot of trouble\"and needed her car keys, credit card, and personal identification number (PIN). The appellant tied her up on the bed with an extension cord and shoelaces and gagged her. He then went downstairs, returned with a bottle of rum, undressed, untied Seccombe's feet, and allegedly sexually assaulted her. Afterward, he released Seccombe so that she could go to the bathroom. The appellant then tied her up again, this time using a telephone cord. He drank more rum, brought her a beer (removing the gag but threatening Seccombe with the knife), inserted a pornographic movie into the VCR, masturbated, and then again asked for Seccombe's PIN and her daily withdrawal limit. After Seccombe gave him the information, the appellant left the room. 7For five to ten minutes the house seemed \"really quiet\" before Seccombe suddenly heard Whittaker screaming \"Oh, my God, oh, no, oh no\". After ten to fifteen minutes, the appellant returned to the bedroom, out of breath, with water or sweat pouring down his face. He wiped his knife on Seccombe's night dress, which was on the bed. The doorbell then began to ring continuously. The appellant asked Seccombe if the neighbours were home; she indicated that she did not know. The appellant left the bedroom. Three to four minutes later, a female police officer entered Seccombe's room and untied her. 8Seccombe's neighbours testified that they heard a violent struggle taking place in the basement of Seccombe's home. After hearing Whittaker saying, \"Stop, you're going to kill me\" or \"You're going to kill me\", they called the police, and an officer was dispatched at 7:14 p.m. Officers arrived at 7:18 p.m. 9The appellant met police at the door with a large bump on his forehead. Police found Whittaker in the basement beaten and stabbed to death. He had approximately forty stab wounds from the chest upward on the front and back and had been beaten with a blunt instrument. A wooden mallet was found on the floor near Whittaker's body. The knife was found upstairs in the hall. Seccombe was found tied to the bed.",

    "text": "2The accused was charged with the first degree murder of Enio Mora, who was to all appearances his close friend. At the preliminary hearing, the Crown's case against the accused was entirely circumstantial. The accused called two witnesses whose testimony was arguably exculpatory. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant committing the accused to trial. 3The Crown's evidence was to the following effect. Mora was found dead in the trunk of his Cadillac at about 4:00 p.m. on September 11th, 1996. The Cadillac was parked on the north side of Teston Road, between Pine Valley Drive and Weston Road in the City of Vaughan, which is located north of Toronto. Mora had been shot four times in the left temple at close range. 4The Crown presented no evidence purporting to establish when Mora's Cadillac was first parked at the place it was discovered. However, one witness testified that the car was not parked there when he passed the area at 10:45 a.m. Several witnesses testified that they saw the car at around 2:00 p.m., or soon after. 5The principal evidence linking the accused to the crime consisted of a bundle of clothes discovered by the side of Pine Valley Drive by Onido Salerno, a local farmer. On September 11th, Salerno was working outside on his farm, which is on Pine Valley Drive just south of Teston Road. At about 2:00 p.m., Salerno saw a black or blue car, a Buick or Oldmobile with a chrome stripe along the side, stop on the road in front of him. The driver and a passenger got out and left something in the ditch by the side of the road. The two then got back in the car and drove off. After the car had driven off, Salerno went to see what the men had left in the ditch. He found a pair of beige pants, a shirt spotted with blood, a pair of shoes, and a full package of Freedent gum. Salerno later viewed photographs at the police station and identified the driver of the car he had seen to be someone other than the accused. The Crown maintained that the man Salerno had seen was the accused. 6The Crown presented evidence as to the whereabouts of the deceased and the accused on the morning of September 11th.",

Nick Nesci, a real estate broker and long-time acquaintance of the accused, stated that the accused had arrived at his office some time soon after 10:00 a.m. One of Nesci's clients, Nicola Galiffe, had a 10:00 a.m. appointment with Nesci and was already in the office. Mora arrived at about 10:20 or 10:30 a.m, to follow up on an offer Nesci had made to get him a good price on an exercise treadmill. Nesci left his office at about 11:00 a.m. for an appointment. He left Galiffe, Mora, and the accused standing outside his office, \"talking like old friends\". That was the last he saw of them that day, and the last he saw of Mora. 7Galiffe was not called as a witness but he submitted a signed statement to the police stating that he, Mora, and the accused went for coffee after leaving Nesci's office. 8Some time on the morning of September 11th, Mora paged Giancarlo Serpe, an acquaintance, to ask him to meet for coffee at 11:30 a.m. The two apparently met for coffee on a daily basis. They met for about 20 minutes or half an hour. In examination-in-chief, Serpe stated that Mora left the donut shop at about 11:30. On cross-examination, he stated that it was about 12:00 noon. In any event it seems he is the last witness to have seen Mora alive. 9The accused cooperated with the police investigation. In the course of one interview, he stated that he had been in Mora's car on September 10th. The police therefore asked him to provide \"elimination prints\"; he agreed. He also agreed to provide a buccal swab for D.N.A. testing. 10Forensic tests revealed that the D.N.A. profile taken from the collar of the shirt found by Onido Salerno matched that of the accused and that the blood on the shirt was Mora's. The accused was arrested on December 3rd and charged with first degree murder. A packet of Freedent gum was found on his person. The shirt the accused was wearing at the time of his arrest was about the same size as the shirt that Onido Salerno had found.",

From the accused's residence, the police seized, among other things, several packages of Freedent gum, many pairs of shoes, many pairs of pants, several rounds of .22 calibre bullets, a .22 calibre rifle, and a double-barreled shotgun. Many of the shoes and most of the pants were the same size as those that Onido Salerno had found on Pine Valley Drive. The laces on some pairs of shoes were tied in double knots, as had been the laces on the pair of shoes that Onido Salerno had found. According to an R.C.M.P. expert who examined several of the shoes, it was \"highly probable\" that the person who had worn the shoes that Onido Salerno had found was the same person who had worn the shoes found in the accused's residence. The accused's car was seized on December 4th. It was a blue, 1989, 4-door Buick Park Avenue, with a wide chrome strip along the bottom of the fenders and doors. Inside the car, the police found, among other things, Freedent gum and a pair of boots. 11The police theorized that Mora had been murdered at a farm located at 10367 Weston Road. The distance between the farm and the place Mora's car was found could be traveled in slightly over a minute, driving at 65 kilometres per hour. The farm is owned by Nicola DiLorenzo, for whom the accused had worked \"a long time ago\". DiLorenzo stated that he had never seen the accused at the farm. However, the accused's son has done work for DiLorenzo. Soil samples taken from one of the barns matched soil found on Mora's clothing and shoes as well as on the shoes found by Onido Salerno on Pine Valley Drive. The police also found feathers and feather fragments similar to those found with Mora's body, on the boots found in the accused's car, and on the shirt and pants found by Salerno.",

Galiffe was getting into his own car.

    "text": "5The respondent, 671122 Ontario Limited, formerly Design Dynamics Limited (\"Design\"), was Canadian Tire Corporation's principal supplier of synthetic sheepskin car seat covers for 30 years. Canadian Tire was the party in the position of strength in the relationship. This is so as it represented more than 60 percent of the Canadian seat cover market and, by 1983, was Design's largest customer accounting for over 50 percent of its sales. 6In June 1984, Design lost Canadian Tire's business. Robert Summers, the head of Canadian Tire's automotive division, advised Design that another company, the appellants Sagaz Industries Canada Inc. and Sagaz Industries Inc. (collectively \"Sagaz\"), would be replacing Design as Canadian Tire's seat cover supplier. Sagaz is a Florida corporation and the appellant, Joseph Kavana, is its president. Sagaz Industries Inc. continues to supply Canadian Tire and Sagaz Industries Canada Inc. is inactive. 7Summers terminated Canadian Tire's supply relationship with Design in favour of Sagaz because of bribery in the form of a \"kickback\" scheme. Sagaz retained American Independent Marketing Inc. (\"AIM\"), a New York corporation, to assist in marketing Sagaz's seat covers to Canadian Tire. AIM was owned and controlled by Stewart Landow. It was later determined that Summers accepted a bribe from Landow and AIM in relation to the Sagaz seat cover contract. Specifically, Summers incorporated a sham corporation, International Marketing Consultants (\"IMC\"), to receive the bribery money. Summers employed a surrogate, Anthony Brathwaite, as a token manager of IMC. Brathwaite was the puppet of Summers who received all the profits of IMC. Summers entered into an agreement with Landow whereby Landow (through AIM) would pay Summers (through IMC) two percent of all sales by Sagaz to Canadian Tire of synthetic seat covers in order to ensure the sales occurred. As a result of the bribe, Summers terminated Canadian Tire's relationship with Design. 8Summers' wrongdoing was discovered in 1985. His employment with Canadian Tire was terminated and he was eventually convicted of corruptly accepting benefits and went to prison. He later went bankrupt. Brathwaite pleaded guilty to similar charges. 9Summers was replaced by new management at Canadian Tire which re-evaluated its purchase of synthetic seat covers. Management determined that it preferred the seat cover products of Sagaz to those of Design.",

Accordingly, Canadian Tire retained its relationship with Sagaz as its supplier. 10Having lost its major customer, Design's manufacturing business went into a steep decline. It sold its assets in 1988. In 1989, Design brought an action against some 13 defendants, including Canadian Tire, Summers, Brathwaite, Landow, AIM, Sagaz and Kavana. At the trial, only AIM, Landow (who did not testify), Sagaz and Kavana remained as defendants. Canadian Tire paid Design $750,000 to settle the action against it. The action against Summers was discontinued when he went bankrupt.

    "text": "[46]In practice, the new provisions are simultaneously more generous to the accused and more restrictive: the provisions narrow the scope of self‐defence in some factual circumstances and broaden it in others (R. v. Bengy, 2015 ONCA 397, 325 C.C.C. (3d) 22, at paras. 47-48; Paciocco (2014), at p. 296). The transposition of mandatory conditions into mere factors suggests more flexibility in accessing the defence, but this added flexibility is counter-balanced by the requirement to consider certain factors — including proportionality and the availability of other means to respond to the use or threat of force — in every case in which they are relevant, regardless of the genesis of the confrontation or the features of the dispute. [47]The question also arises whether the amendments have altered the scope or nature of self-defence by shifting its moral foundation from justification to excuse. On a justificatory account of self-defence, killing in self-defence is not considered wrongful because it upholds the right to life and autonomy of the person acting. It is grounded on the necessity of self-preservation (R. v. Pilon, 2009 ONCA 248, 243 C.C.C. (3d) 109, at para. 68). In contrast, an excuse negates the blameworthiness of the accused. It mainly works by denying the voluntary character of an act that is nevertheless wrongful. A number of theorists have questioned whether self-defence is a justification, especially outside the classic case of defence against an unlawful use of force. They are divided in cases where the accused uses force against a reasonably perceived threat that does not exist in fact, against an attack that they have provoked, and when the defending act is not proportional or necessary (A. Brudner, \"Constitutionalizing self-defence\" (2011), 61U.T.L.J.867, at pp. 891-95; C. Fehr, \"Self-Defence and the Constitution\" (2017), 43Queen's L.J.85, at p. 109; K.

Roach, \"A Preliminary Assessment of the New Self‐Defence and Defence of Property Provisions\" (2012), 16Can. Rev.275, at p. 276-77). In such cases, the defending act is not considered rightful or tolerable by many authors, but guilt can be avoided when the circumstances call into question the voluntariness of the act, which brings it closer to an excuse and the law of necessity. [48]The 2013 amendments further obscure the moral foundation of self-defence. The new provisions retain the underlying principle that the accused's actions are a response to an external threat to their bodily integrity. However, unlike the old law, the self-defence provisions no longer use the language of justification. Section 34 simply states that the accused \"is not guilty of an offence\" where the requirements of the defence are met. Further, the elimination of an \"unlawfu[l] assaul[t]\" (per the previous s. 34(1)) or an \"apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm\" (per the previous s. 34(2)) as discrete triggering features arguably removes any residual boundary between the \"morally justifiable\" and \"morally excusable\" categories of the defence. Some argue that the new s. 34 may accommodate a continuum of moral conduct, including acts that are merely \"morally permissible\" where the threat and response meet a reasoned equilibrium (Fehr, at p. 102). This suggests the defence is neither purely a justification nor an excuse, instead occupying a middle ground of \"permissibility\" between rightfulness and blamelessness. As will become apparent, the line between justification and excuse has been blurred by the amendments, and this must be taken into consideration in interpreting the new provisions. Because the defence is now available in circumstances that may not fit neatly within the traditional justification-based framework, the need to consider all of the accused's conduct over the course of the incident that is relevant to the reasonableness of the act of purported self-defence takes on greater importance. [49]To summarize, while a driving purpose of the amendments was to simplify the law of self‐defence in Canada, Parliament also effected a significant shift. It is widely recognized by appellate courts across the country and academics that these amendments resulted in substantive changes to the law of self‐defence (Bengy, at paras. 45-50;R. v.",

Watt,Watt's Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions(2nd ed. 2015), at p. 1255). The words \"person's role in the incident\" in s. 34(2)(c) must be interpreted in light of the expansive and substantive changes to the law and not read simply with reference to the old provisions. [50]I will now turn to a more detailed review of the three inquiries under s. 34 before setting out how the new phrase \"person's role in the incident\" under s. 34(2)(c) should be interpreted. C.The Three Inquiries Under Section 34 [51]The three inquiries under s. 34(1), set out above, can usefully be conceptualized as (1) the catalyst; (2) the motive; and (3) the response (Technical Guide, at p. 11; C.A. reasons, at para. 42; see also S. Coughlan, \"The Rise and Fall of Duress: How Duress Changed Necessity Before Being Excluded by Self‐Defence\" (2013), 39Queen's L.J.83, at p. 116). I will now discuss each of these inquiries separately. (1)The Catalyst— Paragraph 34(1)(a): Did the Accused Believe, on Reasonable Grounds, that Force Was Being Used or Threatened Against Them or Another Person? [52]This element of self‐defence considers the accused's state of mind and the perception of events that led them to act. As stated previously, the new provisions include both defence of self and defence of another. Unless the accused subjectively believed that force or a threat thereof was being used against their person or that of another, the defence is unavailable. [53]Importantly, the accused's actual belief must be held \"on reasonable grounds\".",

[53]Importantly, the accused's actual belief must be held \"on reasonable grounds\". Good reason supports the overlay of an objective component when assessing an accused's belief under s. 34(1)(a) and in the law of self‐defence more generally. As self‐defence operates to shield otherwise criminal acts from punitive consequence, the defence cannot depend exclusively on an individual accused's perception of the need to act. The reference to reasonableness incorporates community norms and values in weighing the moral blameworthiness of the accused's actions (Cinous, at para. 121). It \"is a quality control measure used to maintain a standard of conduct that is acceptable not to the subject, but to society at large\" (Paciocco (2014), at p. 278). [54]The test to judge the reasonableness of the accused's belief under the self-defence provisions has traditionally been understood to be a blended or modified objective standard. Reasonableness was not measured \"from the perspective of the hypothetically neutral reasonable man, divorced from the appellant's personal circumstances\" . Instead, it was contextualized to some extent: the accused's beliefs were assessed from the perspective of an ordinary person who shares the attributes, experiences and circumstances of the accused where those characteristics and experiences were relevant to the accused's belief or actions (Lavallee, at p. 883). [55]For example, an accused's prior violent encounters with the victim were taken into account to assess whether the accused believed on reasonable grounds that they faced an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm (Pétel,at p. 13-14;Lavallee, at pp. 874 and 889;Charlebois,at para. 14;R. v. Currie(2002),166 C.C.C. (3d) 190 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 43-44;R. v. Sheri(2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 155 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 77). An accused's mental disabilities were also considered in the reasonableness assessment (Nelson, at pp. 370-72;R. v. Kagan, 2004 NSCA 77, 224 N.S.R. (2d) 118, at paras. 37-45). [56]However, not all personal characteristics or experiences are relevant to the modified objective inquiry. The personal circumstances of the accused that influence their beliefs — be they noble, anti-social or criminal — should not undermine theCriminal Code's most basic purpose of promoting public order (Cinous, at para. 128, per Binnie J., concurring).",

Reasonableness is not considered through the eyes of individuals who are overly fearful, intoxicated, abnormally vigilant or members of criminal subcultures 141, at para. 98). Similarly, the ordinary person standard is \"informed by contemporary norms of behaviour, including fundamental values such as the commitment to equality provided for in theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" . Personal prejudices or irrational fears towards an ethnic group or identifiable culture could never acceptably inform an objectively reasonable perception of a threat. This limitation ensures that racist beliefs which are antithetical to equality cannot ground a belief held on reasonable grounds. Doherty J.A. succinctly illustrated this principle in his reasons in this appeal, at para. 49: For example, an accused's \"honest\" belief that all young black men are armed and dangerous could not be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of that accused's belief that the young black man he shot was armed and about to shoot him. To colour the reasonableness inquiry with racist views would undermine the very purpose of that inquiry. The justificatory rationale for the defence is inimical to a defence predicated on a belief that is inconsistent with essential community values and norms. [57]The question is not therefore what the accused thought was reasonable based on their characteristics and experiences, but rather what a reasonable person with those relevant characteristics and experiences would perceive (Pilon,at para. 74).The law also continues to accept that an honest but mistaken belief can nevertheless be reasonable and does not automatically bar a claim to self‐defence (Lavallee, at p. 874;Pétel, at p. 13;R. v. Billing, 2019 BCCA 237, 379 C.C.C. (3d) 285, at para. 9;R. v. Robinson,2019 ABQB 889, at para. 23 (CanLII);R. v. Cunha, 2016 ONCA 491, 337 C.C.C. (3d) 7, at para. 8). [58]Reasonableness is ultimately a matter of judgment and \"[t]o brand a belief as unreasonable in the context of a self‐defence claim is to declare the accused's act criminally blameworthy\" (C.A. reasons, at para. 46; see alsoCinous, at para. 210, per Arbour J. in dissent but not on this point;Pilon, at para. 75;Phillips, at para. 98; G.",

(2)The Motive— Paragraph 34(1)(b): Did the Accused Do Something for the Purpose of Defending or Protecting Themselves or Another Person from that Use or Threat of Force? [59]The second element of self‐defence considers the accused's personal purpose in committing the act that constitutes the offence. Section 34(1)(b) requires that the act be undertaken by the accused to defend or protect themselves or others from the use or threat of force. This is a subjective inquiry which goes to the root of self‐defence. If there is no defensive or protective purpose, the rationale for the defence disappears (seeBrunelle v. R., 2021 QCCA 783, at paras. 30-33;R. v. Craig, 2011 ONCA 142, 269 C.C.C. (3d) 61, at para. 35; Paciocco (2008), at p. 29). The motive provision thus ensures that the actions of the accused are not undertaken for the purpose of vigilantism, vengeance or some other personal motivation. [60]The motive provision also distinguishes self‐defence from other situations that may involve the excusable or authorized application of force by an accused, such as preventing the commission of an offence (s. 27), defence of property (s. 35) or citizen's arrest (s. 494). Clarity as to the accused's purpose is critical, as the spectrum of what qualifies as a reasonable response may be limited by the accused's purpose at any given point in time. The range of reasonable responses will be different depending on whether the accused's purpose is to defend property, effect an arrest, or defend themselves or another from the use of force. [61]An accused's purpose for acting may evolve as an incident progresses or escalates. Parliament's decision to modify the law of defence of person, defence of property and citizen's arrest under a single bill recognized this overlap, as each is \"directly relevant to the broader question of how citizens can lawfully respond when faced with urgent and unlawful threats to their property, to themselves and to others\" (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 58, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., December 1, 2011, at p. 3833 (Robert Goguen)). Initial steps taken to defend one's property may transition into a situation of self‐defence. Likewise, separate defences may rightly apply to distinct offences or phases of an incident (Cormier, at para. 67).",

Likewise, separate defences may rightly apply to distinct offences or phases of an incident (Cormier, at para. 67). At the same time, great care is needed to properly articulate the threat or use of force that existed at a particular point in time so that the assessment of the accused's action can be properly aligned to their stated purpose. Clarity of purpose is not meant to categorize the accused's conduct in discrete silos, but instead appreciate the full context of a confrontation, how it evolved and the accused's role, if any, in bringing that evolution about. As recognized by the then-Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Justice at second reading, \"all of these laws, any one of which may be pertinent to a given case, must be clear, flexible and provide the right balance between self-help and the resort to the police. That is why all these measures are joined together in Bill C-26\" (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 58, at p. 3833 (Robert Goguen)). (3)The Response— Paragraph 34(1)(c): Was the Accused's Conduct Reasonable in the Circumstances? [62]The final inquiry under s. 34(1)(c) examines the accused's response to the use or threat of force and requires that \"the act committed [be] reasonable in the circumstances\". The reasonableness inquiry under s. 34(1)(c) operates to ensure that the law of self‐defence conforms to community norms of conduct. By grounding the law of self-defence in the conduct expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances, an appropriate balance is achieved between respecting the security of the person who acts and security of the person acted upon. The law of self-defence might otherwise \"encourage hot‐headedness and unnecessary resorts to violent self‐help\" (Roach, at pp. 277‐78). That the moral character of self-defence is thus now inextricably linked to the reasonableness of the accused's act is especially important as certain conditions that were essential to self-defence under the old regime — such as the nature of the force or threat of force raising a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm — have been turned into mere factors under s. 34(2). [63]The transition to \"reasonableness\" under s. 34(1)(c) illustrates the new scheme's orientation towards broad and flexible language.",

    "text": "While later judicial interpretations of the old law treated the words \"no more force than is necessary\" as akin to \"reasonableness\" , the new provision explicitly adopts this standard and applies it in all cases. As such, the ordinary meaning of the provision is more apparent to the everyday citizen and not dependent on an appreciation of judicial interpretation or terms of art (Technical Guide, at p. 21). This reflects Parliament's intent to make the law of self-defence more comprehensible and accessible to the Canadian public (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 109, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., April 24, 2012, at pp. 7063-64 (Robert Goguen)). [64]Through s. 34(2), Parliament has also expressly structured how a decision maker ought to determine whether an act of self-defence was reasonable in the circumstances. As the language of the provision dictates, the starting point is that reasonableness will be measured according to \"the relevant circumstances of the person, the other parties and the act\". This standard both casts a wide net of inquiry covering how the act happened and what role each person played and modifies the objective standard to take into account certain characteristics of the accused — including size, age, gender, and physical capabilities (s. 34(2)(e)). Also added into the equation are certain experiences of the accused, including the relationship and history of violence between the parties (s. 34(2)(f) and (f.1)). [65]Nevertheless, the trier of fact should not be invited to simply slip into the mind of the accused. The focus must remain on what a reasonable person would have done in comparable circumstances and not what a particular accused thought at the time. For example, even if Mr. Khill's military training qualifies as a relevant personal characteristic, it does not convert the reasonableness determination into a personal standard built only for him, much less a lower standard than would otherwise be expected of a reasonable person in his shoes. The law of self-defence cannot offer different rules of engagement for what happens at the homes of those with military experience or allow \"training\" to replace discernment and judgment. Section 34(1)(c) asks whether the \"act committed is reasonable in the circumstances\". It does not ask whether Mr. Khill's military training makes his act reasonable nor whether it was reasonable for this accused to have committed the act.",

[66]As observed by Doherty J.A. at para. 58 of his reasons, the \"relevant circumstances of the accused\" in s. 34(2) can also include any mistaken beliefs reasonably held by the accused. If the court determines that the accused believed wrongly, but on reasonable grounds, that force was being used or threatened against them under s. 34(1)(a), that finding is relevant to the reasonableness inquiry under s. 34(1)(c). However, while s. 34(1)(a) and (b) address the belief and the subjective purpose of the accused, the reasonableness inquiry under s. 34(1)(c) is primarily concerned with the reasonableness of the accused'sactions, not their mental state.",

    "text": "Ruby,Sentencing(2nd ed. 1980), at pp. 423-24) [171]Unlike starting points, ranges are not presumptions. Sentencing judges do not have to begin their analysis at the range and adjust the sentence to reflect the individualized circumstances of the accused. Ranges simply demonstrate the typical breadth of sentences for an offence. In considering the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender together, they allow judges to give full effect to both of these elements. [172]I find it telling that the Court of Appeal of Alberta considered that using starting points for young offenders was inappropriate because of the significant measure of individualization in sentencing a young person (R. v. W. (C.W.)(1986), 43 Alta. L.R. (2d) 208, at pp. 212-13). This Court has now clearly stated that \"sentencing is first and foremost an individualized exercise\" for adult offenders as well (Boudreault, at para. 58). If starting points are incompatible with individualization for young offenders, they should be for adult offenders as well. (ii)Pre‐Weighing Factors by the Appellate Court [173]By \"building in\" some factors to the starting point, the appellate court effectively prescribes the weight to be given to these factors by sentencing judges, displacing the sentencing judges' discretion to determine their weight. A portion of the analysis is already conducted. Pre‐weighing factors directly encroaches on sentencing judges' discretion: \"The weighing of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of discretion is all about\" (McKnight, at para. 35, cited with approval inNasogaluak, at para. 46). Even where it is not done explicitly, as my colleagues propose (at para. 46), mitigating factors will always be implicitly \"built in\" to starting points, as the very notion of a starting point requires a baseline or archetypal offence and offender. [174]Take \"good character\", a factor built in starting points (Arcand, at para. 132;Felix(ABCA), at para. 45). Absent a finding that the offender's character was \"even better than might be supposed\", a sentencing judge may not give it different or additional weight (Arcand, at para. 135). Sentencing judges, not appellate courts, should determine what weight to give to this factor in light of the individual circumstances of the offender. Building this factor into the starting point interferes with sentencing judges' ability and duty to consider all relevant circumstances in sentencing (Stone, at para. 244).",

    "text": "Building this factor into the starting point interferes with sentencing judges' ability and duty to consider all relevant circumstances in sentencing (Stone, at para. 244). Moreover, building in \"good character\" assumes that it applies in the same way to all offenders and overlooks that good character has many degrees (Bloos and Renke, at p. 803). Such a methodology is incompatible with individualized sentencing. [175]I acknowledge that some sentencing ranges have also incorporated mitigating factors such as prior good character into the sentencing range (see, e.g.,R. v. H. (C.N.)(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 564 (C.A.), at para. 32;R. v. Voong,2015 BCCA 285, 374 B.C.A.C. 166;R. v. Cunningham(1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (Ont. CA), at p. 546). They do not represent the norm. In my view, building in such factors in ranges is also questionable having regard to individualization. But, in any case, building in factors in a range does not impede individualization in the same way as starting points. Sentencing judges retain the discretion to evaluate the weight of the good character of the accused (for example) within or even outside the range. Judges using the starting-point approach do not. (iii)Starting Points Produce an Artificial Sentencing Methodology by Overemphasizing the Judicially Created Category [176]Under the starting‐point approach, categorization is pivotal. For example, while \"not always easy to draw\" (Felix(ABCA), at para. 51), the distinction between commercial and wholesale trafficking in cocaine is the difference between a three and four and one-half‐year starting point (R. v. Rahime, 2001 ABCA 203, 95 Alta. L.R. (3d) 237, at para. 18;R. v. Ma, 2003 ABCA 220, 23 Alta. L.R. (4th) 14). If the same proportion applies to fentanyl, this elusive distinction will determine whether a six or nine‐year starting point is applicable. This improperly shifts the main focus from whether a sentence is just and appropriate for an offender to which judicially‐created category applies. In addition, the starting-point approach requires parties and judges to identify which factors can justify deviation from the starting point having regard to the factors that are already built in the hypothetical baseline offence.

    "text": "In addition, the starting-point approach requires parties and judges to identify which factors can justify deviation from the starting point having regard to the factors that are already built in the hypothetical baseline offence. Bloos and M. Plaxton say, starting points \"subject the sentencing process to an unnatural compartmentalization of factors that either over‐complicates the process, or forces the sentencing judge to give certain factors more or less weight than is appropriate\" (\"Starting-Point Sentencing and the Application ofLabergeIn Unlawful Act Manslaughter Cases\" (2003), 6C.R.(6th) 346, at p. 352). [177]Sentencing judges should not be burdened with such artificial and convoluted debates, rules and categories. They should instead consider all relevant factors in an integrated manner and compare them to comparable cases to determine the just and appropriate sentence for the offender before the court (Bloos and Plaxton, at p. 352). [178]Sentencing ranges do not raise similar concerns. Ranges for related categories typically overlap, while the jump from one starting point to the next is jagged. Ranges instruct sentencing judges to view the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender as a matter of degree, on a continuum. As a result, as the intervener the Legal Aid Society of Alberta notes, ranges \"rarely see judges bogged down in disagreements about whether an offence comes within a defined subcategory, or whether a fact aggravates or mitigates compared to some hypothetical baseline offence\" (I.F., at para. 3). It is a methodology more conducive to individualized sentencing. (iv)The \"Clustering\" Effect of Starting Points [179]Commentators have noted that the starting-point approach has the \"natural effect of bunching sentences around a median rather than spreading them across a range to suit individualized circumstances\" (Manson (1997), at p. 282). This is the \"clustering\" effect, which is \"antithetical to individualization: the more clustering we observe, the less likely it is that sentence outcomes reflect the unique nature of each case or are proportionate\" (I. Marder and J. Pina‐Sánchez, \"Nudge the judge? Theorizing the interaction between heuristics, sentencing guidelines and sentence clustering\" (2020), 20C.C.J.399, at p. 401). By contrast, sentences spread along ranges can better reflect individualized circumstances. [180]The parties contest whether \"clustering\" can be empirically established. However, I note that \"clustering\" effects in sentencing have been studied by several commentators (see, e.g., Marder and Pina‐Sánchez; M.",

L. & Criminology489, at pp. 523‐29 (finding that even advisory sentencing grids acted as a \"hulking anchor for most judges\"); D. Isaacs, \"Baseline Framing in Sentencing\" (2011), 121Yale L.J.426, at p. 426 (finding that \"sentences disproportionately cluste[r] around the typical sentence in a typical crime baseline regime\" (emphasis deleted)); C. Guthrie, J. Rachlinski and A. Wistrich, \"Inside the Judicial Mind\" (2001), 86Cornell L. Rev.777, at pp. 787‐94 (on the \"anchoring\" effect of numerical values more generally)). The anchoring effect is a well‐known cognitive bias: final judgments are disproportionately biased toward the starting point of a decision‐maker's reasoning (A. Tversky and D. Kahneman, \"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\" (1974), 185Science1124, at p. 1128). While sentencing ranges can also produce clustering effects, this tends to be in jurisdictions where ranges are established by sentencing grids (e.g., various U.S. states) or by sentencing commissions (e.g., the United Kingdom) (Marder and Pina‐Sánchez; Bennett). [181]The Crown points to sentences that deviate significantly from the starting point as evidence of the absence of clustering effect. In many of the cases it cites, however, the Court of Appeal intervened and varied restrained sentences that were crafted because of the individual circumstances of offenders and offences for not properly applying a starting point (R. v. Corbiere,2017 ABCA 164, 53 Alta. L.R. (6th) 1;R. v. Giroux,2018 ABCA 56, 68 Alta. L.R. (6th) 21;R. v. L'Hirondelle, 2018 ABCA 33;R. v. Melnyk, 2014 ABCA 344, 584 A.R. 238). Consequently, these cases do not stand for the proposition that the starting-point approach is compatible with individualized sentencing and do not refute the clustering effect. [182]In addition, \"clustering\" also follows logically. For instance, it will be more difficult to impose a 90‐day sentence for an offender convicted of trafficking in cocaine or crack cocaine with strong rehabilitative potential and significant mitigating factors if the starting point is 3 years than if there is a 6 months to 4 years range of sentence (comp.R. v.

(b)Starting Points Overemphasize Denunciation and Deterrence [184]In theory, the Court of Appeal could set starting points to account for the various principles of sentencing. But this would overlook how starting points operate in practice. Starting points are often established to emphasize deterrence and denunciation and, in turn, to ensure more retributive punishment (Manson (1997), at p. 279, citingR. v. Sprague(1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 513 (Alta. C.A.);Johnas).

The incident giving rise to those charges occurred in August of 1996, where the appellant was alleged to have attempted to strangle his wife and assault his daughter in the midst of a struggle at the wife's place of residence. 4The Crown claimed that the accused attacked his wife with the intent to strangle her using a length of rope. This attempt was thwarted when the daughter unexpectedly intervened and a loud struggle, during which the daughter was assaulted by the appellant, forced the appellant to flee the scene. The appellant claims to have been struggling with his wife in an effort to prevent her from strangling herself with a length of rope when his daughter entered the room. The daughter, under the mistaken impression he was assaulting her mother, attacked him and he attempted to subdue her. Eventually, the struggle became very loud and out of control, and the appellant fled the scene. The appellant testified as to his version of events, and the appellant's wife and daughter testified in support of the Crown's version. The Crown's case also rested on some circumstantial evidence. 5The appellant appealed his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on several grounds, including that the trial judge erred in law by misdirecting the jury on the proper definition of reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal convened a special five-judge panel, and heard the case with two others,R. v. K. (K.)(2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 35, 2000 BCCA 161, andR. v. Finley(2000), 134 B.C.A.C. 142, 2000 BCCA 160. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the basis that the errors alleged, unlike those made by the trial judge inLifchus,supra, could not have misled the jury. However, two judges dissented and found that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to give the term \"reasonable doubt\" its plain and natural meaning, and that this error was compounded by the trial judge's failure to instruct the jury that more than probable guilt was required for a conviction.

The accused testified that Corkum and his friend Stanley Gowan committed the break-in. 4Two weeks after that meeting, Corkum telephoned the accused, ostensibly to ask him to join a car race, which he agreed to do, and subsequently the accused picked Corkum and Gowan up at Corkum's house. 5After some late-night driving escapades, the accused testified that Corkum and Gowan asked to be dropped off at a friend's house. The accused agreed, and further agreed to park and wait for five minutes. 6The accused testified that he was surprised to see Corkum return to the car with a 200-pound toolbox, which Corkum put on the back seat. The toolbox was stolen from a garage attached to the house Corkum and Gowan had visited. The accused testified that he objected and prevented the pair from putting certain other objects in the trunk of the car. 7Meanwhile, the victim of the theft was awakened by a commotion in the garage from which the tools were stolen. He called the police, who arrived quickly. 8The accused saw car lights approaching his car. Thinking it was the police, the accused said he panicked. He sped away without turning on his headlights and hit a parked car. The accused was arrested and charged with breaking, entering and possession of stolen property. Of the three individuals allegedly involved in the thefts, the accused was the only person to be prosecuted. 9At his trial, the accused called Corkum, who corroborated the accused's testimony that the accused was a dupe. Corkum testified: \"I didn't let him know. I guess you could say I sort of used him to do it\". 10Crown counsel cross-examined Corkum's knowledge ofs. 13of theCharter. During the cross-examination, the following exchange that is at the nub of the present appeal took place: Q So, defence counsel told you it would be better if you didn't talk to me? A Yeah. Q And you know that you can't be prosecuted for this break and enter as a result of evidence you give in court? A I didn't know that.",

I have found no legitimate reason to reformulate theSmitherstest, rather it is my opinion that such alteration should be strenuously proscribed since it will elevate the threshold of causation. As a result, Iconsider the current language of \"a contributing cause [of death] that is not trivial or insignificant\" to be the correct formulation that trial judges should use when expressing to the jury the standard of causation for all homicide offences. 15I would dismiss the appeal.

    "text": "40On February 13, 1998, after a trial before Madam Justice Keyser and a jury, the appellant, Mohamed Ameerulla Khan, was convicted of the first degree murder of his wife, Sureta Khan. This was his third trial. Previous convictions had been set aside by the Manitoba Court of Appeal. 41The appellant claimed to have discovered his deceased wife in the bathtub of their home at 6:55 p.m. on January 4, 1994 and to have then telephoned 911. The appellant's call was transferred to a first responder who instructed him to leave his wife in the bathtub and drain the water, and that help would arrive very shortly. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful. 42The Crown asserted that the appellant had killed his wife. Its evidence was mainly circumstantial. A pathologist, Dr. John Kelly Martin MacDonald, who was recognized as an expert in forensic pathology, testified for the Crown as to the possible circumstances of the death. The Court of Appeal summarized Dr. MacDonald's evidence in the following manner ((1999), 138 Man. R. (2d) 23, at para. 9): Dr. MacDonald testified positively that the deceased did not die in the bathtub either by wet or dry drowning. In his opinion, she died from asphyxiation, but in an unknown manner. He estimated the time of death to be between two and four hours before the first responders observed her, which would fix the time of death to be between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. 43Dr. MacDonald's opinion as to the time of death was based on the extent of rigor mortis found in the deceased's body by the first responders and on her core body temperature recorded at the hospital shortly after she was transported there at approximately 8:30 p.m. 44Dr. MacDonald's opinion that the deceased did not die in the bathtub was based on the absence of \"washerwoman changes or syndrome\" on her body. \"Washerwoman syndrome\" may be described as changes in the skin condition that result from being immersed in water. According to Dr. MacDonald, if the deceased was in cool water, which would reduce the extent of washerwoman changes, he would not have expected the extent of rigor which was observed by the first responders. 45Dr. MacDonald further testified that in his opinion asphyxia or oxygen starvation was the cause of death.",

    "text": "Although the mode of asphyxiation was unclear, Dr. MacDonald was of the opinion that the death could not be classified as being of undetermined origin. Dr. MacDonald testified as follows: I think her mode of asphyxia is undetermined. If she was not discovered in the bathtub, I think the -- it may very well be an undetermined death, but given the fact that she was in the bathtub when the information that would argue that she has been dead at least a couple of hours and she does not have the washerwoman's changes, that she did not die in the bathtub, so I have great reluctance having the idea that natural deaths walk, let alone undetermined deaths walk. I do not think I could classify this or not argue with someone who wished to classify this cause of death as undetermined. 46The appellant relied on a defence of alibi. However, he did not testify during the trial. Rather, evidence as to the appellant's whereabouts on the day in question was provided by an acquaintance, Mr. Marshall Ross, and through the filing of two exhibits. Mr. Ross indicated that the appellant arrived at his home at 3:40 p.m. in order to do some work on his daughter's car. He added that, at 4:01 p.m., the deceased called to speak to the appellant. Finally, Mr. Ross stated that the appellant left his home at 5:00 p.m. His recollection of the time of departure was an estimate based on the time he sat down for dinner and the time it would have taken his wife to prepare the meal from the time the appellant left. Although Mr. Ross was a witness called by the Crown, counsel for the Crown, in his closing arguments, suggested that Mr. Ross' recollection as to the time of departure was incorrect and that, in fact, the appellant left his residence earlier. After the appellant left the Ross home, Mr. Ross heard from him a few minutes prior to 7:00 p.m., when the appellant called to tell him that his wife was lying in the bathtub and appeared not to be breathing.",

The machine was located five minutes away from the appellant's residence. Moreover, the appellant produced a receipt from a pharmacy indicating that a prescription order was received at 5:44 p.m. and paid for at 6:35 p.m. 48The evidence also established that the deceased was heavily insured and that the appellant was the beneficiary. The Crown's theory was that the appellant was the only person with access to the house, with a motive and with the opportunity to kill the deceased. The theory of the defence was that the death was unexplained, that the autopsy was inconclusive and that there was insufficient evidence of foul play. 49During the course of its deliberations, the jury requested transcripts of Dr. MacDonald's testimony. Approximately six and a half hours after the transcripts were delivered to the jury, it was discovered that the copy of the transcript given to the jury inadvertently contained the record of matters discussed by counsel and the Court in the absence of the jury during avoir dire. As such matters should have been expunged, defence counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis that the proceedings had become tainted and the trial was unfair. The main objectionable passage reads as follows: GLAZER [Defence counsel]: I beg to disagree, My Lady. The law as I understand it is -- for example, My Lady had ruled that certain comments by the accused are inadmissible. If the witness during the course of his testimony refers to those comments as forming the basis of some of his opinion, it would be grounds for a mistrial. He can only refer to what is before the jury; he can't refer to evidence that is not before the jury. 50The defence argued that the jury had learned that the appellant had made comments that were ruled inadmissible. In the defence's view, the jury would speculate as to the nature of those comments and would draw an adverse inference against the appellant. The trial judge denied the request for a mistrial. She ordered, however, that the offending transcripts be retrieved and that the jury be provided with clean copies.",

    "text": "A.Overview 3On March 15, 1995, Gerald Regan, by that time a former Premier of Nova Scotia, was charged with a long list of sexual offences, against a variety of women who had worked for or with him, dating back to the 1950s. The stories of alleged abuse had taken a long and winding path before finally surfacing. First, a CBC journalist spoke to a number of women who told of abusive acts they had allegedly suffered at the hands of the appellant. But that journalist did not broadcast the story. Several years later, while doing some research of his own, an avowed political foe of the appellant uncovered the information from the aborted news report. This informant took the stories to the police in July of 1993, and in September, an RCMP task force launched an investigation. During the investigation, a police officer responded to a reporter's request to confirm or deny that the appellant was under investigation. The police confirmed — a public admission which was in violation of police policy to remain silent about individual suspects until charges are laid. More than 300 interviews later, and 18 months after the story first broke about the Regan investigation, charges were laid. B.The Charges 4The decision to lay charges also has a convoluted history. At the conclusion of the police investigation, a report dated March 30, 1994 was submitted to the province's then Director of Public Prosecutions (\"DPP\"), John Pearson, with a request for his opinion about the laying of charges. The report identified 22 women complainants. Among them were six women who had been Regan's babysitters, one who had been his housekeeper, a political intern, a legislative page, a secretary, and a political reporter. The women were all young at the time of the alleged assaults, ranging in age from 14 to 24 years. One woman alleged she was raped when she was 14, two others alleged attempted rape. The other incidents involved sexual touching, exposure and kissing.",

    "text": "One woman alleged she was raped when she was 14, two others alleged attempted rape. The other incidents involved sexual touching, exposure and kissing. The police report categorized the charges this way: - three complainants who \"may have been victims of sexual impropriety\", but in the opinion of the police were not victims of criminal acts (although the acts showed a \"modus operandi\"); - six complainants who the police believed were victims of criminal offences, but who were \"not willing to testify in a court of law\"; - four complainants who were considered victims of criminal offences, but who did not want to testify as complainants, and were only willing to \"co-operate by providing similar fact evidence at trial\"; - and nine complainants of criminal acts who were willing to testify as complainants. Of these nine, one of them alleged the attack had occurred in Calgary, Alberta. 5DPP Pearson responded to police by letter dated June 28, 1994, that he and two other prosecutors had reviewed the file. One of those was Susan Potts, then Senior Crown Attorney in charge of sexual assault prosecutions. Pearson recommended that charges should be laid involving four of the eight Nova Scotia-based complainants who were willing to testify. He chose the incidents which involved the most serious physical violations, including rape, attempted rape, and the one case where it was alleged the appellant had exposed his penis. 6In the other four local cases of willing complainants, DPP Pearson recommended that the police not proceed with charges. These cases involved many similar accounts of the appellant trying to grope and \"French kiss\" the victim. DPP Pearson explained that although these acts would have been against the law at the time, \"the allegations are minor in nature, especially when placed in the context of societal values at the time\", and the \"staleness\" of the offences outweighed their \"gravity\". He thought that the minor charges could be sanctioned by proceeding against the more major ones, and he feared that otherwise the prosecution might appear to be a \"persecution\". 7In addition, DPP Pearson advised that \"the case against Regan would be significantly enhanced if some of the more recent incidents were proceeded with\". He recommended that the police re-contact the six women who had been victims of apparent criminal conduct, but were unwilling to testify.",

He made no recommendation about the complainants who had apparently been victims of criminal behaviour, but were only willing to give similar fact evidence.

He advised the police that \"you are not obliged to accept our opinion and that the final charging decision rests with you. We are also cognizant of the duties and responsibilities of Crown Counsel to consider whether or not it is appropriate to proceed with charges once they have been laid.\" He suggested that police investigators \"meet with [Crown counsel] Susan Potts to finalize the wording of any charge [the police] decide to proceed with\". 8The police did not agree with DPP Pearson's charging recommendation. They were of the view that a more complete picture of the allegations against the appellant should be put before the court. Chief Superintendent Falkingham testified: . . . over the several years I saw a pattern and an MO that Mr. Regan sexually assaulted, in my view, a number of young teenagers. . . . The MO was with babysitters, the MO was with – when he had an opportunity to be alone with a young girl, and I felt that that was all building into a large picture which indicated to me that there was a continuing criminal offence in my mind, together – as a global investigation. . . . My view is the matter of charges had to involve the large number of complainants and as a result of them – the continued offences over the years. . . . 9After the Crown joined police in re-interviewing most of the original complainants, 16 counts for sex-related offences, involving 11 women, were laid against the appellant on March 15, 1995. On May 30, 1995, a revised information was sworn, which added two new complainants and three new counts, for a total of 19 counts related to 13 women. 10The matter proceeded to a preliminary hearing in April 1996.

C.Crown Conduct 11After DPP Pearson's written recommendations, Crown Potts met with police on July 15, 1994. At that recorded meeting, Crown Potts suggested that it would not be \"advisable\" that charges be brought before a particular judge, because she thought he would have political ties to the appellant. Instead, she said she would \"keep monitoring the court docket to see who is sitting when and what would be in our best interest\" – an exercise commonly known as \"judge shopping\". 12At the same meeting, Potts requested to read all the investigation reports, because \"this would give her a clear picture of what was actually going on\". Notes of a meeting on January 17, 1995, attended by the RCMP Chief Superintendent on the case, confirmed that Potts had by then re-read \"the evidence and the victims' statements\".

(Trial submissions of the Crown, Appellant's Record, p. 1089) 14The re-interviews included 16 of the original 22 complainants: four of the six reluctant witnesses whom DPP Pearson had recommended should be re-approached; three of the four women only willing, at first, to give similar fact evidence; three of the four complainants for whom Pearson had recommended laying charges (the fourth refused to proceed further); all four willing complainants whom the police wanted to charge but for whom DPP Pearson had recommended that no charge be laid; the complainant in the Alberta-based incident; and one of the three complainants for whom, at first, it was thought there was no criminal offence. 15Crown Potts was removed from the prosecution of this case by the time the preliminary inquiry began in April 1996. Crown Adrian Reid stepped in as lead counsel at the preliminary inquiry and trial. Crown Reid became involved with the case in December 1995 after charges were laid. 16Citing the cumulative effect of this Crown behaviour combined with the police premature identification of him as a suspect, the appellant sought a global stay of all of the charges.

    "text": "[57]In this appeal the party admission was something the accused said, that the witness overheard, and that the Crown tendered as evidence of the accused's guilt (Evans, at p. 664; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92). However, party admissions can constitute more than words; the common law has held party admissions to include,inter alia, silence, actions, and demeanour(see, e.g.,R. v. Scott, 2013 MBCA 7, 288 Man. R. (2d) 188; see also Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶¶6.470-6.512; Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 911). As noted by Professor I. Younger, a rule of thumb is that \"[a]nything the other side ever said or did will be admissible so long as it has something to do with the case\" (An Irreverent Introduction to Hearsay(1977), at p. 24, cited in Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92). I do not seek to describe here the precise boundaries of party admissions, as that is not at issue. [58]A trial judge's determination that evidence is hearsay but falls within an exception from the general exclusionary rule is a question of law, reviewable on a standard of correctness. (c)Determine Whether to Use Judicial Discretion to Exclude the Evidence [59]Finally, judges must determine whether they should exercise their discretion to exclude evidence by balancing probative value against prejudicial effect. Judges sitting with juries should consider the extent to which any prejudicial effect can be attenuated by appropriate instructions to the jury as to the use to which the evidence can properly be put. In addition, evidence can be excluded where there was a significant unfairness associated with obtaining it, such that it would render the accused's trial unfair (Mohan;Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 47-48; Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶¶2.75-2.77; Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 905-6). No such consideration arises in the circumstances of this case. [60]Probative value relates to the degree of relevance to trial issues and the strength of inference that can be drawn from evidence . Prejudicial effect relates to the likelihood that a jury will misuse the evidence (Hart,at para. 106; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 52).",

    "text": "Prejudicial effect relates to the likelihood that a jury will misuse the evidence (Hart,at para. 106; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 52). Weighing probative value against prejudicial effect has been referred to as a \"cost benefit analysis\" (Mohan,at pp. 21-22;Hart,at para. 94; Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 905-6). [61]As noted, the \"cost\" associated with the evidence (i.e. the prejudice) can be attenuated by appropriate jury instructions. Proper instructions can effectively equip juries with an understanding of how to use evidence in a judicial manner . [62]A trial judge's determination that the probative value of evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect is discretionary and should be reviewed with deference . In addition, appellate courts are to review alleged errors in jury instructions \"in the context of the entire charge and of the trial as a whole\" so as to afford trial judges \"some flexibility in crafting the language of jury instructions\" (Araya,at para. 39). I would underscore the importance of trial judges providing clear analysis on the probative value and prejudicial effect of the evidence to facilitate appellate review. (2)Application of the Legal Framework to the Circumstances of This Case (a)The Evidence Was Relevant [63]The brother's testimony regarding the overheard conversation was relevant. First, there was sufficient context for the jury to give meaning to the words that the brother overheard, such that the evidence overcomes the low threshold for (logical) relevance. Second, it is not fatal that the brother was uncertain as to the exact words that he heard the accused say. The equivocal nature of the brother's testimony is a factor for consideration when weighing the probative value against the prejudicial effect. It also relates to ultimate reliability and believability; but those are for the trier of fact in weighing the evidence, rather than the judge in the relevance analysis. [64]The trial judge needed to determine whether, on the basis of all the evidence, the jury could give meaning (in a way that was not speculative) to what the brother testified that he overheard. The context extended beyond the narrow scope that the majority of the Court of Appeal applied. Other evidence properly informed the brother's testimony as to what he overheard. In the days leading up to the phone call at issue, the accused and the brother had spoken about the victim.",

[65]I turn now toFerris, the decision of this Court that the trial judge and Court of Appeal below agreed governed the admissibility of the evidence. [66]Ferrisconcerned admissibility of hearsay evidence that the Crown sought to adduce as a party admission. Police arrested Mr. Ferris for murder and brought him to the station. Mr. Ferris asked to make a phone call. An officer placed the call, handed Mr. Ferris the phone, then walked towards his desk. As the officer walked away, he overheard Mr. Ferris say \"I've been arrested\" and then, sometime later, \"I killed David\" (Ferris(C.A.), at para. 7). The trial judge admitted the officer's testimony as to what he heard Mr. Ferris say. Mr. Ferris was convicted by a jury of second degree murder. [67]The Alberta Court of Appeal overturned the trial decision, holding that a properly instructed jury would be unable to ascribemeaningto the words the officer overheard. Words that were incapable of meaning could not be probative of any issue, and, therefore, were not relevant. Evidence that was not relevant was not admissible. The issue was not what weight to ascribe to the officer's testimony, but whether the words he overheard hadanymeaning. The Court observed that \"hearsay rules do not do away with the requirement of relevancy\" . [68]The Court of Appeal explained that the phrase \"I killed David\" could have been an admission.",

[68]The Court of Appeal explained that the phrase \"I killed David\" could have been an admission. It also could have been part of a reply to the question \"what [do] the police think [you] did?\" . The words, \"on their own\", did not \"allow for the proper understanding and appreciation of the meaning of the statement\" . The officer's testimony was inadmissible because the jury could not interpret the meaning of the words without \"gross speculation\" . [69]This Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision inFerrisin the result. In a short, oral judgment, Sopinka J. stated that even if the evidence had relevance, its meaning was \"so speculative and its probative value so tenuous that the trial judge ought to have excluded it on the ground its prejudicial effect overbore its probative value\" (p. 756). On a careful reading, what Sopinka J. said wasnotthat the evidence was inadmissible based on relevance. This Court did not affirm the Court of Appeal's relevance analysis or their application of the principled approach. Rather, Sopinka J. said that even if the testimony was relevant, it should have been excluded after balancing probative value against prejudicial effect. [70]The trial evidence inFerriswas dissimilar to the evidence in this case. InFerris, the accused and the police officer were strangers. There was nothing at all like the circumstances, sequence of events and conversations that led up to what in this case the brother overheard in the accused's conversation with his wife. [71]Again, we must bear in mind the difference between relevance and ultimate reliability. How well the brother could recall the words said by the accused relates to the latter, which is a question for the trier of fact. Few people would remember the exact words used in a recent conversation that they listened to intently. Nonetheless, many of us would be able to recall the gist of that conversation. The rules of evidence must respond to this reality. Probative value analysis and the weight given to the evidence by the trier of fact are sufficient mechanisms to address frailties of memory. These frailties do notalsoneed to be addressed when determining relevance. [72]Ferrisis good law, but must be carefully read.",

Indeed, [translation] \"[e]xclusion of a partial conversation is . . . not automatic and the analysis is above all a contextual one\" (Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 970). I would note its application in three decisions:R. v. Bennight, 2012 BCCA 190, 320 B.C.A.C. 195,R. v. Buttazzoni, 2019 ONCA 645, andR. v. Hummel,2002 YKCA 6, 166 C.C.C. (3d) 30. See alsoR. v. Reierson, 2010 BCCA 381, 259 C.C.C. (3d) 32, at para. 40. [73]Bennightis factually somewhat similar to this case. The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed testimony from a corrections officer who could not recall the particular words that the offender said to her. The court held it was sufficient that \"the witness could testify to both the 'gist' of the statement and the context in which it was made\" . That the officer was unable to remember the precise words said was not pertinent to the judge's relevance analysis: incompleteness was a matter of weight for the jury. The accused argued before this Court thatBennightwas different because the corrections officer heard both sides of the conversation. I find this to be a distinction without a difference. What matters is whether the evidencetends to increase or decrease the probability of a fact, not the particular circumstances in which the evidence arose. [74]InButtazzoni,the Ontario Court of Appeal determined that the trial judge properly admitted \"recounted utterances [that] were described as 'almost verbatim'\", andalsoproperly admitted recounted utterances that were a \"paraphrased synopsis\" . Issues with accuracy of recollection did not relate to relevance, but were an issue of weight for the trier of fact. Similarly toBennight, the witness overheard both sides of the conversation. However, as noted, that is not a principled basis on which to distinguish these decisions from the circumstances in this appeal. [75]The accused inHummelargued on appeal that the trial judge improperly admitted testimony that suggested he said \"I hear a woman's voice calling my name\" and \"from a grave\" . The Yukon Court of Appeal held there was \"ample context in which the words could be considered\", as the accused had uttered the words the morning after the victim was last seen alive and there was other evidence connecting him to the victim's disappearance .",

[76]These decisions illustrate thatFerrisshould not be understood as standing for the proposition that incomplete recollection of a party admission leads to exclusion of such evidence or that it is only \"micro context\" that can inform meaning and, thus, relevance. In assessing (logical) relevance, what matters is whether the evidence tends to increase or decrease the probability of the existence of a fact at issue (Arp, at para. 38). [77]Although he could not remember the exact words the accused said, the brother's testimony was that he overheard a phone call in which the accused admitted to killing Ms. Kogawa. The brother's recollection of the phone call, if believed by the jury, (to use the words fromArp) \"tend[s] to 'increase . . . the probability'\" that the accused was responsible for the victim's death. In light of other evidence, the brother's evidence was capable of non-speculative meaning and relevant. (b)The Evidence Was Hearsay, but Subject to the Party Admissions Exception to the Exclusionary Rule [78]The Crown adduced the brother's evidence for the purpose of showing that the accused admitted to killing Ms. Kogawa. This evidence was hearsay and, thus, inadmissible under the general exclusionary rule. However, the brother's evidence was that the accused had, by his words, admitted responsibility for Ms. Kogawa's death. This evidence is something that a party said or did and relates to an issue at trial (see Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92; Younger, at p. 24). As such, the evidence is a party admission and comes within a recognized exception to the general exclusionary rule. (c)In Light of the Comprehensive Jury Instructions, the Trial Judge Did Not Err by Admitting the Evidence [79]The balancing of probative weight against prejudicial effect can be critical in deciding the admissibility of a party admission. This is a discretionary decision by the trial judge. Such decisions are to be reviewed with deference. The accused has not shown error in this exercise of the trial judge's discretion. This is particularly so in light of the well-structured instructions provided to the jury on appropriate use of the party admission. [80]The brother's testimony contained weaknesses.

He was unsure of the particular words that the accused said. He testified that he was not trying to listen and that he only heard one side of the conversation. He did not know whether the accused was responding to questions from his wife. The brother admitted he consumed alcohol before and after the call and that the accused was under the influence of intoxicants. The brother testified that the accused's speech was impacted by the heroin he had taken. These factors decreased the probative value of the party admission. [81]With respect to the prejudicial effect, I agree with Arbour J., dissenting, but not on this point, that juries are likely to give significant weight to confession-like evidence . This Court has recognized the significant potential for prejudicial use of confessions (see, e.g.,Hart, at para. 106) and this party admission was akin to a confession. The possibility for prejudicial use by the jury was real. [82]When balancing the probative value and prejudicial effect, the trial judge noted \"[t]he prejudicial effect can be ameliorated by a strong caution to the jury about what use can be made of the evidence\" . The trial judge provided such a caution on the proper use of the admission at issue. This demonstrates the trial judge was mindful of potential prejudice. The trial judge told the jury that it was up to them to decide whether the statements attributed by the brother to the accused had been made. They were to \"[c]onsider the circumstances in which the conversation took place [and to b]ear in mind anything else that may make the witness's evidence more or less reliable\" (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 197). The trial judge methodically addressed the weaknesses in the brother's testimony in the jury instructions. She emphasized that the brother heard only one side of the conversation and that he did not recall the exact words that the accused said. She noted that the accused had consumed alcohol and heroin prior to the call, and that those intoxicants could have affected what he said.",

The judge made clear that it was for the jury to determine whether the accused had used a particular phrase and what was meant by it. The judge told the jury they could ignore the admission if they were uncertain as to what was said or what it meant. She told the jury that they could not rely on the brother's testimony as to the accused's state of mind. Rather, it was for the jury to consider such matters. [83]The trial judge provided the jury with clear and effective instructions on proper use of the brother's testimony. The instructions gave the jury the guidance needed to weigh the evidence in accordance with legal principles. As such, the instructions effectively and adequately limited the possibility of prejudicial use. [84]In light of the foregoing, the trial judge did not err in admitting the brother's testimony as to what he overheard the accused say. B.Jury Question Issue [85]I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of the Court of Appeal on the Jury Question Issue. The jury's question was not ambiguous and the trial judge answered it correctly. Notwithstanding my agreement, I wish to underscore two points. [86]First, the accused argues on appeal that the jury question demonstrated confusion as to the intent needed for murder and that needed for manslaughter. However, the accused's counsel at trial (not appellate counsel) was adamant that this wasnotwhat the jury's question related to. That trial counsel advocated for a certain response to a jury's question is not determinative of the issue on appeal, but it is an important factor for consideration . While the burden of perfection should not be placed on trial counsel, they are the ones most attuned to the accused's interests. In this case, trial counsel pivoted away from intent and suggested that the trial judge provide to the jury an \"expanded definition of bodily harm\" (A.R., vol. III, at p. 330). This approach likely represented trial counsel's view as to how to answer the question correctly, in a manner beneficial to his client.",

I see no error in the trial judge's handling of the question, particularly in light of trial counsel's submissions on this point. [87]Second, there is no merit to the accused's argument that the definition of \"bodily harm\" in s. 2 of theCriminal Codedoes not apply to s. 229(a)(ii), which defines murder. The meaning of the phrase \"bodily harm\" is consistent throughout theCriminal Code. When Parliament means to deviate from the meaning of \"bodily harm\", it does so by adding qualifying words (e.g., \"grievous bodily harm\" in s. 25(3)). No authority from this Court, includingR. v. Miljevic, 2011 SCC 8, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 203, should be read as suggesting otherwise. The accused's argument that murder requires bodily harm that is serious, dangerous or grave seems to stem from an inaccurate understanding of the model jury instructions. The words that he suggests describe bodily harm — dangerous, serious, grave — concern foreseeability. To reiterate, the definition of \"bodily harm\" set out in s. 2 applies to s. 229(a)(ii). VI.Conclusion [88]I would allow the Crown's appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the accused's conviction for second degree murder. The following are the reasons delivered by [89]Karakatsanis and Brown JJ. (dissenting) — We would dismiss this appeal. We do not disagree with our colleagues' framework for assessing relevance and probative value. What divides us is its application here. In our view, for the reasons of Justice Goepel at the Court of Appeal, a jury could not ascertain the meaning or relevance of the overheard statements (2021 BCCA 41, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 131). As well, their prejudicial effect outweighed any tenuous probative value they may have had. The overheard statements were inadmissible. [90]On the evidence before the jury, it was impossible to know what Schneider said to his wife during the overheard phone call. The witness, Schneider's brother, did not know the words that he heard. He was deliberately tryingnotto listen to the 13‐minute conversation. He neither participated in the conversation nor heard both sides of it. He acknowledged that he did not know what was said, and did not even recall knowing the substance of what was said.",

He acknowledged that he did not know what was said, and did not even recall knowing the substance of what was said. Initially, he testified in examination‐in‐chief that he heard Schneider say, \"I did it. I killed her\" about half‐way into the phone call (A.R., vol. II, at p. 170). He then clarified that he could not say those were the exact words spoken but that this was \"the gist\" of Schneider's side of the conversation (A.R., vol. II, at p. 171). It appears that this \"gist\" was derived from a statement he had heard six or seven minutes earlier in the conversation and, the Crown says, from the trauma of having accompanied his brother during a suicide attempt. In cross‐examination, the witness confirmed that because he did not know Schneider's exact words, they may have just been something like \"I did it\" and that the words — whatever they were — could have come at the beginning, middle or end of a longer sentence (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 189‐90). [91]At trial, the Crown sought to tender the words overheard by Schneider's brother as an admission of responsibility for the death of the victim, Natsumi Kogawa. In closing submissions, the Crown stated that Schneider was overheard telling his wife \"I did it\" or \"I killed her\" ⸺ though also acknowledging the exact words spoken were unknown ⸺ and told the jury that \"you can infer from these words that he intended to kill Natsumi Kogawa or meant to kill Natsumi Kogawa\" (A.R., vol. III, at p. 286). [92]Assessing the relevance of Schneider's brother's testimony (including the Crown's own interpretive gloss thereon) is an exercise in pure speculation. The Crown's reliance on \"context\" to assist in identifying the relevance of the witness's \"gist\" of the conversation is not only a strain; it is also far more harmful than it is helpful.",

For the Crown, this \"context\" includes the fact that the brother knew Schneider, that they had talked about the victim in the days leading up to the phone call, that Schneider told his brother some details of his relationship with Ms. Kogawa and that her body could be found in a suitcase prior to the phone conversation, that the brother was physically present for the phone conversation and the attempted suicide, and that he had an understanding of the \"tone\" of the conversation. These factors add nothing to the assessment of what had been said during the phone call. [93]Our colleagues overstate the significance of the Court of Appeal's references to the \"macro\" and \"micro\" contexts (Rowe J.'s reasons, at paras. 6, 28 and 42). These statements were not intended to alter assessments of relevance. Rather, they were simply shorthand for what the majority and the dissent considered to be the relevant context. Justice DeWitt‐Van Oosten took a broader view of the relevant context (which, in our respectful view, overreached by considering the same irrelevant factors as the Crown), while Justice Goepel (correctly) confined himself to considering the context arising from the conversation itself. This is not to say that context beyond the immediate conversation can never inform the meaning of statements made within the conversation. Rather, in this case, the Crown relies on contextual features beyond the conversation itself that were irrelevant, and there was insufficient context arising from the conversation itself to inform the meaning of the overheard statements. [94]In our view, the Crown relies on \"context\" that is not only irrelevant, but which augments the prejudicial effect of admitting the statements even if they were relevant. The jury may have focused on aspects of the context which tended to implicate Schneider in the death ⸺ such as his statement about where Ms. Kogawa's body was located ⸺ to reason that Schneider must have therefore admitted responsibility for the death.

That finding would then be used to raise the probability of guilt to a conclusion of guilt. The danger implicit in that type of circuitous reasoning is obvious. This very concern arises in the instant case where the jury was left to assess the logical relevance of a \"gist\", unaccompanied by any recollection of what was said, or at least any recollection of the substance of what was said. [95]The trial judge did not explicitly identify any dangers of admitting the evidence of the overheard statements or how they might impact the fairness of the trial. She simply concluded that \"[t]he prejudicial effect can be ameliorated by a strong caution to the jury about what use can be made of the evidence\" (2018 BCSC 2546, at para. 21, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 5). In our view, the jury instruction did not cure the prejudice. It presupposed that the jury could decide what Schneider said despite having no basis in the evidence to do so. [96]We conclude that the evidence of the overheard statements should not have been admitted. We acknowledge that the threshold for logical relevance is low. But it is stilla threshold, in that it must \"increase or diminish the probability of the existence of a fact in issue\" , at p. 83). If Schneider's brother's testimony meets this threshold, it would be difficult to conceive of anything Schneider might have said (or might be felt to have said), howsoever partial, oblique or indistinct, that wouldnotbe \"relevant\". In any event, when the potential for misuse is measured against the absence of any significant probative value, the result is that the evidence should have been removed from the jury's consideration altogether.

They lived in a small village in central British Columbia and were acquaintances. The impact threw her, apparently injured, on the hood of his truck and she shouted, \"You're in trouble now.\" The appellant told the undercover officer that he panicked and killed her by striking her on the head with a blunt instrument. He provided many details of the killing, including where the killing took place and how he disposed of her body and clothing, and how he had made it look as though she had been the victim of a sexual assault. 20The Crown conceded that without evidence of the appellant's statements to the undercover officer, \"the prosecution's case collapsed\". 21The alleged confession came about because skillful police work persuaded the appellant over a period of months that undercover officers were all part of a very well‐run criminal enterprise which the appellant might care to join. Early in the operation, the appellant advised one of the officers that the police did not like him. When asked why, the appellant said, \"They think I did a murder, they think I killed this broad.\" He continued to deny his involvement until towards the end of January 1997. In the interim, he became ever more entangled in the supposed crime organization. 22The police officer's evidence was that on January 29, 1997, in a room at the Landis Hotel in Vancouver, he told the appellant that through underworld contacts he could find someone suffering a terminal illness to make a false confession to the murder of Jo Anne Feddema provided the appellant supplied sufficient detail to make the confession believable. At that point the appellant freely confessed to the murder, and on the following day took him to the various locations associated with the crime and described the events in detail. The conversation of January 30th was also recorded but, unlike the tape made in the hotel room, it was of poor quality. 23The police had applied for and obtained an authorization under Part VI of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The conversations of January 29 and 30, 1997 were recorded pursuant to the authorization. Transcripts were prepared. The undercover officer reviewed the transcripts the day after each conversation took place, and made corrections based on listening to the tape supplemented with his recollection of those conversations. A.The Evidentiary Rulings 24The trial judge having concluded that the authorization ought to have been refused for insufficiency of evidence, and the tape therefore having been obtained in violation ofs. 8of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the tapes and related transcripts were declared inadmissible. 25The appellant then moved to suppress the evidence of the undercover police officer because he said it was inextricably bound up with the transcripts of the tapes that had been ruled inadmissible. The trial judge ruled that the officer could give evidence \"as to his present recollection of what occurred in that hotel room on January 29th\" and, for that purpose, he could make use of the corrected transcripts (euphemistically described as his \"notes\") to refresh his memory. He had not in fact made notes of the conversation, believing that the tape itself, having been authorized, would be admissible. 26This appeal, and the disputed ruling, relate only to the January 29th conversation at the Landis Hotel. B.The Officer's Evidence on the Voir Dire 27In the witness box, the officer's evidence followed closely, often word for word, the corrected transcript of the January 29th conversation. When challenged by the defence, he explained in avoir direthat, within a day of the original conversation, he had received a typed transcript of the tapes. He took the tape and the transcribed copy of the tape \"and I proofread the transcribed copy with the tape and I made changes on it. Also adding comments of my own. I then sent that back to be retyped with my corrections and my comments and I received back the corrected copy\". The original document showing his handwritten changes and corrections was not entered in evidence. The retyped \"corrected\" version is 49 pages in length, double-spaced.

And there would be some, presumably, areas where you felt you could make out words and you wrote those in? And that was from the tape? The tape as well as my memory of the conversation itself. 28Later, when it was suggested to him by defence counsel that the officer's present recollection of the January 29th conversation was \"inextricably bound\" up with his subsequent review of the tape and the transcript, he responded: No, I have a definite independent recollection of the meeting between myself and Mr. Fliss on January 29th,'97. Do you have any notes of that independent recollection? Well, no. . . . Q. . . . the only note you have of the content of the conversation is what you have referred to as your notes which you have been reading from and which are a transcript from the taped cassette of a wiretap of the conversation, correct? Yes. 29The trial judge found that the officer created a corrected transcript that could properly be described as his \"notes\". He permitted the officer to give in testimony what was \"basically a recitation\" of the corrected transcript. C.The Verdict 30The jury, apparently accepting some evidence that death was caused while the appellant was committing or attempting to commit an aggravated sexual assault, returned with a verdict of first degree murder. 31On appeal, because of the conflicting evidence of the Crown's experts with respect to the alleged sexual assault, a verdict of second degree murder was substituted. The appeal was otherwise dismissed, Southin J.A. dissenting. In her view, theviva voceevidence of the officer was inadmissible and the conviction ought to have been quashed. The appellant now appeals as of right to this Court on the question of law raised by Southin J.A.'s dissent, namely whether the trial judge erred in admitting theviva voceevidence of the police officer of his conversation with the appellant on January 29, 1997, having previously ruled that evidence of the transcript of that same conversation was inadmissible.",

    "text": "4The respondent met the complainant, a 20-year-old woman, in a bar and offered to drive her to a pre-arranged meeting with her friends. En route, he indicated that he had to stop at his home and invited her in. He then proceeded to kiss her, against her protestations, and he pushed her down onto a sofa. He held her there, against her will, undressed her and penetrated her vagina with his penis. He then turned her around and penetrated her anus. He turned her again and at this point she realized that he was inserting an object into her vagina. In her evidence she described that object as a stick, which she thought at the time might be a billiard queue. The instrument used by the accused to penetrate the victim was a decorated bamboo dildo, which the respondent said he had purchased as a sexual aid in a shop in Mexico. This dildo is in the shape of a baseball bat, and is approximately 24 inches long. Although the complainant thought that the large end of the stick had been used to penetrate her, the samples taken for DNA analysis revealed that it is the thin end of the dildo that was inserted into her vagina. 5The complainant testified that the respondent's assault hurt her, and that she was bleeding afterwards. She had recently had a uterine infection and thought that this might have contributed to the bleeding. The respondent denied sexually assaulting the complainant. He claimed that she was a consenting partner and that she had responded enthusiastically to his advances. As for the use of the dildo, he testified that the complainant had used it to masturbate herself. He admitted that this object belonged to him and said that he had used it in the past with several other partners as a sexual stimulant. 6The trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant, gave detailed reasons as to why he did not accept the respondent's version and concluded that there was no doubt that the accused had committed a sexual assault with a weapon. He did so without reference to the definition of \"weapon\" ins. 2of theCriminal Code. 7The Court of Appeal reversed the conviction for sexual assault with a weapon, substituted a conviction for the included offence of sexual assaultsimpliciter, and reduced the sentence accordingly.",

He, for example, alleged that at one time she had thrown a beer glass at him and, at another time, had slashed at his knees with a hammer. On one occasion, he said, he went to the RCMP \"with my face busted open\" and was advised, he says, \"to get out of the relationship\". The separation was not amicable, at least as described by the respondent: So I got my friend Martin to come up with me and when I got up there she [Ms. Noseworthy] was kicking the . . . trying to kick the door in on my shed. And I unlocked it and let her get her chair and Christmas stuff and ah, she give me a couple of punches in the face again then and threw a rock at me trying to beat the window out of my house and ah, beat the back window out of me truck, and ah, threw a stick and hit me in the face with it. Just kept on going on and on like. The respondent says that when he decided to go his own way, she threatened him saying, \"I hope you live your life in misery. If I have anything to do with it, you will.\" At trial she testified that \"Maybe I did say it. Maybe I did.\" 7During their year and a half together the respondent, then unemployed, had been renovating a house. Two days after the break-up, Ms. Noseworthy went to the police to inform them that the respondent had a month or so previously confessed to stealing two windows from a local building supplies dealer. Her description of the allegedly stolen goods, in its entirety, was \"vinyl windows, two-pane. They were the . . . they rolled out, one side\". The local building supplies dealer was contacted. Despite the lapse of time since the alleged theft, he was unaware of it. He then checked his inventory and confirmed that two 40 x 36 inch vinyl windows were missing from a truck parked across the road from his shop, which was used for storage.",

    "text": "3The late Basant Singh Dhaliwal arrived from India to live in Canada with his parents about a month before he was shot and killed. He had been watching a volleyball tournament with a collection of new friends. After the games a group of about 15 individuals were standing around socializing. 4A van, allegedly owned and driven by the respondent, Sukhminder Braich, approached the group shortly after 5 p.m. with its side door open. When it drew abreast, a burst of gun fire, variously estimated at between \"a few\" to 12 seconds in duration swept the victim group, shooting on a low trajectory into the ground. Basant Singh Dhaliwal, who happened to be kneeling, was killed instantly. Three companions, Ajaib Biln, Amarjit Tatla and Jarnail Dhaliwal, were wounded in the legs. Tatla's thumb was also hit. It was alleged that the respondent Ajmer Braich was the shooter. The van then sped away. Sukhminder Braich's van was found in a Safeway parking lot, freshly cleaned inside and out, a few days later. It had not been reported stolen. The two respondents are brothers. 5The only alleged motive for the shooting was a scuffle a week previously between the alleged shooter, Ajmer Braich, and his circle of friends with Jarnail Dhaliwal, one of the victims, and his circle of friends in the Rotary Stadium area in Mission, B.C. Witnesses testified that Jarnail Dhaliwal had slapped Ajmer Braich with an open hand. The trial judge commented that \"[t]he scuffle resulted in some torn shirts, hurt feelings, no apparent injuries.\" The participants on each occasion were largely acquainted with each other, and there was no evidence of previous bad blood. The motive for the respondents to kill members of the victim group was, accordingly, rather weak. A.The Identification Evidence 6The respondents were convicted primarily, if not exclusively, on the basis of eyewitness identification. 7In oral reasons for judgment, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Jarnail Dhaliwal (who, as stated, had delivered the slap) that Sukhminder Braich was the driver of the van. He had known Sukhminder Braich for about 10 to 12 years and was looking directly at the slow-moving van when he was shot.",

The trial judge also accepted the evidence of Sher Braich, who was described as a \"leader of the victim group\", that Sukhminder Braich was the driver and Ajmer Braich was the shooter. With respect to the evidence of Jarnail Dhaliwal and Sher Braich, the trial judge found: Both of these men had an absolutely clear view on a clear day and, even in a brief span of time with a van moving very slowly past them, they were both very familiar with both of these defendants and I have no doubt, therefore, that their identification is the truth. 8A third eyewitness, Samshir Uppal, also purported to identify the shooter, but his evidence was rejected because of prior inconsistent statements to a newspaper that \"we never even seen those people\". The trial judge found some of the other evidence from members of the victim group to be similarly unreliable. 9Neither respondent testified at trial. 10The next-door neighbour of Sukhminder Braich observed him driving his van, a two-tone GMC minivan, licence FHX-769, between 1:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. the day of the shooting. Witnesses variously described the last three digits of the shooting van as 769, 789 or 679. 11With respect to the identification evidence accepted by the trial judge, McEachern C.J.B.C. said that I have carefully examined the evidence, and I have re-weighed it to some extent. In view of the very positive identifications made by the two key Crown witnesses, it cannot be said that there is not some evidence that supports the judge's verdict. I cannot say that upon a proper consideration of all of the evidence, no properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could convict. ((2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 467, 2000 BCCA 184, at para. 52) 12The trial judge, noting the low trajectory of the line of fire, concluded that the respondents lacked themens reafor murder. They were accordingly convicted of manslaughter. They were also convicted of aggravated assault in relation to the other victims rather than attempted murder. They were each sentenced to nine years in jail on the manslaughter count, with lesser sentences on the convictions for the non-fatal shootings to run concurrently.",

    "text": "3The accused, Jacques Cinous, was charged with the first degree murder of a criminal accomplice, Michaelson Vancol (\"Mike\"), at a gas station in Montréal on the evening of February 3, 1994. Despite his claim to having acted in self-defence, the accused was found guilty of second degree murder on October 21, 1995. 4The accused testified that he and a friend, Josue Laforest (\"Kent\"), had been involved in the theft and resale of computers since August 1993, an activity from which he earned approximately $5,000 per week. Another accomplice, Yves Louis (\"Ice\"), and the victim were also involved in some of these thefts. 5Approximately one month before the killing, at the beginning of January 1994, the accused described an incident during which his gun disappeared. According to the accused, one night that January, he, Ice and Mike went out to steal some computers. The presence of a security guard and other employees on the targeted premises forced them to abandon the theft. The accused testified that when he returned home that evening, he found that his gun was missing. This was a 9-millimetre gun the accused said he had acquired some weeks after his release from jail, in April 1993, and had carried with him every day since. Convinced that Mike had stolen the weapon, the accused said that he decided that from then on he would have no more contact with either Ice or Mike. This gun has never resurfaced. There is no evidence that it was stolen or that Mike in fact stole it. It was not on Mike the night of the killing and is not alleged to have been involved in the events of that night. 6The accused testified that he spoke with Ice and Mike on the phone the day after the gun disappeared. Since he wanted no more to do with them, he said he would leave the money he owed them with his cousin ($800 for each of them). He also told them that there would be no more thefts because the police had him under surveillance. The accused testified that Ice and Mike nevertheless called him every day, several times a day, and would show up at the door at unexpected times wanting to do thefts with him.",

He also testified that four or five days after the gun went missing, he began to hear rumours that Mike and Ice wanted to kill him, and that he was warned by a friend to watch out for them. He had his cousin, whom he lived with, block their phone calls. He testified that he managed to avoid them for three weeks to a month, but, on cross-examination, admitted to some contact with them during that period. 7On the morning of February 3, 1994, at 7:00 a.m., Mike and Ice called the accused and asked him to participate in a computer theft. The accused agreed to meet with them that evening at his apartment, at 7:00 p.m.; nevertheless, he claimed that he had no intention of going out to steal the computers and thought they might not even come. That evening, Kent arrived at the accused's apartment by 6:00 p.m., and Mike and Ice arrived at approximately 7:00 or 7:15 p.m. The accused testified that Mike and Ice kept their jackets on and whispered to one another as they sat in his living room watching television. The accused said he saw Ice constantly placing his hand inside his coat and that made him suspect the two were armed. He asked, and they told him they were not armed. He said that he decided to participate in the theft with them to see if they really intended to kill him, to find out whether or not the rumours were true. 8Although the accused described what had gone on as suspicious, he did not argue that coercion was used to obtain his consent to participate in this theft or any of the previous thefts. There was no evidence led to indicate that Mike had previously assaulted the accused or threatened him in order to obtain his consent to participate in thefts, nor was there a suggestion that Mike had assaulted or threatened to assault the accused on any other occasion, for any reason. 9The four left the apartment and got into the accused's van in order to drive to the location of the computer theft.",

The accused testified that Mike tarried in a nearby alley before coming to the van and got in wearing surgical latex gloves. Neither of these gloves were the black woolen gloves that the accused said were kept in the glove compartment of the van for thefts. Moreover, the surgical latex gloves Mike wore were the type of gloves that the accused said he associated with situations where bloodshed was expected and that he had twice before seen used on \"burns\" — attacks on criminals by other criminals. 10There was no evidence led to suggest that surgical latex gloves carried any particular significance as a gang practice in their case or in general, e.g. that their use would indicate (i) bloodshed (as opposed to preventing fingerprints from being left during a theft), and (ii) bloodshed that would be specifically directed against a co-criminal (a \"burn\").

The accused said that he had seen them being worn by hit men in movies. 11In the van, Kent was sitting directly behind the accused, who was driving.

C-46,to uphold the conviction on the basis that any errors in the directions on self-defence are immaterial since the accused's claim to self-defence lacked any\"air of reality\"and should never have been put to the jury. According to the Crown, no retrial is required since, without the defence, the verdict would necessarily have been the same: the accused would have been convicted of murder. 19The accused responds by saying that there was an air of reality to the defence since this threshold test requires only\"some\"evidence in order for the defence to be put to the jury and the accused's own testimony satisfies this requirement.",

He had been stabbed in the chest and died a short time later at St. Michael's Hospital. The subsequent autopsy confirmed that he had received a single knife wound to the heart. 7On August 12, 1998, Donna Robertson told two homicide detectives that her then boyfriend, the appellant, David Benson, had told her that he was the person who had killed Baksh. According to Robertson's account, Benson told her that he had gone out to the fire escape one night when he could not sleep. A man with an accent approached him and offered to sell him drugs. Benson declined, but he persisted and put his arm around Benson. Benson told the man to \"back off\" and, when he refused, Benson pulled a knife and stabbed him. The man then staggered away through the adjacent park and then west toward Barrington Avenue. Benson threw away the clothes that he was wearing, except for his shoes. 8Robertson also told the police that Benson told her that he had confessed to his lawyers, Edward Greenspan, and later Todd Ducharme and Peter Copeland. She said that she had gone with Benson to meet Mr. Copeland, and that he had provided them with business cards on which he wrote words that purported to invoke the right to silence in the face of police questioning. Robertson produced her card to the police. 9The police investigated Benson in relation to the homicide for a number of months. The investigation included a consent wiretap of Robertson's home telephone and the interception of her communications with Benson using a body pack. Armed with a search warrant, the police seized clothing, knives and footwear from Benson's residence. All items tested negative for the blood of the deceased. Benson has since denied killing Baksh. Benson was never charged with respect to the murder and the investigation against him was dropped. 10The respondent Jason Brown was seen looking for Baksh on the morning that Baksh was killed. Brown was also looking for a mountain bike that he had allegedly fronted to Baksh as part of a drug deal. Witnesses stated that Brown had in his possession a napkin, on which Baksh's pager number was written in red ink.",

A videotape showed Brown entering his own apartment building, located one block from the crime scene, at 4:47 a.m. on July 21, 1998, less than an hour after Baksh had been found stabbed. 11On July 29, 1998, under warrant, the police seized from Brown's apartment, among other things, a napkin with the deceased's pager number on it. Brown entered his apartment during the search and provided a statement to the police in which he denied knowing the deceased, denied knowing anything about a mountain bike, and said that he had been home on the night of the homicide. 12On July 31, 1998, with counsel present, Brown gave a second statement to the police. In this statement, he said that he had bought cocaine from the deceased three times on the night and early morning of the homicide. On the third such time, Brown said that he had no money and therefore fronted a stolen mountain bike for more cocaine. Brown wanted the bike back and said that he would bring money later for the cocaine. He denied killing Baksh. 13Brown was charged with Baksh's murder on November 1, 1999. Prior to that date, the police claimed to lack reasonable and probable grounds to charge either Benson or Brown with the homicide. Brown's charge came shortly after a jailhouse informant, who had shared a cell with Brown at the Toronto jail in November 1998, reported that he had overheard a conversation between Brown and a third inmate, McDoom. According to the informant, Brown told McDoom that he had purchased drugs from Baksh, stabbed him, and taken a bag of crack cocaine. 14Although the informant was called as a witness at the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor has not yet received the approval of the \"In-Custody Informer Committee\" within the office of the Attorney General to call the informant at trial. The Committee is waiting for the final determination of Brown'sMcClureapplication and a further determination of whether the Crown may review the material ordered disclosed to Brown in order to assess the reliability of the informant.",

    "text": "7In stating the verdict, the foreperson coughed or stuttered, causing listeners to hear different verdicts. The verdict as pronounced was never repeated or confirmed by the court. Although the trial judge thought he heard \"not guilty as charged\", later that same afternoon, he admitted to having \"a raging head cold\" and acknowledged that there was something \"unusual\" about the verdict. The court reporter initially recorded the foreperson's verdict as \"(inaudible) guilty as charged\" and, when examined the next day, testified that he \"couldn't be sure\" what the foreperson said at the moment of hearing it. Even after replaying the original tape in the courtroom \"eight to twelve\" times, he was unable to discern what the verdict was (albeit at \"normal speed\" he heard \"guilty as charged\"). The court officer testified that she had been unable to understand the foreperson due to a \"rumbling\" or \"gurgling\" noise he made while delivering the verdict. Ten of the eleven jurors testified under oath that they heard the foreperson say \"guilty\", the eleventh stated that she was not able to hear the verdict as announced. The foreperson testified that he sometimes stammered and also had a soft tone of voice, but that he had said \"guilty as charged\". 8Also significant in this case is the manner in which the error was brought to the attention of the court. After the verdict was announced on September 18, the jury was escorted by the court officer from the courtroom to the jury room. Within about 30 seconds after leaving the courtroom, the court officer asked the foreperson what the verdict was. At this point, all 12 jurors were back in the jury room and still within the care and control of the court. In the presence of all of the other members of the jury, the foreperson replied, \"You're kidding, guilty\". Although some of the jurors were in a position to overhear what was said, none of them contradicted the foreperson's statement. The jurors were then escorted down a private elevator in order to exit the building, which is typical when there is a guilty verdict. On the way back to her office, the court officer heard that the court deputy had said that the verdict was \"not guilty\".",

She testified that she knew immediately that an error had been made. 9Within approximately seven to nine minutes after the announcement of the verdict in court, the court officer informed the trial judge of the error. Two constables at the court found the foreperson and another juror in the parking lot. Both jurors were alone and separately confirmed to one of the constables that the verdict was guilty. Within about 25 minutes of the discharge of the appellant, the trial judge had the foreperson and the other juror back in court. Under oath, the foreperson confirmed to the trial judge that the jury's verdict was guilty and that he had pronounced a guilty verdict in the courtroom. In my view, there is no question of the foreperson's verdict being altered as a result of anything he heard after returning the initial verdict; any possibility that he was tainted after exiting the building into the parking lot is completely mitigated by the fact that he had already disclosed the error to the court officer while still within the care and control of the court. 10Around the time the trial judge was questioning the foreperson, the court officer called the remaining 10 jurors at their homes and asked them to return to the courthouse. She also asked one of the jurors on the phone \"off the record\" what the verdict was; like the foreperson and the other juror found in the parking lot, the juror said \"guilty\".",

    "text": "[140]The judge then read the two subsections of s. 21, which relate to party liability and common intention. He did not give any explanation as to which subsection might apply, how they might be applicable, or the possible status of the accused as a party to the robbery (see pp. 323‐24). In this case, there is no suggestion that the judge failed to explainhowthe definition of a criminal organization related to the offence of participation in the activities of such an organization. [141]In cases of alleged non‐direction, as was discussed at the hearing, the question may come down to the degree of \"obviousness\" of the point of law at issue. While I accept that certain legal requirements are not \"obvious\" or plain from the statutory text — for example,mens rearequirements for various offences — the point of law at issue in the instant case was obvious or plain to the jury, in the context of the entire charge and the trial as a whole. [142]With respect, my colleague's discussion of stereotypical or improper reasoning (at paras. 84‐86 and 92) is also misplaced. First, the issue in this case is not whether structure and continuity serve as safeguards against stereotypical or improper reasoning. It is whether the jury understood structure and continuity to be legal requirements of the offence, based on what the judge did tell the jury. [143]Second, this issue was not discussed in the court below, including by Paciocco J.A. in dissent. The appellant himself states that it \"may have been possible for the jury to infer a continuous group based on a shared neighbourhood, loyalty to one's friends, and the commission of similar crimes — or perhaps even in combination with the shared cultural indicia — but the trial judge was required to adequately equip them to assess this evidence\", which in turn required an instruction on the elements of structure and continuity (A.F., at para. 35). This reinforces that the issue in this case is simply whether the jury understood the legal elements of the definition of a criminal organization, absent the judge's use of the precise words \"structure\" and \"continuity\". [144]Third, Detective Kerr's evidence was not contested by the defence at trial (see A.R., vol. I, at p. 59; A.R., vol. XXXII, at pp. 15 and 20).",

    "text": "I, at p. 59; A.R., vol. XXXII, at pp. 15 and 20). The trial judge related his evidence to photographs of the appellant showing certain indicia of gang membership, as well as to certain behaviours consistent with street gangs (see A.R., vol. I, at pp. 99, 113, 151, 211 and 214). I agree that evidence of a common social or cultural identity does not identify the existence of a criminal organization. But there is a significant difference between this, in a generic sense, and indicia of the appellant's gang membership more specifically, such as displays of the Bloods' hand sign. While the nature of a jury trial necessarily means that the jury's reasons for a guilty verdict are unclear, Detective Kerr's evidence was only part of the evidence put forward by the Crown to prove the existence of a criminal organization. The Crown also relied, crucially, on intercepted wiretap conversations in which the appellant discussed plans to transport firearms on an ongoing basis. [145]Finally, I reiterate and emphasize that an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly — and not necessarily perfectly — instructed (Goforth, at para. 20;Daley, at para. 31;Jacquard, at paras. 2 and 32). InJacquard, Lamer C.J. held that appellate courts must \"ensure that the yardstick by which we measure the fitness of a trial judge's directions to the jury does not become overly onerous\" . He elaborated as follows: We must strive to avoid the proliferation of very lengthy charges in which judges often quote large extracts from appellate decisions simply to safeguard verdicts from appeal. Neither the Crown nor the accused benefits from a confused jury. Indeed justice suffers.",

    "text": "A.The Kabalarian Teaching 3The Kabalarians are a secretive society whose original philosophy seems to have been reduced by the appellant to a hodge-podge of spiritual fantasies (e.g., having sex with disembodied minds). Kabalarians believe that enlightenment is reached through ascension by steps of consciousness. Sexual experience, the appellant says, is a key way to progress to the next level. Perhaps not surprisingly, the appellant preached that he, as the leader, could be instrumental in enabling young girls to reach these higher levels through sexual/spiritual contact with him. The Kabalarian teaching was summarized in part by Donald J.A. in the British Columbia Court of Appeal (citing the appellant's factum), as follows (at para. 18): It is the duty of parents to teach their children to develop their minds. Unbalanced minds continue after the death of a body and can be dangerous to living minds by becoming disembodied minds. A living person who is in a negative state of mind is in danger of drawing from the plane of disembodied minds. A person who is having a sexual problem could attract from the negative sexual plane of mind. That person would then need a session to remove the disembodied mind through a medium. This is referred to as \"mental work\" and could be performed by Mr. Parker [the founder of the Kabalarian philosophy and predecessor to the appellant] and later by [the appellant]. 4Several of the complainants described the appellant's statements in like terms: he talked about relieving them of \"a negative plane of mind\", helping the complainant to become a \"medium\", assisting a complainant's spiritual development to reach a higher plane of mind through him (since he was a \"high spiritual being\"), performing a \"mental demonstration\" (while engaged in physical sexual touching), being close to the \"principle\" (\"universal consciousness\"), developing the complainant into an \"instrument\" and reaching mental oneness through physical oneness. The appellant told some of them during \"mental demonstrations\" that their negative or disembodied plane of mind revealed that they wanted to be raped. 5I should make it clear that the Kabalarian philosophy as such is not and never was on trial. Its relevance to this case is only as background to the distinctive sexual embellishments apparently added by the appellant.",

There was some evidence that these sexual embellishments were not part of Kabalarianism under the leadership of the appellant's predecessor. 6The appellant cautioned his \"pupils\" that they shared a special relationship or bond with him and should not tell anyone else. He suggested to some of the complainants that they were being subjected to sexual intercourse while they slept by the \"minds\" of dead priests. Many of the complainants testified that since the appellant was the spiritual leader of the Kabalarians, they believed at the time that his purpose was spiritual and not for his own sexual gratification. There was shock on the part of some when he used the word \"fuck\" because the Kabalarian philosophy did not permit swearing. One testified that the appellant said his \"sperm was spiritual [and] that it would not make [her] pregnant\".

    "text": "4.Mr. Wigman was charged with three counts of breaking and entering and robbery in an indictment dated October 26, 1981. Count #2 related to an apartment in the City of Vancouver in which Mrs. Margaret Hill resided. Mr. Wigman pleaded guilty to all three charges before Toy J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court. 5.On October 30, 1981, Mr. Wigman was charged with an attempted murder that took place during the break and enter incident cited in Count #2. Hill, a 69 year old woman, lived alone in a ground floor apartment. She went to bed at 8:30 p.m. on May 16, 1981. A neighbour found her lying on the floor of her bedroom the next day at 4:00 p.m. and it was evident that she had suffered very severe injuries. The apartment was \"an awful mess\". A number of items had been taken. The telephone cord had been cut. Medical evidence indicated that she had been struck on the head at least six times and had enormous bruises on other parts of her body. She would likely have died without treatment. The fingerprints of the accused were found in the apartment. 6.The charge was heard by Toy J. and a jury. At the opening of the trial the accused, by his counsel, admitted that he, the accused, gained entry to Mrs. Hill's apartment by removing a sliding door from the apartment balcony, and that he stole various items of jewellery and a sum of money. There was no reference during the trial to Mr. Wigman's prior guilty plea to the break and enter charge. Nor was reference made to theKienappleargument that the accused could not be convicted of both the robbery charge and the attempted murder charge, the violence being common to both. 7.Mr. Wigman's defence to the attempted murder charge was that he had been accompanied by a person called \"Dave\" who had assaulted and severely beaten Mrs. Hill. 8.The judge charged the jury as to the requisite intent for attempted murder as follows: . . . you can go either route, an intention to kill or an intention to cause bodily harm knowing that death may result and being reckless whether death ensues or not. Words giving the jury the choice of two intents were repeated many times in the charge of the jury.",

We would add that it cannot be said with certainty whether the jury found that Mr. Wigman meant to cause death or that he had the lesser and now irrelevant intent, namely, that of meaning to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death or was reckless whether death ensued or not. 11.On December 4, 1981, Toy J. sentenced the appellant to ten years in prison with respect to the charge of breaking and entering and committing robbery, and to life imprisonment with respect to the conviction on the charge of attempted murder.",

Accordingly, all three matters can be briefly summarized as follows. 5InLavallee, the R.C.M.P. obtained a search warrant in the regular form and wording pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Codeon January 16, 1996. The search was to be executed on the following day at the law firm of Lavallee, Rackel & Heintz, in the City of Edmonton, targeting correspondence, estate files, trust records and other documents in relation to Mr. Andy Brent Polo, an individual suspected of money laundering and of being in possession of proceeds of crime. When the R.C.M.P. arrived at the law firm to execute the warrant, a solicitor who was familiar with the documents in question claimed solicitor-client privilege. The searching officers accordingly followed the procedure set out ins. 488.1of theCriminal Code: the documents were sealed in envelopes, summarily identified and taken into police custody. The next day, January 18, 1996, counsel retained by the law firm moved in the Court of Queen's Bench to fix a date and place for a judicial determination of privilege in reference to the seized documents in accordance with s. 488.1(3). In April 1996, the law firm gave notice of a constitutional question, alleging the unconstitutionality ofs. 488.1of theCriminal Code. The law firm and Mr. Polo also moved to quash the warrant but the application was denied in part by Dea J.: (1997), 199 A.R. 21 (Q.B.). In 1998, Veit J. struck down s. 488.1 as unconstitutional: (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Alta. Q.B.). The appeal from that order was dismissed unanimously by the Court of Appeal for Alberta: (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 187. 6InWhite, a search warrant was obtained to search the law offices of Raymond P. Whelan, including all storage facilities occupied by him at the law firm of White, Ottenheimer & Baker, in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland. The warrant authorized officers of Revenue Canada to search the premises for documents relating to Daley Brothers Ltd. and Mr. Terry Daley who were suspected of the offences described ins. 239(1)(a) and (d) of theIncome Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).",

    "text": "29The appellant argues that this Court inMoralesandPearsonemphasized the first two grounds for bail denial, suggesting that other grounds must be seen as suspect. However,Morales,supra, made clear that the grounds for bail denial are not frozen. Indeed, such a suggestion runs counter to common sense and law. Parliament may make any law for bail denial it wishes, provided the law meets the constitutional requirements of theCharter. 30Bail denial to maintain confidence in the administration of justice is not a mere \"catch-all\" for cases where the first two grounds have failed. It represents a separate and distinct basis for bail denial not covered by the other two categories. The same facts may be relevant to all three heads. For example, an accused's implication in a terrorist ring or organized drug trafficking might be relevant to whether he is likely to appear at trial, whether he is likely to commit further offences or interfere with the administration of justice, and whether his detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the justice system. But that does not negate the distinctiveness of the three grounds. 31I conclude that a provision that allows bail to be denied on the basis that the accused's detention is required to maintain confidence in the administration of justice is neither superfluous nor unjustified. It serves a very real need to permit a bail judge to detain an accused pending trial for the purpose of maintaining the public's confidence if the circumstances of the case so warrant. Without public confidence, the bail system and the justice system generally stand compromised. While the circumstances in which recourse to this ground for bail denial may not arise frequently, when they do it is essential that a means of denying bail be available.",

    "text": "4The appellant carried on a business in Edmonton as a paralegal for many years. He was assisted by Helen Lambert. He regularly consulted \"Pops\" Venkatraman, a solicitor, about issues arising in his files, and when advised by \"Pops\" that matters exceeded his competence he would refer his clients to the Venkatraman law firm. The Law Society of Alberta took the view that these referrals did not take place frequently enough, and in October 1994 supplied the Prosecutors' Office in Edmonton with complaints that the appellant was providing legal advice contrary to the AlbertaLegal Profession Act, S.A. 1991, c. L-9.1. The police investigation eventually led to a 92-count indictment against the appellant for a variety of different transactions related to different complainants. 5The conflict of interest largely concerns the activities of one of the Venkatraman firm's associates, Gregory Lazin. Lazin shared office space and some facilities with the law firm in the fall of 1994. The trial judge found that as of January 1, 1995 he should be considered a member of the Venkatraman firm for the purpose of conflict of interest and confidentiality by virtue of the extended definition of \"firm\" adopted by the Law Society of Alberta in itsCode of Professional Conduct(loose-leaf), effective January 1, 1995, at p. ix. I say \"extended meaning\" because the evidence established that Lazin was essentially carrying on an independent practice despite the shared facilities. Effective May 1, 1995, however, Lazin's practice was rolled into the Venkatraman firm, and Lazin himself became an employee. He has since left. 6The trial judge concluded that the lack of legal and factual connections among some of the 92 counts required its severance into five separate indictments. It was agreed that all five indictments would proceed before him and he would, after all the indictments had been dealt with, impose a sentence if convictions were obtained. 7We are concerned here with two of the five indictments. The first trial involved charges that the appellant had fabricated court documents in theDoblankodivorce action. A second group of charges related to an alleged scheme to defraud Canada Trust. The appellant and his business associate, Ms. Helen Lambert, were said to have combined their efforts to obtain from Canada Trust mortgages on behalf of people whose credit worthiness would have been rejected if their identity had been disclosed.",

In one such transaction, for example, a couple called Rambaran wished to buy a property but could not obtain financing by reason of their recent bankruptcy. The allegation was that the appellant went to Canada Trust ostensibly to obtain a mortgage on behalf of Helen Lambert, but in fact on behalf of the bankrupt Rambaran family, with the intention of having the Rambarans assume the mortgage once the monies had been advanced by Canada Trust. Other indictments related in part to allegations of the misappropriation of funds from an estate. 8The conflicts of interest involving the Venkatraman firm came from two sources: (i) With respect to theCanada Trustindictment, the firm acted simultaneously for the appellant in the criminal proceedings and his business associate Helen Lambert in divorce proceedings at a time when they knew, or ought to have known, that she would also be charged in theCanada Trustcriminal proceedings, with an interest adverse to his. Two members of the firm visited the appellant at the Remand Centre on April 18, 1995, including Lazin who arrived late and was there for about 12 minutes during a two-hour interview. At the time he was acting for Helen Lambert. The trial judge concluded that Lazin attended for no purpose except to collect information from the appellant that would be useful to him in his defence of Helen Lambert in the anticipated criminal proceedings. Lazin's plan was to run a \"cut-throat defence\", seeking to paint the appellant as the manipulative criminal and Helen Lambert as an innocent dupe. He was subsequently retained formally as her defence counsel and eventually offered the Crown Attorney's Office a deal under which Lambert would testify against the appellant if the charges against her were dropped. As it was put in cross-examination, \"in return for Lambert sinking [the appellant], Lambert would walk\". None of this, obviously, was in the appellant's interest.",

The appellant was belatedly advised that the Venkatraman law firm would not act for him in theCanada Trustcriminal case because of its involvement with Helen Lambert. (ii) In July 1995, Lazin, still a member of the Venkatraman firm, was approached by Darren Doblanko whose wife had obtained a divorce with the assistance of the appellant some years previously. Quite innocently, she had relied on an affidavit of service on Darren Doblanko (who had earlier deserted her). The affidavit was false. The jury found that the false affidavit of service had been prepared by the appellant. Moreover, the wife had innocently relied on a Certificate of No Appeal containing the forged signature of Doblanko. At the suggestion of the trial judge in theDoblankodivorce, Lazin suggested to Doblanko that he report the forgery to the police. In fact, Lazin steered Doblanko to the same police officer who was responsible for theCanada Trustfile and other cases pending against the appellant. It was suggested by the appellant's counsel that Lazin's strategy was to multiply the allegations of dishonesty against his client to strengthen the credibility of the \"cut-throat\" defence he planned to run on behalf of Helen Lambert in theCanada Trustcase.",

    "text": "(Friesen, at para. 93) [219]It must be remembered that even when child luring is committed in the context of a police operation, it must never be seen \"as a victimless crime\" (Friesen, at para. 94). [220]It is difficult to claim that the conduct of an offender arrested as a result of a sting operation poses no risk of harm. Parliament designed the offence of child luring precisely to prevent such a risk from materializing, that is, to apprehend \"offenders before they can successfully target and harm children\" (Friesen, at para. 94). In this sense, police operations are a key element in the arsenal available to law enforcement agencies to apprehend offenders before it is too late . [221]In short, requiring a high level ofmens reaensures that the offence of child luring captures only conduct that involves a high degree of moral blameworthiness as well as serious harm or a risk of such harm (Friesen, at para. 76). (b)The Effects of the Minimum Term of Imprisonment on the Offenders in the Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical Scenarios Are Not Incompatible With Human Dignity [222]In addition to the scope of the offence, the grossly disproportionate nature of a mandatory minimum sentence is assessed in light of the effects that the penalty may have on the reasonably foreseeable offender (Hills, at para. 133). If these effects entail so much pain and suffering that they undermine human dignity, the impugned provision cannot survive constitutional scrutiny . That is not the case here. [223]For both of the hypothetical offenders, the effects identified by my colleague relate to the treatment they might receive in prison. It seems that imprisonment itself — and not its length — is what plays a major role in her analysis. Although my colleague refrains from concluding that the effects in question, which, I might add, are inherent to incarceration, are such as to undermine human dignity, she nevertheless finds that the first offender's individual circumstances \"would likely make her experience of incarceration perilously grave\" and that, for the second offender, \"[t]he six‐month mandatory minimum in this case is a far cry from the shortest possible rehabilitative sentence\" .",

    "text": "Such reasoning has major implications; its logical consequence is that any minimum term of imprisonment that may be imposed on an offender who has just reached adulthood or on a person with a mental illness will be grossly disproportionate, regardless of the gravity of the offence or the circumstances surrounding its commission. Such an outcome seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the deference owed to Parliament. Indeed, \"if few mandatory minimums can survive the scrutiny exemplified in [my colleague's] reasons on s. 12, then one must question what role is left for Parliament's legitimate policy choices in setting punishment\" (Lloyd, at para. 107, per Wagner J. (as he then was), Gascon and Brown JJ., dissenting). [224]In any event, as explained above, I conclude that a nine‐month term of imprisonment would be fit and appropriate for the offender in the first hypothetical scenario and that a six‐month term of imprisonment is a fit and appropriate punishment in the second hypothetical scenario. In the first case, the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) results in an additional period of imprisonment of three months. In the second case, the application of s. 172.1(2)Cr. C.would therefore result in an additional six months' imprisonment if the offence were prosecuted by indictment. [225]I cannot bring myself to conclude that any additional period of imprisonment has effects that are incompatible with human dignity, because this would amount to indirectly introducing a standard of proportionality. I wish to make one important clarification. My remarks should not be taken to mean that, once incarceration is found to be the fit and appropriate punishment, any additional period of imprisonment is immune from constitutional scrutiny because the offender in question already has to deal with the negative effects associated with imprisonment. In this case, however, there is nothing in the record that allows me to identify \"the precise harm associated\" with this additional period of imprisonment (Hills, at para. 133).",

(c)The Minimum Term of Imprisonment Is Not Grossly Disproportionate to What Is Necessary To Achieve Parliament's Objectives [226]The final stage of the analysis is meant to determine whether the minimum sentence \"goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliament's sentencing objectives relevant to the offence\" (Hills, at para. 138). In this inquiry, courts must consider \"the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives\" . However, it is essential to bear in mind at this stage that gross disproportionality is the constitutional standard that applies in the analysis unders. 12of theCharter. I reiterate this because, in my opinion, my colleague's reasoning transforms the standard of gross disproportionality into one of proportionality. [227]This shift in her analysis can first be seen at para. 158, where she argues that, for offenders whose mental illness contributed to the commission of an offence, \"specific deterrence, general deterrence and denunciation are of little use\". With respect, this argument misses the mark.",

A few years later, they added renting out industrial condominiums to that business, and the rentals are now an important source of income for the respondent Laroche. The building of the condominiums was financed out of substantial investments, the source and legality of which the appellant has questioned. 13In Quebec, for road safety reasons, strict regulations have been put in place and must be complied with when a rebuilt vehicle is put on the road. Under ss. 546.1et seq.of theHighway Safety Code, R.S.Q., c. C‐24.2, a person who wishes to license a rebuilt vehicle must obtain a certificate of technical compliance from the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ). The SAAQ or one of its agents will issue a certificate of compliance only when the rebuilt vehicle has been inspected and meets the manufacturer's standards. 14In the course of an internal audit at Charest Automobile Ltée, which is an agent of the SAAQ, an SAAQ employee found serious irregularities in five rebuilt vehicle files submitted by Garage Côté Laroche Inc. When the invoices and photos in the files were compared, it appeared that the same parts from a damaged vehicle had apparently been used to rebuild more than one vehicle. The employee was convinced that the certificates of technical compliance for the vehicles in question had been obtained illegally, and referred the five fraudulent files to the Victoriaville police. The files involved five Toyota Tacomas which, miraculously, shared some of the same parts. 15After an investigation, the five Toyota Tacomas were seized from their new owners pursuant to a warrant issued under s. 487Cr. C. Investigations by experts from the Sûreté du Québec and the Groupement des assureurs automobiles showed that no major repairs had been done on the allegedly rebuilt vehicles and that the serial numbers on some of the parts had been altered. On May 4, 2000, based on those analyses, the Crown filed charges of forgery, uttering forged documents and possession of stolen property against Laurent Laroche. 16Over the next few months, the police investigation took on dimensions that had been unsuspected at the outset. It covered dozens of rebuilt vehicle files submitted between 1998 and 2000.",

During the period of the investigation, the police obtained a number of search warrants under ss. 487 and 487.01Cr.

An analysis of 142 of those 154 files showed serious irregularities in 98 cases. They included the fact that identical invoices and photographs were found in more than one file, as well as invalid serial numbers. A number of invoices were from businesses either non‐existent or no longer in operation on the billing date. As well, parts that had apparently been purchased in the United States had been invoiced in French, with the G.S.T. and Q.S.T shown on the invoice! 17The scope of the respondents' illegal activities prompted the police to extend their investigation to Laurent Laroche's recent real estate acquisitions. The title searches done regarding Laroche's properties showed that he had apparently purchased immovables valued at about $1,800,000, and that there were no hypothecary charges against them. On those findings being made, a police officer who was an investigator with the city of Victoriaville, Luc Morin, signed an affidavit in support of an application for a restraint order and special warrants of seizure, and the affidavit was submitted to Judge Pinard of the Court of Québec. That application is what led to these proceedings.",

A passenger in one of the cars opened fire and two pedestrians were killed. 3There was very little information available to the police when the investigation first started. On January 26, 1996, Herby Jean‐Charles, who was then incarcerated on a robbery charge, asked to meet with the detective in charge of the investigation into the shooting. He then offered to provide them with information, in exchange for a deal. He told the police officers that the appellant was one of those involved in the double murder. However, the negotiations broke off because Mr. Jean‐Charles' demands were considered to be unrealistic. 4The investigators met with the appellant on several occasions while he was incarcerated at Leclerc Institute to obtain his cooperation. They were met with refusal. During that time, the security classification assigned to the appellant, who was also a suspect in another murder case, was revised upward and he was placed in administrative segregation. On November 6, 1996, the investigators again interviewed Mr. Jean‐Charles, at the Donnacona penitentiary, and entered into an agreement with him under which he was to become a \"special witness\" and participate in recording a conversation with the appellant. A consent to the interception of private communications was signed on that date (ss. 184.1and184.2of theCriminal Code). The appellant was transferred to Donnacona and on November 18, 1996, he had a conversation with Mr. Jean‐Charles which was recorded. 5On September 3, 1997, two first degree murder charges and six attempted murder charges were laid against the appellant. Following avoir direheld between February 26 and March 3, 1998, the judge found the evidence from the interception of the private communication to be admissible: [1998] Q.J. No. 1276 (QL). That communication was the Crown's principal evidence against the appellant. 6The appellant's defence rested primarily on his assertion that he had fabricated the information he related to the informer, Herby Jean‐Charles, on November 18, 1996, which information was tape recorded. He said that he had invented that story after learning from the police and Herby Jean‐Charles that an Emmanuel Zéphyr [translation] \"was out to get [him]\".",

His justification for concocting an incriminating lie was that he hoped to earn the respect of his fellow inmates by saying he had committed the murder, and that this \"notoriety\" might have enabled him to escape any reprisals from Emmanuel Zéphyr. He said that he had put together the details of his lie from details related in the newspapers, from his imagination and from information provided to him by third parties. 7On March 11, 1998, at the very end of the trial, the appellant repeatedly refused to answer questions concerning the identity of the third parties who had allegedly provided him with information about the crime. The reason given by the appellant was that answering those questions could put his life and the lives of his family members in danger. 8The proceeding out of which the appeal arises took place as follows.

You say that you received confidences concerning this shooting? A Yes, that's correct. Q It's correct that you received confidences. Can you tell us, first, in what circumstances you received those confidences? A No particularly special circumstances, just in talking. Q Fine. We are going to get you to give us a few more details. \"No particularly special circumstances\", fine. Let's start with the place, for example, where those confidences took place. A In an apartment.

The fee for a locker is $2 for any period of 24 hours or less, with a $4 overtime charge for an additional 24 hours. After the period expires, the contents of the locker may be removed and held for 30 days, after which they can be sold for accrued charges. A sticker on each locker explains these terms and conditions. The lockers are owned by Canadian Locker Company and are managed on an alternating basis by Greyhound Bus Lines and Grey Goose Bus Lines. 3On March 14, 1998, two individuals approached the security desk at the Winnipeg bus depot to inquire about the use of lockers there. While one of the individuals spoke to the security guards, the other went to the bank of lockers and removed a bag from locker 135. He was noticed digging through the bag, and one of the security guards noted a slight odour of marijuana. The second man was pacing in front of the security guards and was glancing around. The two individuals were then seen locking the locker and walking out of the bus depot. 4Approximately one hour and 45 minutes later, after completing other duties, the security guards decided to investigate further. They went to the locker. One of the guards, Mr. Mah, sniffed the vent of the locker door and smelled a strong odour of marijuana. The security guards went to the Cargo Express Agent for Greyhound Bus Lines, Mr. Will, and advised him of what they suspected was in the locker and inquired whether they could gain access. Mr. Will opened the locker with his master key. One of the security guards removed the duffel bag that they had seen being placed in the locker earlier and opened it. Inside, they found a sleeping bag with a quantity of marijuana rolled up in the middle. Following this discovery, the security guards placed the items back in the locker, locked it, and contacted the Winnipeg Police Service. 5A short time later, Constables Barker and Riddell attended the bus depot and were directed by the security guards to locker 135.

They had been together about three months. The offence occurred in the morning, but the [respondent] stated he did not remember too much. He remembered having been paranoid for some weeks prior to the offence and that he had this song in his head. He cannot remember what the song said.

The respondent was reported to have stated, \"[i]t was either the door or Brad's jaw, man, I had to hit something\". Subsequently, in January 1990, while living in the community, the respondent severely fractured a man's jaw with a pool cue during a disagreement while under the influence of alcohol. The respondent was convicted of assault causing bodily harm on June 7, 1990, and sentenced to 14 months in prison. 7Thereafter, efforts were again made to release the respondent gradually into the community, but the problems with substance abuse re-occurred, and he continued to show some propensity towards violence. In 1991, for example, the respondent was admitted to the KPH's secure unit. While there, he engaged in what were called \"assaultive behaviours\" while under the influence of alcohol. A 1992 risk assessment conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Health placed the respondent in a category of violent offenders for which it was predicted that 44 per cent would re-offend violently within seven years after release. A 1992 KPH report signed by the hospital medical staff noted that the respondent's risk assessment included abuse of street drugs and/or alcohol, and violence against other persons: [The respondent's] prognosis continued to be extremely guarded given his lack of insight into his situation, his lack of regard for other persons, and his intolerance of the system. It was predicted that a circumstantial situation will likely compromise his liberty at an early stage in community living.

[82]In the following subsection, I will explain why the evidence of the other witnesses about the accused's violence towards the complainant, while certainly discreditable to the accused, was covered by the indictment and could not, in this case, be characterized as evidence of past discreditable conduct. (c)Regular Violence and Threats of Violence by the Accused Were Covered by the Indictment [83]The Crown filed a two-count indictment. Since the two counts are linked, and the trial judge acquitted the accused on the second count based on the same reasons he acquitted the accused on the first count, my reasons will focus exclusively on the trafficking in persons count: [T]hat he between the 1stday of November, 2006 and the 31stday of December, 2011, at and near Fort Saskatchewan and Edmonton, Alberta, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, did unlawfully recruit, exercise control or direction or influence over the movements of [the complainant], for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation, contrary to Section 279.01(1) of theCriminal Code. (A.R., vol. I, at p. 5) [84]The time period spans over five years between November 1, 2006, when the accused and the complainant first moved to Fort Saskatchewan (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 197-98 and 202), and December 31, 2011, not long before they separated.",

During that time period, the accused and the complainant moved from Fort Saskatchewan to Edmonton and then back to Halifax, all of which are covered by the indictment (trial reasons, at paras. 4, 7 and 10). [85]The trial judge could not ignore that the regular violence and threats of violence as provided in the evidence by the other witnesses took place within the specified time period, at the specified locations, and was directed towards the complainant. [86]The trial judge did not conclude that the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant fell outside the factual parameters of the indictment. Rather, he held, as a matter of law, that the regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was not an element of theactus reusof the trafficking in persons offence, nor the definition of exploitation. This is why it \"fell to\" the complainant to provide that evidence. [87]This interpretation finds support in para. 45 of the trial judge's reasons: Given that the . . . prior witnesses could not provide direct evidence of the elements of these offences, it fell to [the complainant] to provide that testimony. Consequently, her credibility comes into play. [88]Read in isolation, this sentence reveals an error of law. Evidence can be direct or circumstantial, and both types of evidence can satisfy a judge beyond reasonable doubt that a fact in issue is true (D. Watt,Watt's Manual of Criminal Evidence(2024), at §§ 1:17-1:18). Read contextually, this sentence reflects the trial judge's concern that the evidence of the other witnesses on the accused's violence did not \"directly address\" (paras. 42 and 57), or \"directly support\" the charges. [89]At trial, although the accused never argued that the other witnesses' evidence was past discreditable conduct evidence, he argued that very little evidence related to the actual substance of the allegation, and referred to evidence of the accused's violence as evidence of surrounding circumstances evidence that only \"takes you so far\" (A.R., vol. III, at p. 405).",

Later in oral submissions, defence counsel argued that the complainant was \"the only one who can speak to several of the essential elements in terms of the control and the alleged forcing into the sex trade\", and who can tell the trial judge that the accused exploited her (p. 431; see also pp. 406 and 432). [90]The trial judge's conclusion thus rejects the Crown's theory of the case, which sought to establish that the accused had controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant \"through the overwhelming evidence that [the complainant] was in a relationship that was physically and psychologically abusive and controlling\" (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 393-94). (d)Regular Violence and Threats of Violence by an Accused Can Be Relevant and Material to the Actus Reus [91]Regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim and, more generally, their violent relationship, can amount to exercising control, direction, or influence over their movements during a period of time, provided that the effect of that violence is that the victim's movements have been effectively controlled, directed, or influenced during that time. Violence is also relevant and material to the definition of exploitation, as this definition is met when the accused engages in any conduct, including regular violence and threats of violence, that both causes the victim to provide (or offer to provide) labour or a service, and could be reasonably expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety (or the safety of a person known to them) would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service.",

Condoms were used on occasion; however, the complainant did not take the usual precautions against pregnancy because the respondent had told her that he had had a vasectomy. 4The relationship began in June 1991. The Agreed Statement of Facts says that \"soon after\", the sexual activity began. Unfortunately, there is no evidence about precisely when the first act of intercourse occurred, or the approximate frequency of sexual intercourse over the ensuing 18-month period. 5Unknown to the complainant, the respondent attended a medical clinic in St. John's for HIV testing on October 16, 1991. It seems his name was on a list of former partners provided by an individual who had tested HIV-positive, that is to say, was shown to be infected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. He was told on November 15, 1991 that he too had tested HIV-positive. He was given counselling on at least three different occasions by two doctors and a nurse about HIV, its transmission, safer practices and his duty to disclose his HIV status to sexual partners. The respondent says he was devastated by the result of the test, but chose to follow none of the recommended safer practices in his relationship with the complainant, whom he kept in the dark about his HIV condition. He provided the names of two past sexual partners to the public health authorities, but not the name of the complainant. In fact, as stated, the complainant did not know the respondent had been tested. 6The complainant took an HIV test on November 20, 1991. We do not know who or what prompted this action. She tested negative for the virus and so informed the respondent. Their sexual relationship continued for another year, terminating for unrelated reasons in November 1992. 7In the spring of 1994, the complainant attended a program calledSkills for Success. A guest speaker spoke on the subject of HIV and AIDS. The complainant became concerned because she was displaying some of the symptoms of HIV infection that were mentioned by the guest lecturer. This prompted her to get a second test done.",

The indictment stemmed from incidents that took place in Hinton, Alberta, around July of 1996. A few months following the alleged sexual assault, the young complainant discovered that she was pregnant at which point she advised her mother that the appellant, S.A.B., who had been living with the complainant's family for several months, had sexually assaulted her. The complainant had an abortion and the police seized the fetal tissue for DNA testing. 23Pursuant to anex partewarrant authorizing the seizure of a blood sample under ss. 487.04 to 487.09, the police seized a blood sample from the appellant and conducted DNA analysis. Typically, forensic DNA analysis will compare two samples of DNA to determine if they match. In this case, the forensic DNA analysis compared the appellant's blood sample with the fetal tissue (the combined DNA of the complainant and the accused) taken from within the complainant's body in order to confirm or deny that the appellant had fathered the fetus. Essentially, a paternity test was conducted with the appellant's DNA. Such use of the DNA is contemplated by the legislation per s. 487.05(1)(b)(ii). The appellant was arrested and charged with sexual assault. At trial, the appellant sought a declaration that the DNA warrant provisions in ss. 487.04 to 487.09 violatess. 7and8of theCharter. 24During the trial, evidence was presented that five of the seven DNA samples taken from the appellant were conclusive and established the probability that S.A.B. was not the father of the fetus to be 1 in 10 million. The sixth test sample was damaged and yielded inconclusive results. The seventh sample did not match the appellant's DNA. This non‐matching sample was determined by the Crown DNA expert to be a mutation and was therefore disregarded. The DNA expert, Dr. Szakacs, testified that \"mutations are well documented in paternity testing, and the international guidelines state that at least two exclusions have to be noted before parental exclusion can be determined\". No evidence was given as to the nature of the international guidelines referred to. If the non-matching sample was not a mutation, there would be no possibility that the accused was the father of the fetus.",

Schmidt took the child with her to New York State, where she kept her for almost two years, raising her as her daughter. In the interim, the child's father committed suicide, allegedly as a result of his inability to discover his child's whereabouts. 3.On March 22, 1982, Schmidt attended a family reunion in Buffalo, New York, accompanied by Denise. Another son of hers, Donald Gress, was also at the reunion. By sheer coincidence, Donald Gress not only came from Cleveland but knew the child's parents and had helped to search for her after her abduction. Following the reunion, he told Cleveland police of Denise's whereabouts and she was returned to her mother on March 26, 1982. 4.Following her arrest, Schmidt was charged with the federal offence of kidnapping and the state offence of child‐stealing. Grand juries returned indictments on both charges, on March 29, 1982 on the state charge and on March 31, 1982 on the federal charge. 5.The two charges have some similarities but they also have important differences. The federal offence under theUnited States Code, Title 18 reads: §1201. Kidnapping (a) Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person, except in the case of a minor by the parent thereof, when: (1) the person is willfully transported in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) any such act against the person is done within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States; (3) any such act against the person is done within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section 101(36) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1301(36)); or (4) the person is a foreign official, an internationally protected person, or an official guest as those terms are defined in section 1116(b) of this title, shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.",

(B) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the actor reasonably believed that his conduct was necessary to preserve the child's health or welfare. 6.On July 26, 1982, Schmidt was tried on the federal charge by a judge and jury. She admitted the abduction, but contended that she had taken part in it in the belief that Denise was the illegitimate daughter of her son Donald Gress, and that she had been abandoned by her father and was living with her natural mother \"in a home of ill repute\". On July 30, 1982, the jury found Schmidt not guilty and she was acquitted. 7.On August 6, 1982, while the state offence of child‐stealing was still pending, Schmidt, who is a Canadian citizen, left the United States and came to Canada. She was arrested in Kirkland Lake, Ontario on August 30, 1982 and extradition proceedings against her were begun pursuant to the Canada‐United States extradition treaty. 8.I should add that Schmidt's counsel argues that if Schmidt is returned to Ohio, she will not have the benefit of raising her previous federal prosecution in bar of her prosecution under state law. While under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, a person is protected from double jeopardy against federal prosecutions, that provision does not apply to the states although at some point the cruelty of harassment by multiple prosecutions by a state would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: seeBartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959). It is clear, however, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not automatically protect an individual from being prosecuted under a state law although the accused was earlier tried and acquitted of an offence under federal law. Thus inBartkus v. Illinois,supra, the accused was tried and acquitted under a federal law of robbing a federally insured bank. He was later tried and convicted on substantially the same evidence in an Illinois state court for violating an Illinois robbery statute.",

A warrant for his arrest was then issued by the appellant Republic of Argentina on June 27, 1977. 4.In 1979, Mellino was arrested in Uruguay and extradition proceedings were begun against him. However Argentina was unable to supply the necessary documentation within the time stipulated in its extradition treaty with Uruguay, and Mellino was accordingly released after two to three weeks' imprisonment. 5.Mellino later made his way to the United States and eventually entered Canada in the Fall of 1982. On November 22, 1982, he was arrested in Calgary under theImmigration Act. Two days later, on November 24, 1982, a warrant for his apprehension was issued under theExtradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‐21, and he was arrested on November 30. On December 6, 1982, Mellino was ordered to be held in custody until his extradition hearing, which was set for February 14, 1983. However, he was set free on February 1, 1983. By that time, two months had elapsed from the time of his apprehension, a period that brought into play article XIV of the extradition treaty between Canada and Argentina, which provides for a fugitive's release unless sufficient evidence is produced within that time to warrant his committal for surrender; seeStatutes of Canada, 1894, p. xlii, at p. xlvii. Article XIV also makes provision for an extension of time but an application for this purpose by the Government of Canada to Brennan J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta was dismissed and Mellino was set free. 6.Mellino then applied for convention refugee status under theImmigration Act, and was granted that status on December 1, 1983. However, from some time during the Spring of 1983 up to the first half of 1984, meetings were held between officials of the Department of Justice of Canada and of Argentina regarding the preparation of evidence in a form admissible in a Canadian extradition hearing. 7.On June 19, 1984, Argentina made a second request for extradition.

On December 11, 1984, Waite J. found that Mellino's right unders. 11(b)of theCharterhad been infringed or denied, and pursuant tos. 24(1)of theCharterdismissed the application for extradition and discharged Mellino.

He was found outside an apartment building, collapsed, shivering, with broken bones and with other severe injuries to his head and legs. He had no wallet, no house keys and no identification. 13Barnaby told a uniformed officer, with whom he spoke briefly soon after the attack, that he had been beaten over a gold chain. 14Detective Sean Lawson, initially assigned to the case, stated in his \"Occurrence Report\" that the attack was believed to be over a drug debt and the victim was being less than truthful. His suspicion in this regard was based on a conversation with Barnaby at the hospital, on the ferocity of the beating, on the fact that Barnaby had a drug-related conviction, and on other elements of Detective Lawson's own preliminary investigation. 15On the following morning, referring to the Barnaby attack in his \"Daily Major\" report summarizing all serious crimes that had occurred during his shift, Detective-Sergeant Ian Ganson wrote: \"believed to be [over] a drug debt [. . .] further inquiries\". Ganson, it should be noted, never spoke directly with Barnaby. He merely relied, in the usual way, on information he had received from subordinate investigators and uniformed officers. 16Lawson's \"Occurrence Report\" and Ganson's \"Daily Major\" report were disclosed to the defence in a timely manner, as required by law.

Unlike Lawson and Ganson, Korb and Ottaway believed Barnaby's version of the assault and the reasons for it. 18Barnaby, at a photographic line-up, identified the appellant as the unmasked attacker.",

    "text": "3In December 1997, the Quebec City police conducted an investigation of second-hand store owners suspected of selling stolen merchandise. As part of the investigation, investigators Tremblay and Gagné were ordered to set up an operation using an undercover officer codenamed \"Agent 008\" who would offer merchandise he claimed to be stolen to selected merchants. 4The respondent Claude Daoust owns three pawn shop/second-hand stores, including Argent Comptant, a business located in Quebec City. The respondent Éric Bois is the manager of this establishment. Between December 2 and 5, 1997, the undercover officer went to Argent Comptant on four different occasions to offer merchandise to the respondents Daoust and Bois. The undercover officer would hint he had criminally obtained goods to sell. Disguised so as to give the impression he was a financially disadvantaged person, he approached the respondents on four occasions, offering to sell them two new video cassette recorders, a slightly used video cassette recorder, two new telephones and a new alarm clock. He received a total of $60 for the goods. 5As none of the merchandise offered and sold by the undercover officer was actually stolen, but had instead come from a merchant who had agreed to lend the goods to the police for the purposes of their investigation, the objective of the operation was to establish if the respondents were laundering merchandise as part of their normal commercial activities while believing, if not knowing for certain, that the goods were stolen. The undercover officer was supposed to offer the merchandise while mentioning that it was \"hot\" or indicating as much in similar terms such that there could be no doubt that the goods were illegally obtained. 6According to the officer's notes, the first \"sale\", that of a used Sony video cassette recorder with remote control, unfolded as follows: [translation] – Daoust: \"Does it work?\" (referring to the video equipment). – 008: \"I don't know. It's not mine. It's hot. I have to unload it.\" – Daoust: (staring closely at the undercover officer and smiling faintly) \"You got any I.D.?\" – 008: \"Yeah, but don't call the police. I don't want any trouble, O.K.?\" – Daoust: \"Well, I can't give you $50 for stuff like that. I'll give you $20 if it works.\" – 008: \"Come on. Give me at least $30.",

I need the money.\" – Daoust: \"If it's stolen, $20 and not a penny more.\" 7Similar meetings leading to sales occurred over the next three days. The last transaction, one involving a new Sony video cassette recorder, ended with the merchandise being accepted for $5. At that time, the respondent Daoust told the undercover officer that this was the last time they would do business together, to which the respondent Bois added, [translation] \"We can't always be helping you to steal.\" 8In accordance with Quebec City municipal by-law 755, which requires that all transactions be recorded in a register, the transactions between the undercover officer and the respondents were entered in the shop's computer. However, the copy of the contract normally given to the client was deliberately torn up, while the respondents kept the originals in their files. 9Shortly after the final transaction, that is, during the afternoon of December 5, 1997, police officers went to the shop and executed a search warrant to recover the goods from the previous transactions. In two separate cases, the respondents were charged under ss. 141 and 462.31(1)(a)Cr. C.with compounding an indictable offence and laundering proceeds of crime. The evidence presented at the respondent Daoust's trial, including his testimony, was introduced with consent at the trial of the respondent Bois, who chose not to testify.",

    "text": "5The victim, a young Newfoundlander named Jerome Fleming, was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest at short range. His body was found in the woods near Bay Bulls. Smith was seen with the victim a few hours before the likely time of death. They had been drinking together. The victim was not again seen alive. There was circumstantial evidence that linked Smith to the shotgun that was used in the killing. There was some suggestion in the evidence that a drug deal had gone bad. The prosecution's case depended largely on inculpatory statements made to the investigating RCMP officer over a five-day period, and a \"confession\" to a jail house informant. 6There is no doubt that Smith's alleged statements to the RCMP officer, if accepted at face value, were inculpatory. At one point, he is alleged to have said to the police interrogator, \"[T]here is no explanation for dumping your best buddy in the woods\" (appellant's record, at p. 113). Later, Smith was asked by the police officer if the shotgun used in the killing was still available, to which he replied, \"[N]o, the gun is not available.\" He then added that what hemeantto say was thatifhe had done it, then the gunwouldnot be available. 7When a police officer suggested that perhaps Fleming's death was accidental, Smith said that he would see if his lawyer could work out a \"deal\". If so, he would talk to the police and, if not, he would take his chances on a murder charge. 8As mentioned, Smith was convicted and properly filed a notice of appeal. However, and despite his efforts, the appeal remained pending until his death. The Crown moved to have it abated some seven years later. Counsel retained by Smith shortly before his death was then appointed by the court to represent the interests of the \"Smith family\". There was no formal substitution of a live appellant for the deceased. (This is an irregularity to be addressed below.) Counsel's argument is that the members of Smith's family still bear the emotional, social and psychological scars of the murder conviction. They have made every effort to carry on the struggle to clear the family name since his death.",

    "text": "4The appellant has displayed symptoms of chronic schizophrenia since at least 1986 and has been hospitalized on numerous occasions as a result of his illness. His mental disorder has been linked to a lengthy criminal record which includes convictions for theft, mischief, failing to appear and breach of probation. In 1987, he was convicted of sexual assault. 5On March 11, 1991, at a rooming house for persons with mental disorders, he stabbed a male staff-worker under the delusional belief that this worker had both beaten and raped him and was about to strangle his mother. He feared he was about to be strangled. The appellant was charged with assault with a weapon. He was found not criminally responsible (\"NCR\") on account of mental disorder. 6On August 13, 1991, he was committed to the Kingston Psychiatric Hospital, amediumsecurity facility. On January 19, 1993, the Ontario Review Board ordered his transfer to amaximumsecurity facility (the Oak Ridge Division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre). The appellant submits that his earlier transfer occurred so that he could take part in recreational activities at Oak Ridge and improve the quality of his life. The Crown submits he was transferred because he posed \"a serious management problem\" at the medium security hospital where he refused treatment and behaved inappropriately. For the purpose of this appeal, we need not decide why he was transferred in 1993. 7At Oak Ridge, the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from substance abuse and chronic paranoid schizophrenia, a personality disorder with anti-social traits. He was last \"physically assaultive\" in 1996. In January 1998, he experienced a \"significant episode of behavioural dysfunction\". The appellant also engaged in \"sexually inappropriate behaviour\". The most recent such episode was in 1998. 8According to nursing notes dated May 24, 2000, the appellant said that voices from a television set had told him to stop taking his medication, and that his brother had been calling and wanted him out of Oak Ridge. The appellant requires drugs to control his mental disorder. He objects to taking the medication, however, and it is administered by substitute consent provided by his father. In the 12 months prior to the most recent Board Disposition, the appellant had developed a problem with \"water intoxication\". The hospital Administrator recommended his continued detention at Oak Ridge maximum security institution.",

On December 9, 1976, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was placed under a warrant of the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories. He was then transferred to the maximum security Oak Ridge Division of the Mental Health Centre in Penetanguishene, Ontario. He has been detained in mental hospitals for the past 27 years. 7The appellant, who is now 50 years old, has been diagnosed as having a mixed personality disorder with characteristics of anti-social, borderline and narcissistic traits, possibly sadistic paraphilia, and a history of drug and alcohol abuse. 8On January 30, 1984, he was transferred to a medium security facility at the St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital in St. Thomas, Ontario. While there, he had a sexual relationship with a member of the staff. When the relationship ended, the appellant's mental stability deteriorated. He was depressed, and suicidal. There was evidence that he contemplated taking hostages. On October 2, 1985, the appellant was returned to the maximum security facility at Oak Ridge. 9In 1995, the appellant requested to be transferred to a medium security facility. Over the objections of St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital, he was returned to that facility by Review Board order dated June 23, 1995. The hospital believes that the appellant's subsequent conduct justified its opposition to his 1995 transfer. On June 30, 2000, on the recommendation of St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital, a differently constituted panel of the Review Board ordered that the appellant be sent back to the maximum security unit of the Oak Ridge Division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre. The appropriateness of that disposition is at issue in this appeal.",

On February 10, 1999, he received a call from Jules Renaud, a disgruntled former employee, who said, [translation] \"We're coming to get you, pigs.\" 22Two days later, Robert Dompierre, the victim, appeared at the garage and told Benoît Randall, who worked there with Fontaine, that someone had tried to hire him to murder both Randall and Fontaine. He told Randall as well that there was [translation] \"a contract out on their heads\". Randall later that day shared this information with Fontaine. 23On February 14, 1999, Fontaine and his girlfriend, Diane Boulé, went to a meeting. Fontaine and Boulé testified that four men were watching him there and two of them followed him into the washroom, where he had gone to smoke marijuana. 24Upon leaving the meeting, Fontaine used his remote starter lest an explosive device had been installed in his car. Fontaine then advised Randall that he had been followed. Together, they purchased a firearm. 25That same evening, Fontaine saw Renaud lurking outside his home. He called Randall, who came by but noticed nothing unusual. During the night, Fontaine again smoked marijuana. At around four o'clock in the morning, he thought he heard someone breaking into his home. He fired his gun at the doors and windows and into the walls. Fontaine later told his girlfriend and Randall that he thought he had shot some nocturnal intruders. 26Later that morning, Dompierre came to the garage to pay a debt he owed the proprietor. Seeing Dompierre approach, Fontaine grabbed his gun and shot Dompierre twice. Dompierre attempted to flee. Fontaine followed him outside, fired five more shots in his direction and wounded him fatally. 27Fontaine fled the scene but later turned himself in to the police. 28During his interrogation, Fontaine claimed that he had shot Dompierre to prevent Dompierre from carrying out the \"contract on his [Fontaine's] head\". 29At trial, Fontaine's defence was mental disorder automatism. He testified that he had acted involuntarily and related in detail the circumstances that gave rise to his state of mind at the time of the offence. He explained that he had \"frozen\" and had only a partial recollection of the facts concerning the murder of Dompierre. 30Several psychiatric experts also gave evidence.",

Dr. Richard Laliberté testified that Fontaine had smoked marijuana excessively during the weeks leading up to the murder. According to Dr. Laliberté, certain aspects of Fontaine's story were indicative of paranoid delusions, though it was difficult to determine with certainty whether Fontaine's story was real or delusional. 31Dr. Bruno Laplante, another psychiatrist, testified that Fontaine suffered from a chronic antisocial personality disorder and acute paranoid delusions, but did not fall withins. 16of theCriminal Code. 32Dr. Jacques Talbot, also a psychiatrist, was the main defence expert. He presented two reports. In the first, he concluded that Fontaine had a psychological condition characterized by delusions. These could be triggered by a chemical substance, including marijuana. Dr. Talbot found that it was difficult to determine to what extent Fontaine's belief that his life was in danger was fact-driven and to what extent it was delusional. 33In his second report, which he adopted in his testimony, Dr. Talbot stated that Fontaine, at the time of the shooting, was in a psychotic state triggered by substance abuse. This episode, according to Dr. Talbot, had begun several days earlier and ended several days afterward. Dr. Talbot concluded that a major psychological problem had so affected Fontaine's judgment that he was unable to differentiate right from wrong. 34Finally, Dr. Sylvain Faucher, yet another psychiatrist, testified for the Crown, in reply, that Fontaine was not psychotic at the time of the murder and was not psychotic at any time in 1999.",

An explosion caused the deaths of two baggage handlers and injured four others at the Narita Airport in Japan. A second explosion caused Air India Flight 182 to crash off the west coast of Ireland, causing the death of all 329 passengers and crew. 6On February 4, 1988, the first accused, Inderjit Singh Reyat, was arrested in England where he was living with his family. Mr. Reyat was extradited to Canada on December 13, 1989, to face a number of charges relating to the explosion at Narita Airport. On May 10, 1991, he was convicted on seven counts:R. v. Reyat, [1991] B.C.J. No. 2006 (QL) (S.C.). 7On October 27, 2000, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri were jointly charged with respect to both explosions and the intended explosion of Air India Flight 301. A few months later, on March 8, 2001, a direct indictment was filed against the accused, Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri, and on June 5, 2001, a new indictment was filed, adding a third accused, Mr. Reyat. Mr. Reyat plead guilty on February 10, 2003, to a new indictment that charged him with aiding or abetting the construction of the explosive device that was placed on Air India Flight 182. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment in addition to the time already spent in custody. 8Following Mr. Reyat's guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter in February 2003, Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri re-elected, before Josephson J. of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, to be tried by a judge alone. The trial of Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri (the \"Air India Trial\") commenced on April 28, 2003 and continues to this date. 9On May 6, 2003, the Crown applied to a judgeex partefor a s. 83.28 order to gather information regarding the Air India offences from the Named Person.

Garon was a member of the Indian Posse, a gang which exerted control over the other inmates — and the institution at large — through intimidation and assault. 4Kerr worked at the institution as servery cleaner. On the evening of January 15, 2000, Garon demanded coffee from Kerr, but Kerr refused to provide it. Garon told Kerr that if he were not provided with coffee, the prison guard would later find Kerr with his head smashed in. Later, another inmate, also a member of the Indian Posse, similarly demanded coffee and told Kerr that if he were not provided with coffee, Kerr should not be around the next day. 5The following morning, Kerr, as part of his duties as servery cleaner, set up the dining area for breakfast. Anticipating an attack, he retrieved two weapons which he had hidden under a sink — a metal knife which he had manufactured by sharpening a big spoon, and an ice pick which he had manufactured by sharpening a steel rod. He concealed the weapons in his pants, and remained vigilant as various prisoners entered the dining area. 6Garon, as well as other members of the Indian Posse, entered the dining area. Garon told Kerr that he had \"punked him off\"; Kerr replied \"whatever\". The door to the dining area was then closed, and Garon approached Kerr, brandishing a homemade knife. Kerr then retrieved his own metal knife. A physical altercation ensued, during which each stabbed the other multiple times. At some point, Garon jumped back and shrugged as though the fight were over. He began to walk out of the dining area, but collapsed. 7Garon was transported to the Royal Alexandra Hospital and pronounced dead later that morning. He died of a stab wound to the head delivered by Kerr during the altercation. Kerr was charged on July 9, 2001 with the second degree murder of Garon, contrary tos. 235(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and with possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88(1) of theCode.",

    "text": "(i)Introductory 4Having met as students at the University of Iowa, Colin Thatcher and his former wife JoAnn were married on August 12, 1962. After their marriage, they returned to Saskatchewan. They took up residence in Moose Jaw. Mr. Thatcher, the son of a one‐time member of Parliament and Premier of Saskatchewan, developed over the years an active and successful career as rancher, farmer and politician, serving for a time as Minister of Energy and Mines in a Progressive Conservative Government of Saskatchewan. Three children, Greg, Regan and Stephanie, were born of the marriage. Thatcher admitted to infidelity during the course of the marriage. The couple separated in August 1979. JoAnn, taking the two youngest children with her, left Moose Jaw with Mr. Thatcher's best friend, Ron Graham. Relations between the estranged spouses became increasingly bitter and acrimonious as they fought a long, hotly contested series of custody, access and matrimonial property battles. Colin Thatcher became obsessed. At one juncture he spirited Regan out of the country, and was found in contempt and ordered to pay a substantial fine. JoAnn's matrimonial property entitlement was initially held to amount to $820,000 but the judgment was immediately appealed. In 1980, the Thatchers were divorced. In January 1981, JoAnn married Mr. Tony Wilson and moved into a house located across the street from the Legislative Buildings in Regina. (ii)The Spring of 1981 5On the evening of Sunday, May 17, 1981 JoAnn Wilson was shot and wounded while in the kitchen of her home. A bullet fired from a high‐powered rifle passed through a triple glaze glass window and struck her in the shoulder. She was hospitalized for about three weeks. The evidence was that JoAnn Wilson was terrified by this attempt on her life. After the shooting, she gave up her right to custody of Regan and, a year later, agreed to accept approximately one half of the original court award, spread over five years. No one was charged with the May 17, 1981 incident. (iii)January 21, 1983 6At about 6 o'clock in the evening of January 21, 1983, JoAnn Wilson came home, drove into the garage of her home and was ferociously beaten and then shot to death. Twenty‐seven wounds were inflicted on her head, neck, hands and lower legs.",

A single bullet entered her skull causing death. 7Mr. Craig Dotson testified as to the finding of the body. He stated that he left work at the Legislative Buildings shortly before 6:00 p.m. on January 21, 1983, and was walking home when he noted a green car with a female driver turn into the garage at the Wilson residence. He continued walking for about a block. He heard loud shrill screams behind him. He turned back to investigate. He heard a single loud sharp noise and then silence. As he approached a lane near the Wilson garage he saw a man emerge from the garage. He did not pay any particular attention. It was dark. He was 30 to 40 feet from the individual. He walked a little further and saw a body in a pool of blood on the floor of the garage. 8Mr. Dotson told the police he thought the man he momentarily observed had a beard, was about thirty years old, five foot nine to five foot eleven in height, and of medium build. A composite sketch prepared by the police with Mr. Dotson's aid did not fit Colin Thatcher, whom Mr. Dotson knew as a member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly.",

    "text": "2On May 24, 2000, the respondent, a member of the Ontario Provincial Police, attended an elementary school with another police officer, Constable Renauld. Both officers were in uniform and on duty. The respondent's wife had arrived earlier to search for a knife that she believed was in their son's possession. Her actions were prompted by the alarming notes she found at home written by him. She called the respondent from the school. There were allegations that their son had shown a knife to other students and made threats. The knife was found in a box in another student's desk and given to Guy Campeau, a teacher, who decided that the police should be contacted. 3The respondent met with his wife, their son and Mr. Campeau, in the principal's office. Constable Renauld remained in the outer office with the secretary. The respondent told Mr. Campeau that the knife had been recently bought at a flea market for whittling wood and that he had warned his son not to take it to school. Mr. Campeau suggested that the respondent's son be sent home and that the principal, David Parks, who was away that day, would decide the length of the suspension. 4Given the seriousness of the situation, Mr. Campeau asked the respondent about the procedure for laying criminal charges. The respondent told him that it was the responsibility of the police. He also asked the respondent whether he was there as a father or police officer, and the respondent replied that he was there as a concerned father and as a police officer. Mr. Campeau decided that as a police officer, the respondent should have the knife in order to conduct the investigation, and gave it to him. The respondent, accompanied by Constable Renauld, then drove his wife and son home. 5On May 25, 2000, Mr. Parks, the principal, dissatisfied with how the matter had been handled the previous day, contacted the police and requested that another officer investigate the incident. Detective Sergeant Lalonde was assigned to the case and when he spoke to the respondent that night, he asked him what sort of knife was involved. The respondent replied that it was a small jackknife. Mr. Campeau had looked at the knife in the box after removing the lid but never touched it.",

The respondent never complied with a subsequent request to turn the knife over to the police. 7On June 22, 2000, the respondent was charged with twoCriminal Codeoffences: possession of a prohibited weapon contrary to s. 91(2) and obstruction of justice contrary to s. 139(2).",

At the time of the alleged offences, the age of consent was 14. 3The respondent, a medical doctor, was an assistant coach of the complainant's basketball team. The complainant alleged that his relationship with the respondent began when he was 13 years old. He claimed that the respondent paid more attention to him than others, picked him up at school sometimes, took him out to lunch, gave him some money and eventually asked him if he wanted to come to his house and rake leaves. When the complainant arrived, the respondent gave him a tour of the house and the first of two incidents of sexual contact allegedly occurred. 4Both alleged incidents, which happened several weeks apart, involved disrobing, kissing on the lips, the respondent rubbing the complainant's genital area, straddling the complainant's chest and inserting his penis into the complainant's mouth. The second incident also involved the use of ropes to tie the complainant's wrists to the bed post and ejaculation by the respondent. 5At the preliminary inquiry, after the complainant had described the first incident involving the respondent pushing his penis in and out of his mouth, Crown counsel asked: Is this something that you wanted to be doing? No. 6After the complainant described the second incident, Crown counsel asked: Did you want to be engaging in that kind of activity on that day? No. I think that – I think that I really wanted to spend time with him, but not doing that. Why was it that you wanted to spend time with him? Because he had patience for me and he was very kind and understanding and I just felt like I related with him very well under the pretence of what I thought the relationship was. 7The complainant explained that he saw the respondent a few times after the two incidents but avoided any discussion of him returning to the respondent's house. The respondent eventually told the complainant that he could not be his friend if he was not going to go to his house and spend time with him. Their relationship soon ended.",

    "text": "13Chow, Mapara, Wasfi and Shoemaker were jointly charged with the first degree murder of Chand. Chand, while changing a licence plate on Chow's car in Mapara's car lot, was shot seven times by Shoemaker. 14The Crown's theory of the case was that Chow was privy to Chand's murder and knowingly remitted to the getaway driver, Binahmad, payment for the contract killing. 15Binahmad, a Crown witness who had been granted immunity from prosecution, testified that Mapara had hired Wasfi to murder Chand and that Wasfi, in turn, recruited Shoemaker to do the killing. He stated that Chow gave him $7,000 as a \"down payment\" on the contract, that he remitted the $7,000 to Shoemaker, and that Chow, at Wasfi's request, gave him an additional $2,000 after the killing to enable him to leave town. 16Chow's defence was that his payment to Binahmad had nothing to do with the murder and was not intended for Shoemaker. It related, he said, to a \"marijuana project\" that he had undertaken with Wasfi. 17Shoemaker did not testify. 18The Crown entered into evidence telephone conversations involving Chow, Wasfi and Mapara. The calls had been intercepted pursuant to eleven successive authorizations, of which the sixth and seventh yielded evidence crucial to the prosecution's case against Chow. Chow sought unsuccessfully to exclude this evidence underss. 8and24(2)of theCharter. 19Oppal J. rejected Chow's application. He noted that the use of electronic means to intercept private communications constitutes a search and seizure that will be deemed unreasonable unders. 8of theCharterunless judicially authorized in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.Section 185(1)(e) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, stipulates that the affidavit accompanying an application must disclose the existence of known persons (\"knowns\") whose conversations are targeted. Failure to do so will render unlawful any ensuing interception of a \"known's\" communications. 20Oppal J. thought there was \"much evidence to indicate that [the police] ought to have known about the existence or identity of Chow\" , 2001 BCSC 1815, at para. 32). He found it unnecessary, however, to determine whether Chow was a \"known\" when the first and second authorizations were sought and granted, since the Crown did not rely on any intercepts obtained as a result of any authorizations in which Chow was not named as a target.",

    "text": "Moreover, Oppal J. concluded that the validity of the first and second authorizations had no inherent bearing on the admissibility of the subsequent intercepts: since each authorization represented a separate order, its legality was to be independently determined. 21At the conclusion of the Crown's case, Chow and Wasfi both applied for severance. Oppal J. allowed Wasfi's application, but not Chow's. ApplyingR. v. Torbiak and Gillis(1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), he held that the \"issue to be ultimately determined by the court is whether the refusal to order a separate trial [would result] in a miscarriage of justice\". Oppal J. found that Chow's application failed on that test since Shoemaker's anticipated testimony was of \"marginal\" import. 22Chow and Mapara both testified. Shoemaker did not, but in a statement to the police admitted at the trial, he denied having received any payment at all for the killing. Chow testified that the intercepted telephone calls referred to a marijuana deal and that, in two calls, he realized that Wasfi was referring to a contract killing but said he was not interested. He said that he thought the money he paid to Binahmad was for the \"marijuana project\". 23Chow, Shoemaker and Mapara were all convicted by the jury of first degree murder. 24Chow and Mapara appealed. Chow's main grounds were that Oppal J. erred in refusing to grant him a separate trial and in admitting the wiretap evidence. He submitted as well that the verdict was unreasonable and sought to adduce \"fresh evidence\" in the form of an affidavit (a \"will say\" statement) by Shoemaker. The essence of the affidavit was that Shoemaker, if compelled to testify, would state that he had not received the $7,000 from Binahmad. 25Shoemaker was cross-examined by the Crown on his affidavit. On re-examination by Chow's counsel, he stated that Binahmad had told him, on the day Binahmad received the $7,000 from Chow, that he (Binahmad) had to attend a meeting about \"some old weed business\". 26Speaking for the Court of Appeal, Donald J.A. agreed with the trial judge that « Shoemaker's evidence was too marginal to justify a severance » .",

Chow's counsel stated that this aspect of Shoemaker's examination was not raised at the hearing of the appeal because of his instructions and because of the pressures of time. Neither explanation is compelling. 28Chow's application for a re-opening of the appeal was dismissed ((2003), 182 B.C.A.C. 88, 2003 BCCA 248).",

She asked the accused if he was Jim but he said nothing. The accused left at 5:15 or 5:30 a.m. After dressing the com­plain­ant telephoned her roommate once again. The roommate testified that the complainant sounded frightened. 15.The complainant went to her room and curled up on her bed. When the roommate got home at 6:45 a.m. she found the complainant terribly upset. She noticed a bruise on the complainant's eye. When the police constable arrived at 8:16 a.m. he also noted that the complainant seemed upset and a little incoherent. The complainant gave the policeman her torn nightgown and underwear. She showed him the coke bottle, glass and telephone (for the purpose of fingerprinting). 16.Doctor Lloyd Gordon examined the complainant at the emergency department of the Wellesley Hospital on December 7, 1983 at 11:15 a.m. He found a red mark over her left eyebrow. It was a mild abrasion such as might be caused by a moderate slap. The complainant also spoke of tenderness in the tailbone. Doctor Gordon noted, upon a vaginal examination of the complainant, that her cervix was slightly red. This was consistent with forced sexual intercourse. In cross‐examination he testified that it was also consistent with energetic sexual intercourse.",

He arrived at the building between 1:35 and 1:45 a.m., took the elevator, and began walking towards the apartment at the end of the hallway beside the stairwell. A first assailant emerged from the stairwell apparently holding a pistol. He was described as a black man and with a cloth over his face. The complainant could only see his eyes and could not identify him or any of the other assailants. A second masked man then emerged from the stairwell, also apparently armed. Three more masked men then emerged, but without weapons. The last three assailants grabbed the complainant's arms, seized the pizza and took Mr. Saleem's money and receipts from his pockets. Two of them took Mr. Saleem into the stairwell where they bound his hands and stuffed a cloth in his mouth. They removed Mr. Saleem's wallet and some change from his pockets. As they left, they loosened the bonds that tied him. 10The police found chicken bones and five Pizza Pizza receipts in the stairwell at about 4:00 a.m. that morning. Three fingerprints belonging to the respondent were found on the receipt for the delivery to the building. A fourth print belonged to another man who was charged as a young offender. The respondent turned himself in to the police on August 7, 2000 in response to an outstanding warrant for his arrest. His father lived in the apartment building where the robbery occurred. 11Although the phone call ordering the food was traced to a cellular phone owned by a man not connected to the case, there had been a brief call a few minutes earlier to the same pizza store from a cellular phone which the police said could be circumstantially linked to the respondent. That same cellular phone was used in connection with another robbery that took place on July 5, for which the respondent was later charged but tried separately.",

The Challenge for Cause 12The respondent was initially arraigned on March 18, 2002 on two counts of robbery of pizza deliverymen: the July 5, 2000 robbery (where the victim was white) and the June 28, 2000 robbery (where the victim was East Indian). The respondent did not deny that the robberies had occurred. The only issue was whether he could properly be identified as the perpetrator. 13Before successfully applying for a severance of the two charges, the respondent sought to challenge potential jurors for cause, based on the fact that he is black and the victims were white and East Indian respectively. The trial judge allowed a question based on the fact that the accused is black, but would not allow the additional enquiry addressing the race of the victim(s) or the resulting interracial nature of the crimes. (At the time of the challenge, of course, the potential jurors would not know the race of the accused, the complainant or the witnesses unless they were told.) 14The trial judge mistakenly remembered theParksquestion as relating only to the colour of the accused, not the colour of the complainant. However, he made it clear that in the exercise of his discretion he was limiting the challenge in this case to the race of the accused regardless of what the Ontario Court of Appeal had said inParks: GIOURGAS: Your Honour, just for clarification sake. Are you suggesting that I look atParksand if, in fact, it does say \"white\" then I can re-address the issue with Your Honour, or —",

He disputed the accuracy of the test and challenged the presumption set out in s. 258(1)(g)Cr. C.Although the expert tacitly alluded to the presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c)Cr. C.in saying that, if the alcohol had been consumed in the minutes preceding the breathalyzer test, the level recorded by the test might not have been the same as the level at the time Boucher was stopped, this was not the defence theory. Rothman J.A. was correct to say that the case concerned the nature of the evidence to the contrary required to rebut the presumption of accuracy, but the parties and the judges were wrong to refer to s. 258(1)(c)Cr. C. The question is therefore whether Mr. Boucher adduced evidence to the contrary that raised a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the breathalyzer results. 25Rothman J.A. found that the Municipal Court judge had failed to consider the evidence as a whole as required byW. (D.). In that case, this Court suggested an approach for determining whether guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt in cases where credibility is in question. That clarification was needed because the trial judge had told the jurors that, to reach a verdict, they had to decide whether they believed the defence evidence or the Crown's evidence. This charge was incorrect because it excluded a third possibility: that the jury could still have a reasonable doubt either because of the accused's testimony or in light of the evidence as a whole (p. 757). The instructions proposed in that case were as follows (at p. 758): (1) if the testimony of the accused is believed, the accused must be acquitted; (2) if the testimony of the accused is not believed but there is still a reasonable doubt, the accused must be acquitted; (3) even if the testimony does not raise any doubt, the jurors must still ask themselves whether, on the basis of all the evidence that they do accept, they are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. 26In the case at bar, the trier of fact did not believe the respondent and found that he had adduced no evidence to the contrary.",

    "text": "The Superior Court judge reversed the trial judgment, not on the basis of credibility, as he had been asked to do, but because he found that the judge had erred with respect to the standard of proof required to rebut the presumption. He was of the opinion that the evidence as a whole could raise a reasonable doubt about whether the accused's blood alcohol level exceeded the permissible limit at the time of the arrest . I myself do not think that the trier of fact committed an error that warrants intervention. 27In assessing the consequences of rejecting Mr. Boucher's testimony, I will begin by accepting the trier of fact's finding on credibility, and will then explain why there is no reason to intervene on the question of credibility. 2.1Consequences of Rejecting Mr. Boucher's Testimony 28What are the consequences of rejecting Mr. Boucher's testimony? According toProudlock, \"if the trier of fact does not believe the evidence so tendered, the statutory presumption operates\" in the absence of any other evidence (p. 542). Or as Fish J.A., as he then was, stated inR. v. Dubois(1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 90 (Que. C.A.): \"Evidence to the contrary\" that isdisbelievedwill, of course, fail to neutralize, or to render inoperative, the presumption created by s. 258(1)(c) of theCode. [Emphasis in original; p. 92.] 29With respect, the case at bar was not one to whichW. (D.)applied. To neutralize the presumption, the judge needed only to have a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the breathalyzer result. The approach set out inW. (D.)is not a sacrosanct formula that serves as a straitjacket for trial courts. Trial judges deliver oral judgments every day and often limit their reasons to the essential points. It would be wrong to require them to explain in detail the process they followed to reach a verdict. They need only give reasons that the parties can understand and that permit appellate review:R. v. Sheppard, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, 2002 SCC 26, andR. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656. In the instant case, the judge, by stating that she did not believe Mr. Boucher, was implicitly addressing the first two steps inW. (D.). 30What evidence other than Mr. Boucher's testimony, which was rejected, could have been taken into consideration?",

    "text": "The expert's evidence could have been, according to the Superior Court judge and Rothman J.A. of the Court of Appeal. 31The expert's opinion about the blood alcohol level the breathalyzer test should have shown was based on Mr. Boucher's testimony. The expert did not evaluate Mr. Boucher's resistance to alcohol. He simply provided average figures relating to the blood alcohol level of a 28‐year‐old man who weighs 175 pounds and is 5'11\" tall and who consumes 44 ounces of beer containing five percent alcohol over a period of two to three hours. If a judge does not believe that an accused consumed 44 ounces of beer, the expert's calculation is of no help. Such evidence merely provides theoretical information that differs from the facts on which judgment was based. If the expert evidence is based on the accused's testimony and the accused's testimony is not believed, the expert's evidence cannot assist the court or constitute evidence to the contrary. What else is left? 32The Superior Court judge and Rothman J.A. were of the opinion that the absence of symptoms other than the smell of alcohol was also a factor that could raise a reasonable doubt. Forget J.A., on the other hand, was of the opinion that this was a neutral factor. He was correct, in my view. 33Evidence that there are no symptoms is indeed very relevant to the charge of impaired driving. In fact, this explains why, when the prosecution closed its case, it asked the judge to acquit Mr. Boucher on that charge. The situation is quite different for the charge of driving with a blood alcohol level over 80 mg. The offence of driving with a level exceeding 80 mg does not require proof of impairment. The absence of symptoms of impairment is generally not sufficient to constitute evidence to the contrary that can be used to rebut the presumption of accuracy. This is because a lack of evidence of the usual symptoms of impairment, such as staggering and slurred speech, does not provide information about the actual blood alcohol level. Symptoms such as these usually accompany extremely high blood alcohol levels. Conversely, very low levels are generally consistent with an absence of symptoms.",

    "text": "Symptoms such as these usually accompany extremely high blood alcohol levels. Conversely, very low levels are generally consistent with an absence of symptoms. An absence of symptoms is therefore not significant in itself if the court does not know the accused's level of alcohol tolerance. 34The expert who testified in this case has not enlightened the Court about Mr. Boucher's alcohol tolerance. He relied on statistical averages. By definition, the reason there are averages is that not everyone who consumes alcohol reacts in the same way. The level of alcohol tolerance is not a matter for judicial notice, particularly when the case does not involve extremely high levels. The difference of opinion between two judges of the Court of Appeal on this point is certainly indicative of a need to rely on the usual methods of proof in this regard. Like Forget J.A., I agree with the following statement by Charron J.A., as she then was, inLatour: Second, and more importantly, this evidence is not capable of constituting \"evidence to the contrary\". Even accepting as a fact that a \"normal, average\" person with the same breathalyser readings should exhibit stronger indicia of impairment than that observed in the respondent, this fact is of no consequence in the absence of evidence on the respondent's tolerance to alcohol. This opinion evidence, as presented, without any connection to the respondent, is merely speculative and of no evidentiary value. [para. 14] 35Mr. Boucher's testimony, the expert evidence and the absence of the usual symptoms of intoxication (except the smell of alcohol) were not evidence to the contrary. What other evidence constituted evidence to the contrary? In the opinion of Rothman J.A., the low level recorded by the breathalyzer test was another factor that could raise a reasonable doubt. But I find it difficult to see how the fact that the alcohol levels were 93 mg and 92 mg (which Rothman J.A. characterized as low) could constitute evidence that the breathalyzer result was inaccurate. How can the results of 93 mg and 92 mg show that the result itself was inaccurate? The result is precisely the figure that the accused claimed was inaccurate. To achieve his goal, he should logically have tried to discredit that figure, not to use it.",

The result cannot be both evidence and evidence contrary to that evidence. 36The Municipal Court judge stated that, because she did not believe Mr. Boucher, the expert evidence was not evidence to the contrary. This statement implied that, of all the evidence she had heard, only the expert evidence would have been capable of constituting evidence to the contrary if it had had any basis. To reach that conclusion, she must necessarily have assessed the evidence as a whole. In my opinion, the Superior Court judge and Rothman J.A. could not reproach her for failing to consider the evidence as a whole. 37In short, unless Mr. Boucher's testimony is reassessed and given a different weight than the trial judge gave it, I see nothing that the trial judge rejected that she should have taken into consideration to find that there was a reasonable doubt. 38I will make one further comment on the expert's testimony about the difference in the levels, attributable to the absorption time, between the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed and the time of the test. This evidence was adduced as evidence to the contrary in relation to the presumption of identity. It is relevant to recall that the argument to which the expert alluded is not a new one. It was made inSt. Pierre, and this Court rejected it: If any evidence of difference between the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the testing and at the time of the driving could be considered \"evidence to the contrary\" within the meaning of s. 258(1)(c) so as to rebut the presumption, then the presumption could be rebutted in every case. The simple reason for this is that an intoxicated person's blood alcohol level is constantly changing as a result of absorption and elimination of alcohol into and out of the blood. A person charged with \"over 80\" could simply show that his blood alcohol level changed between driving and being stopped because some of the alcohol had been metabolized in the interim, and suddenly the presumption in s. 258(1)(c) would be gone. . . .",

A similar advertisement on the Internet described the atmosphere of the bar as \"warm and cozy\". 3\"Cœur à Corps\" had been in existence as a meeting place for liberated couples since 1985. It was only in 1996 that the police received a complaint and started an investigation into the potential commission of indecent acts. Undercover police officers attended at the bar five times between September and November 1996, and on three further occasions between January and March 1997. Two search warrants were issued and executed on the premises on November 16, 1996 and March 16, 1997, at which times the police arrested 62 and 95 persons, respectively, including both clients and employees. The respondent was charged with two counts of keeping a bawdy-house contrary tos. 210(1)of theCriminal Code. 4According to the evidence at trial, access to the bar was only open to couples and a doorman asked prospective clients if they were a \"liberated couple\". If the couple answered yes, they were permitted to enter after paying a $6 fee. The establishment had both a seating area and a dance floor.

Their applications were not joined, but the arguments before the British Columbia Court of Appeal were adopted by all five appellants. 6The transfers were the result of a direction from the Correctional Service of Canada (\"CSC\") to review the security classifications of all inmates serving life sentences in minimum-security institutions who had not completed their violent offender programming in the aftermath of a sensational crime committed by a former inmate in another province. CSC used computer applications to assist the classification review process. Mr. Roy, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Speer-Senner and Mr. Owen were advised that their transfers were based on a computerized reclassification scale which yielded a medium‐security rating. Mr. May was told that his security rating had been adjusted because the security classification tool could not rate him as minimum-security because he had not completed violent offender programming. There were no allegations of fault or misconduct. 7The appellants attacked the decision‐making process leading to their transfers.",

They submitted that a change in general policy, embodied in a direction to review the security classification of offenders serving a life sentence at Ferndale Institution using certain classification tools, was the sole factor prompting their transfers. They said that the transfers were arbitrary, made without any \"fresh\" misconduct on their parts, and made without considering the merits of each case. The appellants also claimed that their right to procedural fairness was breached by the failure to disclose the scoring matrix for one of the classification tools, leaving them unable to challenge the usefulness of that tool in the decision‐making process. 8The Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed thehabeas corpusapplication: [2001] B.C.J. No. 1939 (QL), 2001 BCSC 1335. Bauman J. first considered whether a provincial superior court had jurisdiction to review a federal prisoner's involuntary transfer on an application forhabeas corpus(withcertiorariin aid) and, in the affirmative, whether it should decline to exercise it. The issue arose because the Federal Court is grantedexclusivejurisdiction in respect ofcertiorariproceedings involving the decisions of federal tribunals by its constituent statute. 9Bauman J. found that he had jurisdiction to hear the application. He relied onR. v. Miller, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 613, which held that provincial superior courts have retained concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court to issuecertiorariin aid ofhabeas corpusto review the validity of a detention authorized or imposed by a federal board, commission or other tribunal as defined bys. 2of theFederal Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7(formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 (2nd Supp.)) (\"FCA\"). 10Bauman J. then dealt with the substantive issues, which he agreed to examine under hishabeas corpusjurisdiction. He found against the appellants. He held that they had not made out their allegations of failure to disclose relevant information, the computer matrix not being available, and that the transfers had not been arbitrary. In his opinion, although the transfers had been prompted by a general instruction issued to CSC, the decisions had been made after an individualized assessment of all relevant factors. He concluded that they had not been made in the absence or in excess of jurisdiction. The applications forhabeas corpusandcertiorariin aid were then dismissed. 11The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal: (2003), 188 B.C.A.C. 23, 2003 BCCA 536.",

On the jurisdiction issue, the Court of Appeal had asked for and received written submissions from counsel on the issue raised inSpindler v. Millhaven Institution(2003), 15 C.R. (6th) 183 (Ont. C.A.). 12InSpindler, prisoners had been placed in a maximum‐security prison as a result of a new policy applicable to convicted murderers. They raised arguments which were similar to the submissions of the appellants in the present appeals. The Ontario Court of Appeal had held that, where a remedy is available in the Federal Court on the exercise of a statutory power granted under a federal statute to a federally appointed individual or tribunal, the provincial superior court should decline to hear an application forhabeas corpusif no reasonable explanation for the failure to pursue judicial review in the Federal Court was offered by the petitioner. In doing so, the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the British Columbia Court of Appeal's decision inHickey v. Kent Institution (Director)(2003), 176 B.C.A.C. 272, 2003 BCCA 23. 13Ryan J.A. felt that those comments were particularly apt in the case at bar. Although the issues raised in these cases were not identical to those raised inSpindler, they all involved policies and procedures adopted by the Commissioner of Corrections in determining the security classifications of the appellants. In her view, these cases should have been heard by the \"specialized\" Federal Court. The appellants had offered no reasonable explanation for failing to pursue judicial review in the Federal Court, so Ryan J.A. was of the opinion that Bauman J. ought to have declined to hear the applications in these cases, though it is implicit from her reasons that he had jurisdiction to do so. Nevertheless, Ryan J.A. decided to examine the substantive issue, but she found no error in Bauman J.'s conclusion that there were no procedural flaws which would entitle the appellants to an order forhabeas corpus. 14Since the Supreme Court of British Columbia heard the application, the record indicates that the situation of most of the appellants has changed. On June 30, 2002, Mr. May was transferred from medium- to minimum-security confinement at Ferndale Institution. On February 6, 2003, Mr. Speer-Senner was also transferred back to Ferndale Institution.",

As Evans J.A. wrote inHarmer and Miller: . . . the charge must be so worded that the accused is afforded reasonable notice of the offence or offences alleged to be included in the principal offence charged. Moreover, the offence must be one which is properly included in the count. [p. 19] 34The question in this case is whether the Crown can bring sexual assault and/or sexual interference within any of the three categories of included offences. F.Application of the Law to the Facts 35In my view, it cannot be said that the respondent in this case was fairly notified that in meeting the charge of incest he was also required to defend against sexual assault or sexual interference as \"included\" offences. I would apply to this case what was said by Phillimore L.J. inR. v. Woods, [1969] 1 Q.B. 447 (C.A.), at p. 451: It is of the first importance that a man charged with an offence should know with certainty what it is he may be convicted of. No court should be encouraged to cast around to see whether somehow or other the words of the indictment can be found to contain by some arguable implication the seeds of some other offence. 36The fact of the matter is that the Crowncouldhave charged the respondent with sexual assault and sexual interference but in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion refrained from doing so. On the facts of this case, the rules governing \"included\" offences do not provide a remedy for this omission. 37As to the first category, there is nothing in theCriminal Codethat explicitly makes sexual assault or sexual interference an offence included in incest. 38As to the second category, it cannot be said that incest as \"described in the enactment creating it\" includes sexual assault or sexual interference. As discussed earlier, incest can be committed without any assault whatsoever. Consent is no defence:S. (M.),F. (R.P.). Nor must the victim be under fourteen years of age. The five accused persons inF. (R.P.)were all adults.",

The five accused persons inF. (R.P.)were all adults. The age of the complainant constitutes merely a factual circumstance which is irrelevant to whether or not the offence of incest is committed. 39As to the third category, it cannot be said that the wording of the count charging the respondent with incest described a sexual assault, or indeed gave any information from which an issue of non-consent could fairly be inferred, or suggested that the victim was underage and therefore was incapable of consenting. It is true, of course, that an allegation of incest includes the allegation of a physical act which, if done without consent, would be an assault. However, if the Crown wished to dispense with proof of non-consent by relying on s. 150.1(1), it was incumbent upon it to allege the factual condition precedent to the operation of s. 150.1(1), namely the fact that the victim was under fourteen years old. This was not done. The age of the victim would be for the Crown to prove, not for the defence to disprove. To repeat, for ease of reference, the count in the indictment read in its entirety: [translation]Between December 13, 1995 and May 31, 1999, at Québec in the district of Québec, did commit incest with C.R., knowing that person to be his daughter, thereby committing the indictable offence provided for insection 155(2)of theCriminal Code. 40The Crown says the evidence subsequently led in the case shows that commission of incest in this case would necessarily have involved the commission of sexual interference and a sexual assault due to the age of the daughter, and that the age of the daughter must have been within the knowledge of the respondent, but there is nothing in s. 662 that permits the Crown to supplement the allegations in the charge, or the elements of the enactment creating the offence, by reference to the personal knowledge of an accused. 41The corollary, to what I have said above however, is that acquittal on the charge of incest would not provide the respondent in these circumstances with a defence ofautrefois acquitto a charge of sexual assault or sexual interference.",

Mr. Hamilton had received a \"teaser\" e-mail advertising the \"Top Secret\"files, enticing him to purchase the product. Mr. Hamilton recycled the \"teaser\" and website format of the company he had purchased the files from, changing only the address, and began e‐mailing his own \"teaser\" and advertising the files on his website. The \"teaser\" was sent to between 300 and 500 people whose addresses he had acquired from published lists. He made in excess of 20 sales over a number of months. His activities came to the attention of the Edmonton police through complaints by some recipients of the spam‐mail who either reported it directly to the Edmonton police or to Interpol. 53The \"teaser\" that Mr. Hamilton received and subsequently used as his own did not make reference to the bomb or break and enter documents, but did refer extensively to the credit card number generator. The web page did not make reference to any illegal documents. The relevant parts of the \"teaser\" are reproduced in my colleague Fish J.'s judgment at para. 8. As one can see, the \"teaser\" reads like a typical advertisement for a product, asserting its supposed useful qualities in exaggerated terms. Mr. Hamilton received the files he purchased on disk and in hard copy. He testified that the package as a whole interested him, including the \"absurd material\" and the \"money-making opportunities\". According to him, he thought others might be similarly interested. 54Mr. Hamilton saw a computer generated list containing abbreviated names of the files. He testified that he skimmed through the file names, proceeding to read further into those that caught his attention. The computer list contained file names such as: bombs.txt, bombs2.txt, bombs3.txt, How to Break into a House.txt, and visa hacking.txt. Of the roughly 200 files consisting of 2000 pages of text, it is these 5 files, about 13 pages in length, that are relevant to the charges. Except for the \"visa hacking\" file, Mr. Hamilton testified that he never read or was aware of the files in question. 55The files related to explosive substances are best characterized as \"how to\" recipes.",

It is short and very basic. 56The \"visa hacking\" file provides instructions regarding the generation of credit card numbers, which is essentially an exercise in adding and subtracting from an original valid number. A search of Mr. Hamilton's computer revealed another document describing a credit card number generator that did not form part of the \"Top Secret\"files; however, Mr. Hamilton testified that he frequently downloaded information to his computer which he never read, this file being one such example. Furthermore, a handwritten list of Visa numbers was found. Mr. Hamilton had used the credit card number generator described in the files, his mother's credit card being the starting point. The numbers he generated were all valid save one, but a bank employee testified that no complaints were received regarding their improper use. Mr. Hamilton testified his motivation in generating numbers was to figure out the mathematics behind credit card number formulation, and not to actually use the numbers.

The van was observed by Private Steven Ettinger, a military police officer appointed under s. 134 of theNational Defence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‐4, as amended. Private Ettinger was on patrol in a marked military police truck and was accompanied by Corporal Chevrier. When observed by Private Ettinger, the brown van was travelling out the main gates of C.F.B. Shearwater at approximately 50 kilometres per hour in a 15 kilometres per hour speed zone. The two military police officers pursued the van through the gate, activated the siren and emergency lights on the police vehicle, and stopped the van on the public highway. 3.Mr. Nolan was the driver and only occupant of the van. He was asked by the military police officers to step out of the van. Private Ettinger testified that Mr. Nolan staggered slightly, that his eyes were glassy, that his breath smelled strongly of alcohol, and that Mr. Nolan appeared to be unsteady when he stooped to pick up his driver's license which had fallen to the ground. Corporal Chevrier testified to similar effect. Prompted by these observations, the military police officers placed Mr. Nolan in the back seat of the military police truck, drove him to the Military Police Section of C.F.B. Shearwater and Private Ettinger there issued a breathalyzer demand. The trial judge found as a fact that Private Ettinger had reasonable and probable grounds to issue the breathalyzer demand.

The theft charge related to stolen speakers and is not relevant to this appeal. The charge of manslaughter arose out of a fight between B.W.P. and Saleh, a 22-year-old refugee from Iraq. The fight started when B.W.P., who was intoxicated at the time, asked Saleh why he was staring at the two women who were with B.W.P. Saleh thereupon exited his vehicle and challenged B.W.P. to fight. During the course of the fight, B.W.P. swung a stocking-covered pool ball hitting Saleh's head two or three times. Saleh was able to drive away, but died from his head injuries a short time later. With no family members residing in Canada, Saleh's body was returned to Iraq for burial. Attempts to contact members of the family were unsuccessful and no victim impact statement was available at the sentence hearing. Considerable evidence was called concerning B.W.P.'s background and character including a transfer report, a pre-sentence report, psychological assessment reports and youth bail management reports. 8Although charged under theYoung Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1(\"YOA\"), B.W.P. was sentenced under theYCJA. Meyers Prov. Ct. J., for the Winnipeg Youth Justice Court, first held that the offence of manslaughter is a \"serious violent offence\" within the meaning ofs. 2of theYCJAand then turned to a consideration of the appropriate sentence: (2003), 176 Man. R. (2d) 218. After reviewing the guiding principles and purposes of sentencing found inss. 3(1), 38 and39, the provisions ofs. 50(1)of theYCJAon the limited applicability of Part XXIII of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and the relevant jurisprudence, the sentencing judge concluded that general deterrence is not consistent with the new sentencing philosophy under theYCJA. 9The sentencing judge reviewed the evidence concerning the offender, noting in particular B.W.P.'s supportive and stable family, aboriginal identity, minimal legal record, positive school attendance and performance, pro-social extracurricular activities and the positive comments from family members, school officials and hockey coaches. The sentencing judge also relied on the psychological assessment by Dr. Somers who found the risk of re-offending to be low and unlikely to be reduced by a period of custody, recommending rather that B.W.P. be maintained in the community.

    "text": "The sentencing judge held as follows: The purpose of sentencing under theYouth Criminal Justice Actis to provide just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the offender and promote his rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public. That rehabilitation and reintegration has been well underway since BWP's release from custody in December 2001. Except for one misstep for which he paid dearly by serving a period of time in custody while awaiting disposition, his march towards becoming a law-abiding member of the community has been most positive. . . . Separating BWP from society as urged by the Crown will in my opinion not address the long-term protection of the public as envisioned by theYouth Criminal Justice Act. However, allowing him to build on the progress he has made since his release from custody would meet that goal. [paras. 78 and 86] 10Meyers Prov. Ct. J. disagreed with the Crown's position that ss. 42(2)(n) and 42(2)(o) must be read in tandem so as to require the court to impose two-thirds of the sentence in custody and one-third under supervision. Rather, he took the view that s. 42(2)(o) gave him the discretion to determine the appropriate length of the custody and supervision portions of the sentence. He therefore sentenced B.W.P. to a 15-month custody and supervision order, in addition to the 108 days spent in pre-trial custody. He directed that B.W.P. serve one day in open custody and the remainder of the 15 months under conditional supervision in the community subject to 18 listed conditions, to be followed by a one-year supervised probation order subject to less restrictive conditions. 11The Crown appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal, arguing that the youth court judge erred in finding that general deterrence was not consistent with the philosophy of theYCJA. The Crown argued further that the sentencing judge erred by refusing to read s. 42(2)(o) in tandem with s. 42(2)(n) which requires that the supervision portion of the order be \"one half as long\" as the custody portion. Hamilton J.A., writing for the Manitoba Court of Appeal, affirmed the sentencing judge's decision and dismissed the appeal: (2004), 187 Man. R.

(J.J.), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 421, continues to apply and considered the conflicting jurisprudence on this point. She concluded that deterrence is not a principle for sentencing young persons under theYCJA: Under theYOA, the protection of society and the public was an important principle. While the long‐term protection of the public and respect for societal values remains important under theYCJA, Parliament has directed that this is achieved through rehabilitation, reintegration and accountability wherever possible. As Gorman, P.J., noted inC.M.P., the sentence of a young person is \"individualistic\" with a primary emphasis on rehabilitation. When I consider the wording of s. 50(1) in the context of the overall principles of theYCJA, I agree with those judges, like Werier, P.J., inA.E.B., and the sentencing judge here, who have ruled that deterrence is not to be considered when sentencing a young person. A judge cannot sentence one young person with the aim of sending a message to other youth. This would be at variance with the required focus on the young person being sentenced. I am also of the view that specific deterrence is not a principle of sentencing in light of the exclusion of this principle unders. 50(1)of theYCJA. Having said that, the sentence, and the judicial process itself, may very well have a deterrent effect on the young person and others. [para. 64] 13On the second issue, Hamilton J.A. held that the sentencing judge had properly concluded that s. 42(2)(o) gives a wider discretion than does s. 42(2)(n): The sentencing judge was correct to distinguish between subs. 42(2)(n) and 42(2)(o). I agree with counsel for B.W.P. that the ordinary meaning of s. 42(2)(o) is clear from its words and its context. A custody and supervision order under s. 42(2)(o) is but one of 18 sanctions that a sentencing judge may consider. It is different from subs. (n) and gives the judge broader discretion with respect to how long (or short) the custody period and community supervision period will be. Because s. 42(2)(o) only applies to presumptive offences, this broader discretion allows for the sentencing judge to increase the time in custody for these serious offences.",

However, this discretion does not preclude the judge from favouring the supervision period of the order, as the sentencing judge obviously did in this case. This discretion is consistent with the primary purpose of theYCJAto promote rehabilitation, reintegration and accountability through, wherever possible, non‐custodial sentences. [para. 73] 14The Crown appeals to this Court on the same two grounds. 2.2R. v. B.V.N. 15B.V.N. pled guilty to the offence of aggravated assault causing bodily harm. The charge arose out of B.V.N.'s activities as a drug dealer. A few days before the assault in question, B.V.N. and an associate accosted the complainant — a drug addict — over a drug debt, held a gun to his head, clicking the trigger several times, forced him into a car and took him to a relative's house to get money. That incident ended when the relative phoned the police, forcing B.V.N. and his associate to flee. A few days later, B.V.N. and his associate again accosted the complainant, threatened, punched, kicked and stabbed him. The complainant spent several days in the hospital. 16The evidence about the offender revealed a very unfortunate family background, no prior convictions for violent offences, but a history of suspension and expulsion from school for assault and drug trafficking, numerous problems in group homes, including threatening staff members, and possessions of weapons. A psychiatric report put him at high risk of engaging in serious and violent criminal activity. 17On the question of general deterrence, the sentencing judge compared the provisions of theYCJAwith the formerYOAand concluded that general deterrence is one factor, albeit a minor one, in determining the appropriate sentence under the new regime. Considering the circumstances of the offence and the offender, the sentencing judge imposed a nine-month custody and supervision order under s. 42(2)(n) (in addition to 81 days of pre-trial custody), with the custodial part of the order to be spent in closed custody: [2004] B.C.J. No. 153 (QL), 2004 BCPC 22. 18B.V.N. appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, arguing, among other grounds, that the sentencing judge erred in relying on the principle of general deterrence.",

According to the store owner and an employee, the robber was armed with a gun and a knife and he wore a grey sweat‐shirt with a hood. The store owner and the employee could not positively identify the gun, the knife or the sweat‐shirt found in the car driven by the respondent at the time of his arrest, except to say that the sweat‐shirt was similar in colour. An eyewitness saw a man running from the store to a car, and he noted the licence number of the car. The car had been stolen a few hours previously. 3.On October 28, two days after the robbery, police officers MacIver and Train, acting on information received, attended at E & R Simonizing on Caledonia Road in Toronto at around 1:30 p.m. Both officers were in plain clothes. At approximately 2:33 p.m., the respondent drove up to the premises in a car which answered the description of the stolen car used in the armed robbery. 4.The respondent left the car and proceeded to the office premises where Train was waiting. MacIver, who had been waiting in the parking lot, investigated the car. He saw a gun butt protruding from under the driver's seat. He put the gun into his hip pocket, and he then followed the respondent into the office. When the respondent entered the office, Train greeted him with \"Hi Ron\". The respondent asked \"Do I know you?\" At that stage, both officers identified themselves as police officers and showed the respondent their badges. They searched and handcuffed the respondent. 5.At 2:40 p.m., Train arrested the respondent for theft and possession of the stolen car and for the armed robbery of the Mac's Milk store.

The intruder, Harjit Singh Shoker, followed her when she fled to the kitchen to phone the police but he did not attempt to leave. On arrest, he told the police that he had been using a narcotic the previous day. Mr. Shoker did not testify at trial. He was convicted of breaking and entering a dwelling-house with intent to commit sexual assault. 5A psychological assessment report prepared by Dr. Whittemore for sentencing revealed that Mr. Shoker blamed his drug use for his behaviour, stating that he had been on speed at the time of the offence. The report described a history of substance abuse, starting with alcohol as a teenager and later drugs including heroin, speed, cocaine and marijuana. The report also referred to a similar incident that had occurred a few months earlier in respect of which Mr. Shoker had been charged and awaiting trial at the time of this offence. Mr. Shoker told Dr. Whittemore that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of this previous incident and thought he was at a friend's apartment. He was acquitted on that charge. Mr. Shoker did not feel that he needed treatment as he had not used drugs for the three months he had been in custody since his arrest. Describing Mr. Shoker's behaviour as disturbing, Dr. Whittemore suggested that the court might consider imposing a condition requiring him to submit to random urinalysis to assist in managing his risk in the community. 6The trial judge sentenced Mr. Shoker to 20 months' incarceration to be followed by a two-year period of probation subject to a number of conditions. The Crown did not ask that the order of probation include any condition for treatment or testing of bodily substances and the offender did not consent to those conditions. The following two conditions were later challenged by Mr. Shoker on his appeal before the British Columbia Court of Appeal: CONDITION 7: You shall attend for such treatment and counselling as directed by the Probation Officer and successfully complete any such programs to which you are referred. . . .

CONDITION 9: Abstain absolutely from the consumption and possession of alcohol and non prescription narcotics and to submit to a urinalysis, blood test or breathalyzer test upon the demand/request of a Peace Officer or Probation Officer to determine compliance with this condition. Any positive reading will be a breach of this condition. 7The Court of Appeal deleted the reference to \"treatment\" in Condition 7 because a treatment condition can only be imposed unders. 732.1(3)(g) of theCriminal Codewith the consent of the offender. In addition, as the majority of the court noted, there is no program in British Columbia for curative treatment in relation to the consumption of alcohol or drugs as described in para. (g.1). Condition 7 was amended accordingly and it is no longer in issue before this Court. The court also deleted the last sentence of Condition 9 for lack of jurisdiction — the sentencing judge could not predetermine that any positive reading would constitute a breach of probation as he had purported to do. The question of any breach would have to form the basis of a new charge against Mr. Shoker and be determined by a court in the usual way. 8Fresh evidence admitted before the Court of Appeal revealed that funding for urinalysis testing had been discontinued as of March 31, 2003, and the service was no longer available in British Columbia. Hence the question of urinalysis testing for this offender was effectively moot. However, the court considered whether at law an offender can be required under the terms of a probation order to submit to a demand for a sample of bodily substances, including breath, urine and blood. Levine J.A., Finch C.J.B.C. concurring, was of the view that the authority for imposing such a condition could be found ins. 732.1(3)(c) of theCriminal Codewith s. 732.1(3)(h) supporting this interpretation. Despite this finding, Levine J.A., in writing for the majority, held that the requirement to provide bodily samples, in the absence of a regulatory or statutory framework governing how the samples will be taken and tested, violatess. 8of theCharterand that the defect cannot be cured by judicial fiat.",

In his view, the power flowed rather from s. 732.1(3)(c) itself as \"a reasonable methodology to ensure that such an order is effective\" .

    "text": "2.1Court of Québec 6On January 13, 2003, Mr. Angelillo pleaded guilty in the Court of Québec to a charge of theft over $5,000, contrary to s. 334(a)Cr. C.More than 37 times over a period of about a month and a half, Mr. Angelillo, who was employed as a security guard, failed to make deposits his employer had instructed him to make and instead took the money for his own use, thus misappropriating more than $425,000. He used a large part of that amount to pay debts he had incurred to persons associated with organized crime, who were threatening him and his family. The police also seized $150,000 during a search of his home. 7For reasons that are not apparent from the record, the sentencing hearing was not completed until April 21, 2004, more than 15 months after the guilty plea. At that time, Judge Corte sentenced Mr. Angelillo to a term of imprisonment of two years less a day to be served in the community followed by two years' probation, and ordered him to pay $268,430 as restitution under s. 738Cr. C.In imposing this sentence, the court accepted the submissions of the defence rather than those of Crown counsel, who had asked for an unconditional three‐year term of imprisonment. 8Judge Corte noted that the offender had no criminal record, had pleaded guilty at the start of the proceedings and had expressed remorse, and that the pre‐sentence report was favourable to him. She also noted that Mr. Angelillo had three jobs at the time and was the sole source of support for his wife and for his three children, who were respectively 15 months, four years and seven years old. Referring to the pre‐sentence report dated May 15, 2003, the judge added that the offender [translation] \"has done some sincere soul‐searching about his inappropriate behaviour [and] has undertaken a rehabilitation process . . . and also counselling\", and that \"his time in court has had a major deterrent effect on him\". The report also stated that Mr. Angelillo was not dangerous and that his risk of re‐offending was low. Judge Corte noted that there was a special circumstance in Mr. Angelillo's case, namely that he had stolen because his life and the lives of his family were being threatened by creditors who had ties to organized crime.",

There was physical evidence confirming that Mr. Angelillo had been threatened, and this fact was not disputed by the Crown. Judge Corte therefore concluded that, in this instance, the penological objectives of deterrence and denunciation could be achieved by imposing a conditional sentence with certain conditions restricting Mr. Angelillo's freedom. 2.2Fresh Evidence 9Following that decision, the Crown introduced motions in the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal, for a stay of sentence and for leave to introduce fresh evidence. Through the last of these motions, the Crown intended to file evidence showing: (1) that, on August 20, 2003, Mr. Angelillo was arrested at an Insta‐Chèque counter while attempting to cash a forged certified cheque from the National Bank of Canada made payable to him in the amount of $12,000; and (2) that, on January 21, 2004, during a search of Mr. Angelillo's home, police officers found a National Bank stamp with the words [translation] \"certified cheque\" on it and a starter kit containing a set of non‐personalized cheques, which came from a National Bank branch where Mr. Angelillo worked as a cleaner. These allegations were the basis for the new charges against Mr. Angelillo. 10The Crown argues that this evidence was not available at trial and that it acted diligently to produce all the relevant evidence before Judge Corte. In support of this argument, the Crown has submitted an affidavit from the prosecutor responsible for the case at trial. The affidavit states that, in early June 2003, after the detective sergeant responsible for the case had committed an indiscretion by telling Mr. Angelillo the sentence the Crown intended to seek, Crown counsel told the detective sergeant that her presence at the sentencing hearing would no longer be required and that from then on counsel would be in contact only with the detective sergeant's supervisor. Before the hearing, counsel checked theplumitif, in which there was nothing about Mr. Angelillo, but did not contact either the detective sergeant or her supervisor.",

On April 21, 2004, shortly after Judge Corte handed down her sentence, the detective sergeant ran into counsel at the courthouse by chance and told her the facts that the Crown is now seeking to introduce as fresh evidence. According to the affidavit of the police officer responsible for the new investigation, the detective sergeant had been aware of this investigation since January 19, 2004. 2.3Court of Appeal 11The Quebec Court of Appeal (Beauregard, Mailhot and Doyon JJ.A.) dismissed the three motions filed by the Crown because, in the court's view, the evidence was not relevant. The court began by stating that, because of the presumption of innocence, the fact that Mr. Angelillo had been charged proved nothing. It added that, in the present case, what the Crown wished to prove was not that he had been charged with another crime, but that the charge was substantiated. The court rejected the Crown's submission that the fresh evidence was admissible as character evidence under the principles stated by Rosenberg J.A. inEdwards. In the court's view, it is contrary to the presumption of innocence to consider, in sentencing an accused, facts that could constitute the basis for a separate criminal charge that has not resulted in conviction . The court concluded that taking into account evidence of facts tending to establish that an accused has committed another offence of which he or she has not been convicted amounts to punishing the accused more severely for having committed an act in respect of which he or she might ultimately be found not guilty .",

    "text": "91The Court held that, generally, a witness's testimony before a preliminary inquiry will satisfy the test for threshold reliability, since the fact that it was given under oath and subject to contemporaneous cross-examination in a hearing involving the same parties and mainly the same issues will provide sufficient guarantees of its trustworthiness . In addition, the accuracy of the statement is certified by a written transcript which is signed by the judge, and the party against whom the hearsay evidence is tendered has the power to call the declarant as a witness. The inability of the trier of fact to observe demeanour was found to be \"more than compensated by the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness inherent in the adversarial, adjudicative process of a preliminary inquiry\" . The fact that the early common law was prepared to admit former testimony under certain circumstances indicated an implicit acceptance of its reliability notwithstanding the lack of the declarant's presence . Therefore, Lamer C.J. and Iacobucci J. concluded (at para. 79): For these reasons, we find that a witness's recorded testimony before a preliminary inquiry bears sufficient hallmarks of trustworthiness to permit the trier of fact to make substantive use of such statements at trial. The surrounding circumstances of such testimony, particularly the presence of an oath or affirmation and the opportunity for contemporaneous cross‐examination, more than adequately compensate for the trier of fact's inability to observe the demeanour of the witness in court. The absence of the witness at trial goes to the weight of such testimony, not to its admissibility. Applying this reasoning to the statement at issue, it was found to be reliable . 92Lamer C.J. and Iacobucci J. added that the trial judge had erred in considering the internal contradictions contained in the testimony because these considerations properly related to the ultimate assessment of the actual probative value of the testimony, a matter for the trier of fact. Although some of the analysis on this last point is couched in terms of categorizing factors as relevant to either threshold or ultimate reliability, an approach which should no longer be adopted, the Court's conclusion on this point exemplifies where the line should be drawn on an inquiry into threshold reliability.",

    "text": "When the reliability requirement is met on the basis that the trier of fact has a sufficient basis to assess the statement's truth and accuracy, there is no need to inquire further into the likely truth of the statement. That question becomes one that is entirely left to the ultimate trier of fact and the trial judge is exceeding his or her role by inquiring into the likely truth of the statement. When reliability is dependent on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement, the trial judge must inquire into those factors tending to show that the statement is true or not — recallU. (F.J.). 6.3Revisiting Paragraphes 215 and 217 in Starr 93As I trust it has become apparent from the preceding discussion, whether certain factors will go only to ultimate reliability will depend on the context. Hence, some of the comments at paras. 215 and 217 inStarrshould no longer be followed. Relevant factors should not be categorized in terms of threshold and ultimate reliability. Rather, the court should adopt a more functional approach as discussed above and focus on the particular dangers raised by the hearsay evidence sought to be introduced and on those attributes or circumstances relied upon by the proponent to overcome those dangers. In addition, the trial judge must remain mindful of the limited role that he or she plays in determining admissibility — it is crucial to the integrity of the fact-finding process that the question of ultimate reliability not be pre-determined on the admissibilityvoir dire. 94I want to say a few words on one factor identified inStarr, namely\"the presence of corroborating or conflicting evidence\" since it is that comment that appears to have raised the most controversy. I repeat it here for convenience: Similarly, I would not consider the presence of corroborating or conflicting evidence. On this point, I agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision inR. v. C. (B.)(1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 608; see alsoIdaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805 (1990). [para. 217] 95I will briefly review the two cases relied upon in support of this statement.

(3d) 608 (C.A.), the trial judge, in convicting the accused, had used a co‐accused's statement as evidence in support of the complainant's testimony. The Court of Appeal held that this constituted an error. While a statement made by a co-accused was admissible for its truth against the co‐accused, it remained hearsay as against the accused. The co-accused had recanted his statement at trial. His statement was not shown to be reliable so as to be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule against the accused. Therefore, this case is of no assistance on the question of whether supporting evidence should be considered or not in determining hearsay admissibility. It simply reaffirms the well-established rule that an accused's statement is only admissible against its maker, not the co-accused. 97Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805 (1990), is more on point. In that case, five of the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court were not persuaded that \"evidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement may properly support a finding that the statement bears 'particularized guarantees of trustworthiness'\" (p. 822). In the majority's view, the use of corroborating evidence for that purpose \"would permit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial, a result we think at odds with the requirement that hearsay evidence admitted under the Confrontation Clause be so trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility\" (p. 823). By way of example, the majority observed that a statement made under duress may happen to be true, but evidence tending to corroborate the truth of the statement would be no substitute for cross-examination of the declarant at trial. The majority also raised the concern, arising mostly in child sexual abuse cases, that a jury may rely on the partial corroboration provided by medical evidence to mistakenly infer the trustworthiness of the entire allegation. 98In his dissenting opinion, Kennedy J., with whom the remaining three justices concurred, strongly disagreed with the position of the majority on the potential use of supporting or conflicting evidence.",

    "text": "In my view, his reasons echo much of the criticism that has been voiced about this Court's position inStarr. He said the following: I see no constitutional justification for this decision to prescind corroborating evidence from consideration of the question whether a child's statements are reliable. It is a matter of common sense for most people that one of the best ways to determine whether what someone says is trustworthy is to see if it is corroborated by other evidence. In the context of child abuse, for example, if part of the child's hearsay statement is that the assailant tied her wrists or had a scar on his lower abdomen, and there is physical evidence or testimony to corroborate the child's statement, evidence which the child could not have fabricated, we are more likely to believe that what the child says is true. Conversely, one can imagine a situation in which a child makes a statement which is spontaneous or is otherwise made under circumstances indicating that it is reliable, but which also contains undisputed factual inaccuracies so great that the credibility of the child's statements is substantially undermined. Under the Court's analysis, the statement would satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause despite substantial doubt about its reliability. [pp. 828-29] 99Kennedy J. also strongly disagreed with the majority's view that only circumstances surrounding the making of the statement should be considered: The [majority] does not offer any justification for barring the consideration of corroborating evidence, other than the suggestion that corroborating evidence does not bolster the \"inherent trustworthiness\" of the statements. But for purposes of determining the reliability of the statements, I can discern no difference between the factors that the Court believes indicate \"inherent trustworthiness\" and those, like corroborating evidence, that apparently do not. Even the factors endorsed by the Court will involve consideration of the very evidence the Court purports to exclude from the reliability analysis. The Court notes that one test of reliability is whether the child \"use[d] . . . terminology unexpected of a child of similar age.\" But making this determination requires consideration of the child's vocabulary skills and past opportunity, or lack thereof, to learn the terminology at issue.",

    "text": "And, when all of the extrinsic circumstances of a case are considered, it may be shown that use of a particular word or vocabulary in fact supports the inference of prolonged contact with the defendant, who was known to use the vocabulary in question. As a further example, the Court notes that motive to fabricate is an index of reliability. But if the suspect charges that a third person concocted a false case against him and coached the child, surely it is relevant to show that the third person had no contact with the child or no opportunity to suggest false testimony. Given the contradictions inherent in the Court's test when measured against its own examples, I expect its holding will soon prove to be as unworkable as it is illogical. The short of the matter is that both the circumstances existing at the time the child makes the statements and the existence of corroborating evidence indicate, to a greater or lesser degree, whether the statements are reliable. If the Court means to suggest that the circumstances surrounding the making of a statement are the best indicators of reliability, I doubt this is so in every instance. And, if it were true in a particular case, that does not warrant ignoring other indicators of reliability such as corroborating evidence, absent some other reason for excluding it. If anything, I should think that corroborating evidence in the form of testimony or physical evidence, apart from the narrow circumstances in which the statement was made, would be a preferred means of determining a statement's reliability for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, for the simple reason that, unlike other indicators of trustworthiness, corroborating evidence can be addressed by the defendant and assessed by the trial court in an objective and critical way. [References omitted; pp. 833-34.] 100In my view, the opinion of Kennedy J. better reflects the Canadian experience on this question. It has proven difficult and at times counterintuitive to limit the inquiry to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement. This Court itself has not always followed this restrictive approach. Further, I do not find the majority's concern over the \"bootstrapping\" nature of corroborating evidence convincing.

In fact, the \"bootstrapping\" label is usually reserved to circular arguments in which a questionable piece of evidence \"picks itself up by its own bootstraps\" to fit within an exception. For example, a party claims it can rely on a hearsay statement because the statement was made under such pressure or involvement that the prospect of concoction can fairly be disregarded, but then relies on the contents of the hearsay statement to prove the existence of that pressure or involvement [Ratten v. R., [1972] A.C. 378 (P.C.)]. Or, a party claims it can rely on the truth of the contents of a statement because it was a statement made by an opposing party litigant, but then relies on the contents of the statement to prove it was made by an opposing party litigant: seeR. v. Evans, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869. Looking tootherevidence to confirm the reliability of evidence, the thingIdaho v. Wrightpurports to prevent, is the very antithesis of \"bootstrapping\".",

    "text": "3On July 6, 1995, the appellant, Stephen Trochym, was convicted of second degree murder by a judge sitting with a jury. The deceased, Donna Hunter, was the appellant's girlfriend of almost one year. 4Ms. Hunter was last seen alive late on Tuesday, October 13, 1992, or in the early hours of Wednesday, October 14. The Crown's theory at trial was that the appellant had killed Ms. Hunter in a fit of rage after she had attempted to end their troubled relationship. Several of Ms. Hunter's friends testified that the appellant was a jealous and obsessive partner who could not tolerate the thought of her leaving him. However, the appellant, who testified in his own defence, claimed that it was he who had ended the relationship that night and that when he left Ms. Hunter's apartment at 12:30 a.m., she was still alive. 5Late on Tuesday, October 13, or in the early morning hours of Wednesday, October 14, Gity Haghnegahdar, a neighbour of Ms. Hunter's, heard a man banging on the door of the deceased's apartment, demanding to be let in. Although she did not see the man, Ms. Haghnegahdar heard the door eventually open to admit him. Given the estimated time of death, it was likely that the man who entered the apartment at that time was Ms. Hunter's killer. Establishing that it was the appellant knocking at the door was a key aspect of the Crown's case. To this end, the Crown was permitted to adduce evidence that following Mr. Trochym's breakup with a previous girlfriend (Darlene Oliphant) two years earlier, he had returned to her apartment and banged on the door, demanding to be let in. 6The neighbour, Ms. Haghnegahdar, also testified at trial that she had seen the appellant leaving Ms. Hunter's apartment around 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon. This testimony was considered critical by the Crown and was characterized as significant by the trial judge. The Crown sought to use it to establish that Mr. Trochym had returned to Ms. Hunter's apartment in the afternoon after the murder to \"stage the scene\" of the crime. By removing some personal effects and moving the body to make it appear as though the murder had been sexually motivated, the Crown argued, the appellant sought to distract attention from himself.",

    "text": "By removing some personal effects and moving the body to make it appear as though the murder had been sexually motivated, the Crown argued, the appellant sought to distract attention from himself. The Crown's theory was supported by forensic evidence that established that the deceased had been killed in the early hours of Wednesday morning, but that her body had been repositioned some eight to twelve hours after the murder. 7A key fact on appeal, however, was Ms. Haghnegahdar's statement, when first interviewed by the police, that she had seen the appellant onThursdayafternoon, not Wednesday. It was only after undergoing hypnosis at the request of police investigators that Ms. Haghnegahdar stated that she had seen the accused on Wednesday afternoon. 8The appellant denied having returned to Ms. Hunter's apartment, but admitted that he had returned to the apartment building to retrieve his car from the parking garage on Wednesday. To support his claim, Mr. Trochym adduced evidence that he was at work at the time the witness claimed to have seen him leaving the deceased's apartment on Wednesday afternoon. The Crown argued that the appellant's evidence on this point was concocted and further argued that the appellant's demeanour in the days subsequent to the discovery of the deceased's body was evidence of consciousness of guilt. When asked to attend a second meeting with the police, the appellant had made excuses not to attend, claiming that he was otherwise occupied with a darts game and a haircut appointment. Mr. Trochym testified at trial that he had been attempting to \"stall\" until he could consult with counsel, but the Crown suggested to the jury that the appellant's post-offence conduct established that the appellant had lied when he claimed he wanted to help officers with their investigation, and that this was evidence of consciousness of guilt, because the appellant was evading police. Although this evidence was admitted, the trial judge instructed the jury that it \"would be completely wrong to draw any adverse inference against the [appellant] from his desire to stall for time because he wanted to consult with a lawyer\" (A.R., at p. 3736). 9Following a 14-week trial, Mr. Trochym was convicted of second degree murder on July 6, 1995.",

    "text": "The trial judge's different treatment of Farmer would be understandable if Clayton and Farmer had been two unconnected pedestrians who happened to be leaving the Million Dollar Saloon parking lot at the same time, but independently. However that is not this case. Farmer, being black, fit the general description by the 911 caller. He was leaving the parking lot in the same car as Clayton soon after the 911 gun call. Once the trial judge concluded that sufficient grounds existed to require Clayton to get out of the car and submit to a search for reasons of police safety incidental to detention it follows, I think that it would have been foolhardy for the police, in the context of a gun call, to leave Farmer, possibly armed, in the car while they went about their business with Clayton. Nor could the police be expected to allow Farmer to drive away. If Farmer, left alone in the driver's seat, had taken a shot at the police, there would have been legitimate questions raised about police training and police judgment and the unreality of a law that led to such an avoidable result. The respondents were travelling together and the concerns about officer safety raised by the glove-wearing, possibly gun-flourishing Clayton gave rise to a sufficient concern about the driver to warrant a pat-down search of Farmer for officer safety incidental (at that point) to Farmer's continued detention. Nevertheless, this point is complicated in Farmer's case because, before he was searched, he was arrested. 125Farmer was out of the car and was putting his hands on the roof when Clayton tried to bolt (trial judgment, at paras. 23-24). The arresting officer initially testified that he did not arrest Farmer until after he received word that Clayton had a gun. However, the police tapes showed thisnotto be the case. The arresting officer had no such information. Accordingly, the trial judge concluded that \"[a] reasonable person placed in [Constable] Mulholland's position could not conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest\" . The search of Farmer took placeafterhis arrest. The trial judge therefore found: The search was conducted in a reasonable manner and incident to an arrest.",

However, the arrest was unlawful and the search violated Mr. Farmer's s. 8 rights. [para. 83] The trial judge thus treated the intervening arrest as determinative of Farmer's rights. It seems to me overly formalistic however to hold that, while the police were entitled to conduct a pat-down search of Farmer incidental to his continued detention, the entitlement vanished with the wrongful pronouncement of the words of arrest, even though the officer safety issue remained the same. To put it another way, I do not think the effect of the arrest can be said to haveenlargedFarmer's reasonable expectation of privacy. An arrest, of course, gives the police greater powers of search than aManndetention, but the fact is that what happened to Farmer was a pat-down search well within the bounds of aManndetention. 126I would therefore hold that the pat-down search of Farmer that resulted in the seizure of the gun was not rendered unconstitutional by the words of arrest that intervened between getting Farmer out of the car and the police pat-down search to ensure officer safety. Had I concluded otherwise, I would, nevertheless, have agreed with the trial judge that the gun should be admitted under s. 24(2).

The court looks first at the effect of the admission of the impugned evidence on the fairness of the trial, second at the seriousness of theCharterviolation and third at the negative impact, if any, on the administration of justice that would be occasioned by the admission of the evidence. Both the trial judge and Doherty J.A. agreed, as do I, that admission of the gun would not affect trial fairness. Doherty J.A.'s view of the seriousness of theCharterbreach was predicated on his conclusion that the original blockade detention was unconstitutional. He states: Farmer and Clayton were entitled to proceed on their way. Instead, they found themselves in a potentially demeaning and frightening confrontation with the police. The roadblock stop led to a serious violation of theirCharterrights. The significance of theCharterbreaches is not minimized because it turns out that Farmer and Clayton were in possession of loaded prohibited weapons. . . . Criminals do not have different constitutional rights than the rest of the community. [paras. 77-78] On the s. 24(2) point, I accept the conclusion of the trial judge who held that, while theCharterviolations were not \"technical or trivial, they were not serious enough as to support exclusion\" . In support of his conclusion the trial judge observed that the violations occurred in a fast-paced situation, where the officer had little time for reflection. . . . . . . the fact it was a gun call is an important consideration. Constable Mulholland saw the Robson-Clayton struggle and Clayton's flight. . . . As regards the search incident to arrest, the officer honestly but mistakenly believed he had the information that would give him reasonable and probable grounds. Again, there is no bad faith. [paras. 95 and 97-98] 129As stated, Doherty J.A. made an important point about the potential contribution of inadequate training to excessive police conduct.

The group socialized and drank until about 10:15 p.m., when they went bowling. They bowled and drank at the bowling alley until about midnight. Most of the group then went to the Crown and Hand bar in the neighbourhood. They drank until the bar closed at 3:30 a.m. The group then went back to Tyler Sanjenko's home to pick up some alcohol and continued on to the home of the appellant and Teanda Manchur. They arrived prior to 4 a.m. and spent the next while drinking, looking at the appellant's motorcycles in his garage and touring his house.

He testified that the appellant had difficulty keeping his balance, stumbled up the stairs and had to hold onto a counter to hold himself up, and had slurred speech. On departing, the appellant put his helmet on backwards and had difficulty putting on his boots.

Evidently intoxicated and unsteady on his feet, he woke up his neighbour and welcomed him to the neighbourhood. He was obviously drunk and went up and down the stairs a few times repeating the greetings and then stumbled away. [10]Other neighbours observed the appellant. Mr. Jack Mohr was awakened by the motorcycles returning and after that heard the appellant yell \"Let me in, you fuckin' bitch.\" Mrs. Mohr was awake reading and saw the appellant outside, apparently trying to get into his home, around 5 a.m. She heard him yelling the same phrase about five times.

There was a corresponding hole in her blood-covered jeans that were found elsewhere in the house. That wound was not fatal.

He made this context clear in his subsequent judgment (dissenting, but not on this point) inR. v. Pappajohn, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, where he aptly summed up the pre-Charterlegal landscape as follows: There rests now, at the foundation of our system of criminal justice, the precept that a man cannot be adjudged guilty and subjected to punishment, unless the commission of the crime was voluntarily directed by a willing mind. Blackstone spoke of a \"vicious act\" consequent upon a \"vicious will\" (Commentaries, Book IV, at p. 21). Proof of the mental element is an essential and constituent step in establishing criminal responsibility. Parliament can, of course, by express words, create criminal offences for which a guilty intention is not an essential ingredient. Equally,mens reais not requisite in a wide category of statutory offences which are concerned with public welfare, health and safety. Subject to these exceptions,mens rea, consisting of some positive states of mind, such as evil intention, or knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, or reckless disregard of consequences, must be proved by the prosecution. The mental element may be established by inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence. [pp. 138-39] 3.2Fundamental Principles of Criminal Justice Under theCharter [24]With the advent of theCharter, the parameters of valid federal and provincial legislation became defined, not only along division of powers lines but by minimal constitutional requirements. Therefore, with theChartercame a renewed interest in the mental elements of crimes and regulatory offences. To what extent had the fundamental principles of criminal justice that gave rise to the common law presumptions onmens reabecome constitutionally entrenched? The question came to the fore shortly after theChartercame into force inRe B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486. [25]The British ColumbiaMotor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, provided for minimum periods of imprisonment for the offence of driving on a highway or industrial road without a valid driver's licence or with a licence under suspension. Moreover, s. 94(2) of the Act provided that this offence was one of absolute liability in which guilt was established by the proof of driving, whether or not the driver knew of the prohibition or suspension.",

    "text": "Moreover, s. 94(2) of the Act provided that this offence was one of absolute liability in which guilt was established by the proof of driving, whether or not the driver knew of the prohibition or suspension. On a reference brought by the provincial government, the British Columbia Court of Appeal found s. 94(2) inconsistent withs. 7of theCharterand of no force or effect. The decision was upheld by this Court. Lamer J. (as he then was) made it clear that in the post-Charterera, absolute liability and imprisonment cannot be combined. This holds true regardless of whether imprisonment is mandatory or not. Though absolute liability provisions are not in and of themselves unconstitutional, they will be offensive to principles of fundamental justice entrenched unders. 7of theCharterto the extent that they have the potential of depriving of life, liberty, or security of the person. The fundamental principle at play was stated as follows (at p. 513): It has from time immemorial been part of our system of laws that the innocent not be punished. This principle has long been recognized as an essential element of a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and on the rule of law. It is so old that its first enunciation was in Latinactus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea. [26]It therefore became clear thatmens rea, as a presumed element inSault Ste. Marie, had acquired a constitutional dimension. As noted subsequently inR. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636 (where the Court held that subjectivemens reawas constitutionally required in respect of the offence of murder):",

    "text": "[6]On September 20, 2005, Jill Marie McIvor was sentenced to a 12-month conditional sentence for a number of property-related offences. Among other conditions, the conditional sentence order required that Ms. McIvor: (1) not be in the direct company of her co‐accused without permission from her sentence supervisor; (2) unless authorized in writing by her supervisor, or required to be outside her residence for abona fidemedical emergency, obey a curfew between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.; (3) keep the peace and be of good behaviour; and (4) not possess identification, credit cards, cheques or documents in any name other than her own. It is alleged that Ms. McIvor breached these four conditions. [7]The facts in support of the alleged breaches all arise out of a motor vehicle collision which occurred during the late evening hours of September 25, 2005. It is alleged that the circumstances surrounding the collision reveal that: (1) Ms. McIvor was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her co-accused, Dean Pelley; (2) she was outside of her residence past her curfew; (3) she was in possession of stolen property located in the vehicle; and (4) some of the stolen property included identification and other documents in the names of third parties. [8]At the breach hearing, the Crown relied exclusively on the supervisor's report, adduced in accordance with the notice and service requirements under s. 742.6(5) and (6). The report, signed by the supervisor, set out the relevant conditions and stated that Jill Marie McIvor had not been given permission to be out beyond her curfew or to be in contact with her co-accused. Attached to the supervisor's report was a comprehensive police report prepared by the investigating officer, summarizing the information obtained from several witnesses concerning the circumstances surrounding the motor vehicle collision. The witnesses named in the report included Ms. McIvor's co‐accused, some eyewitnesses to the collision, police officers attending at the scene, and the persons who identified as their property the items found in the car occupied by Ms. McIvor and her co‐accused. No signed statements from any of these witnesses was included in the police officer's report. The investigating officer who prepared the report was not himself a witness to any of the material facts and his report was not signed.",

The investigating officer who prepared the report was not himself a witness to any of the material facts and his report was not signed. It simply concluded with the typewritten words: \"Respectfully Submitted. Paul DOUGLAS #160 Traffic Safety Unit\". [9]On a preliminary motion, Ms. McIvor's counsel sought a dismissal of the breach allegations on the ground that the supervisor had failed to include \"signed statements of witnesses\" with his report, contrary to s. 742.6(4). The hearing judge rejected this argument, holding that the comprehensive police report was a formal document created by investigators for the use of prosecutors and that it would not be \"appropriate\" for the court to \"insist on a technicality of the signature given the overall scheme of the section dealing with conditional sentence breaches and the nature of the document itself\". He proceeded with the hearing, found Ms. McIvor in breach, terminated the conditional sentence order and committed her to custody until the expiration of her sentence. [10]The hearing judge's decision was overturned by a majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Smith J.A. held that the hearing judge seemingly misapprehended Ms. McIvor's argument by focussing on whether the report to Crown counsel was signed, rather than on its contents. Smith J.A. found it unnecessary to decide whether the report was \"signed\" by Constable Douglas because, in his view, the comprehensive police report could not be a witness statement within the meaning of s. 742.6(4) because a \"witness\" is a person present at an event and able to give information about it. \"Statements of witnesses\" must then refer to written accounts of the facts alleged to constitute a breach prepared by persons having knowledge of those facts. That s. 742.6(8) allows the offender, with leave, to cross-examine the supervisor and any witness whose statement is included, lent further support to this interpretation. The supervisor's report lacked signed statements of witnesses, and could therefore not be admitted in evidence. Accordingly, Smith J.A. set aside the order of the hearing judge and restored the conditional sentence. [11]Hall J.A. dissented, holding that Constable Douglas's report was functionally equivalent to a signed witness statement.",

Pursuant to s. 582 of theCriminal CodeAbbey admitted, amongst others, the following facts alleged against him, for the purpose of dispensing with proof. On Sunday, May 13, 1979, Abbey arrived at the Vancouver International Airport on C.P. Air Flight No. 421 from Lima, Peru. He entered Canada carrying a brown shoulder bag containing two clear plastic bags the contents of which weighed 5.5 ounces and analyzed to be approximately 50 per cent pure cocaine. After disembarkation, Abbey proceeded directly to the Canada Customs primary counter where he presented his passport and a signed customs declaration. He then obtained his suitcase from a baggage carousel and proceeded to the Customs secondary counter. Abbey placed the suitcase and shoulder bag on the counter. The Customs Inspector looked into the shoulder bag and observed a camera case and underneath it two plastic bags of white powder, the cocaine. The following conversation ensued between the Customs Inspector, Jung, and Abbey: Jung: (holding the two plastic bags of white powder). \"What is it?\" Abbey: \"You got me.\" Jung: \"What is it?\" Abbey: \"It's coke.\" R.C.M.P. Constable Giesbrecht arrived on the scene: [page27] Giesbrecht: (indicating the brown shoulder bag). \"What's in here?\" Abbey:\"Naturally cocaine.\"Giesbrecht: \"How much?\" Abbey: \"130 to 150 grams.\" Giesbrecht: \"You need not say anything, however, anything you do say may be given in evidence. You understand this?\" Giesbrecht: \"What's the white powder?\" Abbey: \"Cocaine.\" Giesbrecht: \"You brought the cocaine into the country?\" Abbey: \"Yes.\" Giesbrecht: (indicating the brown shoulder bag). \"Did you bring this suitcase into the country?\" Abbey: \"Yes.\" Later in the day Abbey gave the police a signed statement in which he said that in the last two weeks of April, 1979, while still in Canada, he had received $900 from three individuals on the express understanding that he would purchase 13 grams of cocaine for them in Peru. The two plastic bags contained 158.7 grams of cocaine, the \"street value\" of which was $76,320, if cut to 13 per cent purity, or $18,150 if sold, uncut, by the ounce. It was a profit venture.

As I have said, the only defence raised was s. 16(2) of theCriminal Code,insanity. Section 16 of theCodereads: 16. (1) No person shall be convicted of an offence inrespect of an act or omission on his part while he was insane. [page28] (2) For the purposes of this section a person is insanewhen he is in a state of natural imbecility or has diseaseof the mind to an extent that renders him incapable ofappreciating the nature and quality of an act or omissionor of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

(4) Every one shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane. As witnesses, the Crown called the customs inspectors and R.C.M.P. officers who searched and questioned Abbey at the airport. They said that Abbey appeared \"normal\" in their dealings with him. Abbey did not testify. The defence called only one witness, Dr. Vallance, a psychiatrist. In rebuttal the Crown called another psychiatrist, Dr. Eaves. No other witnesses gave testimony. Dr. Vallance testified that he first saw Abbey approximately 10 weeks after the commission of the offence. Dr. Vallance's testimony was based on his interviews with Abbey, his interviews with Abbey's mother, his review of a medical report prepared by another psychiatrist, and his discussions with other doctors who were involved in treating Abbey. In particular, Dr. Vallance relied on Abbey's description of the events surrounding his trip to South America as indicative of his mental state at the material time.",

Dr. Vallance's opinion was that Abbey, at all material times, was suffering from a disease of the mind, a manic illness, known as hypomania. While Abbey appreciated that he was bringing cocaine into Canada and knew that what he was doing was wrong, he believed that, if caught, he would not be punished. Dr. Vallance said: He had a considerable disturbance of mood. He haddelusional ideas. He had hallucinatory experiences. It'sdifficult under circumstances like that to fully appreciate what you are doing, particularly when the feelings and delusional ideas are tangled up with what you aredoing. If you feel that you are for some delusional ideainordinately powerful or safe then that impairs good [page29] judgment. I am sure he had some appreciation of whathe was doing. Dr Vallance further testified that, while Abbey was not rendered totally incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts by reason of the disease of mind from which he suffered, there was a degree of impairment of judgment. He had the feeling that he was being looked after by some outside force that was feeding him strength and that no harm would come to him and even if he did get caught it did not matter because somehow he would be looked after. Dr. Vallance made reference to Abbey's delusional belief that he was committed to a particular path of action which he could not change and his further delusional idea, while in Lima, Peru, that he had \"astro-travelled\" back to Vancouver already and that in getting on the plane in Lima to fly home he was simply having the body follow where the \"rest\" had already gone. Dr. Eaves, in rebuttal, was of the opinion that the disease of the mind experienced by Abbey, hypomania, would \"not be substantially enough to render him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his actions ... not to know that his actions were wrong\". The trial judge found that Abbey suffered from a disease of the mind. This was common ground. Both doctors agreed, however, that Abbey knew what he was doing and he knew that it was wrong.",

Both doctors agreed, however, that Abbey knew what he was doing and he knew that it was wrong. They disagreed on their assessment of the degree of Abbey's capability as of May 13, 1979. The judge found that disease of the mind incapacitated his ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts to the degree required to meet the test of s. 16(2). More particularly, Abbey did not \"appreciate\" the consequences of punishment associated with the commission of the offence. After referring to the decision of this Court inCooper v. The Queen,[1980] 1 S.C.R. 1149, the trial judge did find that Abbey \"had the capacity to appreciate the nature of the act of importing and of possessing the Cocaine\". He continued: As I understand the evidence and the submissions ofcounsel, the Accused had the capacity to appreciate thenature of the act of importing andofpossessing the [page30] Cocaine. He also had the capacity to appreciate the immediate consequences of those acts. That is to say that they were illegal; that he should not commit themovertly; that if he succeeded he must then deliver someof the Cocaine to his friends who gave him the money for it, and find someone through another friend who would buy the rest at a large profit to himself. He hadthe capability, in that sense, of analysing the knowledgeof what he was about, and he—in using the word \"analysing\" I adopt the definition given by Mr. JusticeEstey in the Supreme Court of Canada decision,Reginav. Barnier(1980)2W.W.R.659. The trial judge, however, did not stop there. He went on to consider \"whether the law requires that an accused also be able to appreciate, in the sense of which I have read from Mr. Justice Estey's decision, the consequences that may be personal to him. That is to say, the consequence of punishment.\" In finding Abbey not guilty by reason of insanity the judge concluded that \"one, who like Abbey suffers from the delusion that he is protected from punishment by some mysterious external force which comes to him, as described in the evidence of Dr. Vallance, has his ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts incapacitated to the degree required to meet the test of Section 16, Subsection 2.",

They observed Mr. Graat's car weaving in the southbound lane, crossing the centre line on two occasions and driving onto the shoulder of the road on another occasion.

The sergeant testified he smelled alcohol on the appellant's breath, the top part of his body was swaying, and his walk was \"kind of wavy\". Mr. Graat complained of chest pains. He told the police he suffered from a heart condition and asked to be taken to a hospital. The police complied. By the time Mr. Graat returned to the police station it was too late to take two breath samples because the two-hour time limit for the taking of such samples had expired or was about to expire.

Wilson drove the car while he dozed in the back seat. The appellant resumed driving after Wilson had driven O'Donovan and himself home.

In my opinion the accused's ability was impaired by the use of alcohol to drive a motor vehicle. No objection was taken at trial to the admission of any of this evidence. Indeed, at the conclusion of the examination in chief of Sergeant Spoelstra, the following exchange took place: ALLAN: [Crown Counsel] Your witness. Oh, wait a minute, what if any opinion, did you form regarding his ability to drive a motor vehicle from what you saw? From what I saw. THE COURT: Just one moment, please. This man's a desk sergeant, he's not the man in the field, so to speak. Do you say I should permit him to give his opinion? [Page 823] MR. ALLAN: Your Honour, with respect, even if he didn't see the accused man driving, if the sergeant... SILVER: [then counsel for the defence] I can save time, Your Honour, I'm quite content with it. THE COURT: Thank you. Proceed. I do not think failure on the part of defence counsel to object to the admission of inadmissible evidence should, in the circumstances of this case, stand in the way of directing a new trial if such evidence is held to be inadmissible. The trial judge preferred the evidence of the police witnesses to the evidence of Mr. Graat and Mr. Wilson. In particular, the judge relied on the evidence of Constable McMullen and Sergeant Spoelstra, policemen for 8 and 17 years respectively.",

These offences were alleged to have been committed approximately one month after the appellant's sixteenth birthday. 3.The appellant elected trial by a judge without a jury on all four charges and waived his right to a preliminary inquiry. He subsequently entered pleas of guilty to all counts in the indictment. O Hearn Co. Ct. J. of the County Court Judge's Criminal Court for District No. 1, Nova Scotia, requested a pre‐sentence report and adjourned the matter of sentence. 4.Just before the sentence hearing on November 4, 1983, defence counsel was informed, for the first time, that the Crown might bring a dangerous offender application under Part XXI of theCode. At the commencement of the hearing, the Crown requested and was granted an adjournment to permit it to consider bringing such an application. The application was subsequently made. On November 8, 1983, consent to the application was obtained from the Deputy Attorney General of Nova Scotia, as required by s. 689(1)(a) of theCode. 5.At the commencement of the hearing of the application on December 14, 1983, an agreed upon statement of facts was read into the record. Evidence, including expert psychiatric testimony, was tendered on behalf of both the Crown and the appellant. 6.Though O Hearn Co. Ct. J. had at the outset warned the Crown attorney that he would have an \"uphill fight\" owing to the age of the appellant, the judge in the end found, on the basis of medical and other evidence presented to him, that it had been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant qualified as a dangerous offender under the provisions of theCode. In his view, it had been shown that the appellant had a \"sociopathic personality\" and had so little conscience that it did not govern his actions.",

He belonged, the judge stated, to a class of people who, though mentally able to understand the law and to conform their conduct to its dictates, are so irresponsive to the law that they must be dealt with by extraordinary measures. 7.O Hearn Co. Ct. J. also considered and rejected the appellant's contentions that Part XXI of theCodewas constitutionally invalid as offending against the guarantees embodied inss. 7,9and12of theCharter, and proceeded to sentence the appellant to an indeterminate period of detention in a penitentiary. 8.The appellant's appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, was unanimously dismissed for reasons given by Macdonald J.A. On January 31, 1985, leave to appeal to this Court was granted. 9.The following constitutional questions were stated by the Court on March 26, 1985: 1. Whether the provisions of Part XXI of theCriminal Codeof Canada, dealing with an application for finding, and sentencing, an individual as a dangerous offender, in whole or in part, infringe or deny the rights guaranteed by ss. 7, 9, 11 and/or 12 of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? 2. If so, then are the provisions of Part XXI of theCriminal Code, in whole or in part, justified on the basis ofs. 1of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsand therefore not inconsistent with theConstitution Act, 1982? 10.The appellant also argued that his rights unders. 7of theCharterwere violated by the Crown's failure to give him notice, before his election of a mode of trial and the entry of his plea, that it intended to bring, or contemplated bringing, a \"dangerous offender\" application under Part XXI of theCode. 11.The Attorneys General of Canada, Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan intervened in support of the constitutional validity of Part XXI.

At the sentencing hearing, the Crown asked that the court impose a greater punishment because of previous convictions and established that notice had been given to the accused prior to his plea in compliance withs. 740of theCriminal Codewhich requires that in order to impose a greater punishment the court must be satisfied that the defendant, before making his plea, was notified that, upon conviction, a greater punishment would be sought. 3.As actual proof of the convictions, the Crown simply produced a document entitled \"Certified Extract of British Columbia Driving Record\" pursuant to s. 75 of theMotor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288 (as amended by S.B.C. 1982, c. 36, s. 16).

The defence conceded at trial that the shooting took place in a van and that the only occupants of the van at the time of the shooting were the victim, Mr. Illes and Derrick Madinsky. All three individuals were involved in the drug trade. Mr. Madinsky agreed to testify for the Crown at Mr. Illes's trial in exchange for immunity and witness protection. Mr. Madinsky admitted that he and another drug associate, Garry Favell, disposed of the deceased's body but testified that Mr. Illes was the shooter. Mr. Illes did not testify but took the position at trial that Mr. Madinsky was the shooter. [45]A significant feature of this case is that the victim's head was severed, kept in a plastic bucket and moved from place to place until it was buried several days later, separate from the rest of the body. Melanie Ovalle, a friend of Mr. Illes's then girlfriend and later wife, testified that Mr. Illes put the bucket with the severed head in her garage for a day before moving it to another location. When she asked why the victim was dead, Mr. Illes said he had to be dealt with because he was taking some of the cocaine from deliveries to feed his own habit. Mr. Illes had therefore shot him. In his account of the events, Mr. Madinsky also described the extent and nature of his own connection with the bucket containing the severed head. In essence, he denied ever having seen the bucket at his own apartment, but admitted his involvement in disposing of the remains. His testimony on this point acquires greater significance in the context of the fresh evidence application, and I will therefore review it in more detail later in these reasons. [46]Mr. Illes was arrested based on information Ms. Ovalle gave to the police. While in custody, Mr. Illes wrote several letters to his friends. The letters were introduced in evidence by the Crown and their contents are the subject matter of the impugned jury instruction on out-of-court statements.

This plan was revealed by one of the letters — not intended to be discovered by the police — in which Mr. Illes gave his girlfriend instructions on how to engineer the discovery of the fake letters by the police. The Crown relied on the fabrication of the letters as post-offence conduct tending to prove guilt. Although admitting that the letters were a ruse, the defence argued that the expressions of innocence contained in the letters were nonetheless truthful. 2.1The Jury Instructions [48]At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge gave a strongVetrovecwarning in connection with Mr. Madinsky's testimony . She explained that Mr. Madinsky was an accomplice by virtue of his role in disposing of the victim's body, and that he had been granted immunity in exchange for testifying at Mr. Illes's trial. She also noted that Mr. Madinsky admitted to committing perjury at the preliminary hearing and to lying to both the police and the prosecution. The trial judge told the jury that, given the many reasons for doubting Mr. Madinsky's veracity as a witness, it would be dangerous to rely on his evidence in the absence of some confirmation. Mr. Illes argued in the Court of Appeal, among other things, that the trial judge had erred by pointing out an excessive number of examples of evidence capable of supporting Mr. Madinsky's testimony. The court unanimously rejected this ground of appeal, and the correctness of theVetrovecinstruction is no longer in issue. As it relates to jury instructions, the appeal before this Court is only concerned with the trial judge's instruction to the jury on the weight they may give to the statements in Mr. Illes's letters. [49]As stated earlier, the Crown relied on the fabrication of the letters as post‐offence conduct from which guilt could be inferred.

They hid the marijuana in three trunks at a \"stash\". Some time later he left to attend his brother's funeral on Vancouver Island leaving his wife behind. When he returned, his wife was missing, as were her wallet and some cheques. The footprints of himself and his wife and those of at least one other person could be seen in the snow leading to the location of the stash. Two of the trunks and all of the marijuana were gone. [6]When the police searched the farm, it appeared that a large truck or vehicle had driven up the driveway, but no distinctive tire pattern imprints could be identified. There was no sign of a struggle or blood at the farmhouse or at the stash. An extensive search of the farm by a tracking dog failed to locate the victim's body. [7]The police learned from Bill Wall, the brother of a major Skolos customer, that he might have told the appellant about the arrival of the shipment. The appellant had a substantial record as a drug dealer and an enforcer. The police interviewed the appellant and intercepted his private communications. The appellant denied knowing of the shipment. He admitted having been to the farm on earlier occasions but denied going there around the time when the victim disappeared. [8]Over a period of several months, the appellant gave information and alibis to the police that he later admitted were false. However, on January 19, 2000, on the eve of trial, the appellant entered into a Limited Immunity Agreement with the police. In it he promised to cooperate fully with the investigation and to show police the location of the victim's body, which he said he had buried in order to assist Bill Wall who was the \"real\" murderer. In return, the Crown agreed that the appellant would not be charged with first degree murder in connection with the death. The body was never found, despite the instructions given by the appellant and extensive police searching. Bill Wall denied any involvement. The Crown continued with the first degree murder charge.

He claimed to have met Bill Wall by coincidence on November 23, who told him that the plan was \"a go\" that night. Wall told him the marijuana had arrived at the Skolos farm and that he and an associate were going to go and get it. The appellant was not going to participate in the rip-off, according to Wall, but they would all meet together later that night.

According to the appellant, Wall had told him the gun went off accidentally as he and the victim were walking back to the house from the stash but that he \"just kept shooting her\" and \"just lost it\". [11]The appellant testified that he and Wall lifted the trunks of marijuana out of Wall's truck and put them into a shed. The appellant also said he told Wall that he would bury the victim's body in a hole he had already dug for someone else (a target in a different dispute). The appellant later went back and retrieved the trunks after Wall had left. He testified that after burying the victim (noting the blood on the back of her head) he covered over the hole with debris and leaves to make the ground look unaltered. Then he returned to his girlfriend at a motel loaded with the marijuana and cash. [12]Bill Wall testified at length. He denied everything. He said he never discussed ripping off the marijuana shipment at the Skolos farm with the appellant. He had no reason to do so. He had a profitable ongoing business relationship with the victim and her husband.

I do not think the evidence is of great importance because it is not the task of this Court nor, with respect, the task of any appellate court to make an independent judgment as to whether a particular statement is voluntary. If the true rule is, as I conceive it to be, that the voluntary nature of a statement given to a person in authority can only be determined inavoir dire,then it is undisputed that the judge at trial failed to hold avoir dire,though requested to do so. I do not think it can be seriously contended that the statements admitted [Page 944] in evidence without avoirdirewere not of impor­tance on the issue of guilt. The facts are these. The accused was alleged to have been part of a large-scale operation to traffic in hashish. The plan called for the hashish to be cached on the Cape La Have Islands, just off the coast of Nova Scotia, and to be transported by helicopter to an isolated cottage at Beech Hill, on the mainland, for packaging and later resale. On August 21, 1974, one Robson made three trips transporting hashish by helicopter from Cape La Have Islands to the cottage. On the first of the trips, the appellant Erven and one Mayer were passengers. The helicopter picked them up at Crescent Beach, on the mainland, and transported them to the Islands. Upon arrival at the Islands, the appellant and Mayer disappeared for two or three hours, during which time Robson loaded the hashish into the aircraft and made two trips to the cottage, where the hashish was unloaded. After the helicopter had been loaded by Robson for the third and final time, the appellant and Mayer reap­peared and were taken back to Crescent Beach, where they were dropped off. The helicopter con­tinued its flight to the cottage. During the flights, the hashish was packed in large wrapped bags and transported in the luggage compartment of the aircraft, out of sight of pilot and passengers. There is no direct evidence that the appellant was aware of the nature of the cargo. Immediately after the appellant and Mayer returned to Crescent Beach, they were confronted by two uniformed R.C.M.P. officers, Botham and Gaudet, who began asking questions.",

In response, Mayer indicated that he and the appellant were involved in a Search and Rescue operation, as well as collecting soil samples from the Cape La Have area. In reply to a question by Constable Botham, the appellant acknowledged that he was engaged in the same operations. He gave the same address in Vancouver, British Columbia, as Mayer. The appellant and Mayer were later picked up at the beach by a red Maverick automobile, driven to the beach by a Miss Hale, but driven, on leaving, by the appellant. The trial judge found, as a fact, that the red Maverick was a rented vehicle in the same [Page 945] of one of the persons involved in the narcotics operation. The appellant and the others were arrested shortly after leaving the beach. During the time the appellant and several co-accused were in cus­tody, they were interviewed on August 27, 1974 by two officers, Berry and Melbourne. According to Constable Melbourne, \"as a result of conversation with the accused and with some of the co-accused,\" he and Constable Berry went to the cottage at Beech Hill and removed some articles of clothing and toiletries. They brought these articles to the jail and gave various of them to the accused, \"because he requested them.\" The importance of this evidence to the trial judge is expressed in the following passage from his judgment: ..it seems to me that the acceptance by the accused of these three items of clothing is some evidence which is unexplained and which connected the accused with the whole operation. It is perhaps convenient to point out, at this point, that a very large quantity of cannabis resin, some seventeen hundred, sixty-five and a quarter pounds was found in eighty-nine packages in the cabin at Beech Hill from which the clothes were removed. Indeed, it was at this point the general evidence indicates that the resin was being packaged by two persons who are not before me in this trial. The accused was tried without a jury in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court, on a charge of unlawfully having in his possession cannabis resin, for the purposes of trafficking.",

The interview on Crescent Beach when the accused and Mayer were confronted by two uniformed police officers, Botham and Gaudet, was admitted into evidence by the trial judge without avoir dire,as I have indicated, despite the objection of defence counsel. Constable Botham was the only officer to testify. The accused did not testify. According to Constable Botham, he and Constable Gaudet did not, at that point, know the nature of the operation they had discovered. However, they were, he testified, investigating complaints from a person who was very suspicious of what was going on. The trial judge regarded the affirmative response of the appellant to Constable Botham's question as an adoption by the appellant of May­er's false story that the appellant and Mayer, and [Page 946] the helicopter, were just engaged in collecting soil samples. Although the exact words were not disclosed, the fact of the conversations on August 27, 1974, respecting the clothing and the result of those conversations, was also admitted without avoir dire,again over the objection of defence counsel. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The Appellate Division dismissed the appeal. Three main grounds of appeal were advanced in the Appellate Division. It was contended that the trial judge erred in admitting without avoir direthe statements made by the appellant to the police on August 21 and August 27, 1974, and that the judge erred in the wrongful use of hearsay evidence. On this last point, Mackeigan C.J.N.S. said: Dealing first with the last, I respectfully think the learned judge erred in admitting and referring in his decision to hearsay evidence by a police constable that the red Maverick car driven from the beach by the appellant was rented, and even more seriously erred in saying in his decision, with no evidence to support it, that the vehicle had been rented 'in the name of one of the persons involved in the series of circumstances to which I have related.' The judge did not specify which of Carr, Robson, Mayer or Miss Hale had, as he understood, rented the car.",

The wrongfully imputed rental of the car does not constitute a vital or indispensable link between the appellant and Carr or Robson.

    "text": "Parmjeet K. Sidhu and Gurmail Sidhu, to whom she had been recently married, were killed in a violent explosion at approximately 10.00 a.m. on October 23, 1972, in a basement suite occupied by them in the City of New Westminster. The mys­tery surrounding their deaths remained unsolved until January 1976, when information obtained by the police resulted in the arrest of Lewis, and subsequently, the arrest of his co-accused, Tatlay. A cardboard box indicating that it had con­tained a \"Sunbeam K22\" electric kettle was found at the scene of the explosion. The debris contained metal fragments with nitrate residue. A nitrate based explosive called \"forcite\" was used at the Craigmont mine near Merritt, British Columbia, where both Tatlay and Lewis were employed. In common with most other mine employees, both had ready access to such explosives. Lewis was employed at the mine as,inter alia, a\"blaster\" and possessed a \"blasting certificate\". About forty per cent of the mine employees had blasting certificates. On October 24, 1972, on the floor of the bed-room closet of the suite a brown paper wrapping [Page 825] was located bearing the address of the two deceased, a return address in Kamloops, British Columbia, (which turned out to be fictitious) and the word \"Fragile\" printed three times. The hand-writing was identified as that of Lewis. The postal inscription indicated that the parcel had been sent in the mail from Kamloops on October 19, 1972. The parcel was delivered by a postal courier on October 23, 1972. At all material times, Tatlay and Lewis were residents of Merritt, some sixty miles from Kamloops. Parmjeet had lived with her father, Santa Tatlay, in Merritt until April 1972. At that point, having just turned eighteen, she went with Gur­mail to Alberta, where parental consent was not required, and there married him. Some time in the late spring or summer of 1972, Tatlay approached James A. Mountain and asked for his assistance in finding someone to kill Gurmail because Tatlay's daughter had run away with Gurmail and Tatlay did not approve. Mountain refused. During the same period, Tatlay approached William J. Todd, expressing concern that his daughter had married a \"commoner\" and disgraced the family. He said that the commoner would have to die and offered Todd $2,000 to kill Gurmail. Todd also refused.",

Todd also refused. There was no evidence at trial to indicate that Lewis was aware of Tatlay's family problems or of Tatlay's approaches to Mountain and Todd. The case for the Crown, as it related to Lewis, turned largely upon the testimony of one Brabant, a chronic alcoholic and petty criminal of some standing. Lewis and Brabant were friends They had known each other for about eight years. They lived near each other in Merritt, and had made trips together to other parts of Canada. On October 17, 1972, Lewis and Brabant went to Kamloops, Brabant wishing to purchase a pair of reading glasses, and Lewis \"to buy something, a present or something.\" In Kamloops the two men went to a store, separated, and met again at the cashier's counter. On the counter in front of Lewis was a box similar in size to the one found in Parmjeet's suite following her death. The lid was [Page 826] open and according to Brabant the box contained a \"round\" metal object which was \"kind of shiny, shiny colour ... chrome or nickel.\" Two days later, on October 19, 1972, Lewis again invited Brabant to accompany him to Kamloops. Lewis said that he had to \"mail a parcel\". Resting in the back seat of the car during the trip was a parcel similar in size to the box containing the purchase made by Lewis on October 17. The parcel was enclosed in brown paper of a kind similar to the wrapper found in the New Westminster suite after the explosion. Lewis and Brabant drank beer on the way to Kamloops and arrived there before noon. Lewis parked the car close by the local post office. According to Brabant, he told Brabant that he had to get an address out of the 'phone book. Lewis left the car and went into a nearby telephone booth where, observed by Brabant, he examined the tele­phone book and wrote something down. Shortly thereafter Lewis returned to the car and, in the presence of Brabant, took the parcel out of the back seat and placed it on his lap.",

He then either wrote something on the parcel or wrote something on a piece of paper using the parcel for support. Lewis then took the parcel from the car and walked with it to the post office. Upon his return, he said \"everything's set, let's go.\" During the balance of the day the two men drank and, accord­ing to Lewis, bought machinery parts. In his tes­timony before the jury, it might be said, Lewis acknowledged and accepted substantially the sequence of events on October 17 and October 19 recounted by Brabant. During the drive back to Merritt on October 19, according to Brabant, Lewis said to him \"Art, you listen to the radio in the morning ... you're going to hear something about a boom or a blast or whatever it is.\" Brabant was admittedly \"drunk\" at the time. He did, however, listen to the radio as suggested and a couple of days later heard of the explosion in New Westminster. Brabant \"wrote down the date I had been in Kamloops and what I [Page 827] had done in Kamloops ... on a piece of receipt or invoice or paper I got from—from the place I got the part from.\" The reason for his concern was clearly expressed in these words: In case something turned up and I was there when the thing was bought and I was there when the thing was mailed so I figured I was going to be in hot soup later with that so I marked it down to make sure I remember what I did. Lewis testified in his own defence. He conceded that he had gone to Kamloops with Brabant on October 17, but said he bought an electric percola­tor as an anniversary present to his wife, their wedding anniversary being October 1, and her birthday November 4. As a favour to Tatlay, whom he knew slightly, he had agreed to mail, from Kamloops, a previously wrapped parcel, the contents of which were described to him simply as a gift.",

He admitted placing on the parcel all of the writing that appeared there, but he did so, he said, at the request of Tatlay who wrote little or no English. Lewis denied that on the second return journey from Kamloops to Merritt he had said anything to Brabant about a boom or blast. Lewis swore that he became aware of the New Westminster occurrence through the local newspa­per. Concerned by the similarity of the names reported to those which he had only shortly before written on the parcel which he had mailed, he went to Brabant for advice. The advice, he said, was not to go to the police for, never having been involved with the police, he would not \"know what to say to them.\" If he went to the authorities \"the East Indians will get you for sure,\" was Brabant's com­ment. In short, said Lewis, he was advised \"to stay away from the police and mind your own business and keep quiet.\" Later, according to Lewis' evidence, he approached Tatlay underground at the mine, and said \"What kind of a mess have you gotten me into? ... I am going to the police.\" Tatlay, accord­ing to Lewis, replied \"If you go to the police I will get you, I will get your wife, and I will get your [Page 828] kids and if I can't do it myself, I will hire it done or I will get it done.\" Lewis discussed the matter no further with anyone until his arrest more than three years later. Lewis gave two written statements to the police. In the first statement, Lewis recounted that he had met Tatlay at the mine, Tatlay had asked him to mail a parcel at Kamloops and Tatlay had given Lewis $2 for postage. The statement continued that several days later Lewis heard around the mine that Tatlay's daughter had been killed, but that he did not connect it in his mind with anything that he, Lewis, had done.",

    "text": "A rather detailed recital of the facts is essential to an understanding of the issues. In June 1975, Brenda Ross was sixteen years of age. On the night of the alleged offence, accompanied by a friend, Anne McGibney, she went to the Waldorf Hotel in the City of Winnipeg to listen to a band and drink beer. A number of members of a motorcycle club known as the Spartans were present at the hotel. The two girls were joined at their table by two members of the club, one Hawryluk and the appel­lant Dunlop, and by a prospective member, one Douglas. During the evening the complainant con­sumed five or six glasses of beer. At about 11:30 p.m. she, riding on the back of Douglas' motorcy­cle, and Anne McGibney, riding on the back of Hawryluk's motorcycle, went briefly to the Balmoral Hotel. Leaving there, they proceeded on the motorcycles to an isolated area, the site of a former dump, located on Elmwood on the outskirts of Winnipeg. The Elmwood dump was favoured asarendez-vousby motorcyclists because of the hillocks. After arrival, the four sat on the grass and talked for about five minutes, following which McGibney and Hawryluk went for a walk. The complainant and Douglas remained for three or four minutes, then Douglas left to repair his bike, leaving the complainant alone. Lonely, she arose and went looking for McGib­ney and Hawryluk. At this moment four men in black leather jackets bearing the Spartan emblem arrived on motorcycles. They approached the com­plainant, picked her up by the arms and legs, carried her to a nearby area bordering a creek and threw her on the ground. By this time, quite a few other men, similarly dressed, arrived. The complai­nant's clothes were torn from her, and each of the men, about eighteen in number, had intercourse with her while she was being held by two of the others. On direct examination the complainant was asked whether she was able to recognize any of the men who had had intercourse, to which she replied \"Yes, those two right there\", looking at the appel­lants Dunlop and Sylvester. The night was very dark, but the complainant explained that after the men had laid her down a bonfire had been lighted, and she could see by the light of the fire.",

At one [Page 887] point she was threatened with a knife. There are more unpleasant details, but they need not be here recounted. The following day the complainant picked Dunlop from a police lineup as one of the men who had attacked her. Sylvester was identified in a second lineup later the same day. Asked by Crown counsel what it was about them that made it possible for her to recall the two men so clearly, the complainant answered \"Well, not really that much, but I seen their faces as they were getting on top of me.\" Later, she testified that she remem­bered very clearly the two accused, and that she was positive in her identification. She conceded on cross-examination that neither of the two accused was among the four men who first approached her, nor had either of them pinned her arms or pro­duced a knife. Her sole testimony implicating the two accused was to the effect that each of them had performed the physical act of intercourse with her during the course of the sexual attack. The case for the Crown was put forward on that footing. Each of the accused gave evidence. Dunlop testified that he had attended a meeting of the Spartan Motorcycle Club at the Elmwood dump early in the evening in question, at which time Douglas had been introduced as a prospective member. Later, according to his evidence, Dunlop went to the Waldorf Hotel, joined the two girls at a table for a while, and then played pool until he left the hotel at about 1:00 a.m. He explained that Sylvester had been asked to bring beer to the dump for a party. He, Dunlop, accompanied Sylv­ester in the latter's car to the Vibrations disco­theque, where they remained about half-an-hour and then proceeded to the dump, arriving at 2:15 a.m. Upon arrival, he said, he and Sylvester \"grabbed the beer which was four cases,\" walked over to the top of a knoll and set down the beer. Douglas was there. He told Sylvester that everyone was angry over the delay in delivering the [Page 888] beer.",

Dunlop walked to the other side of the knoll and noticed a few people down near the creek bed about twenty-five yards distant. Some of them displayed their ire at the delay in fetching the beer, by yelling at Dunlop and Sylvester. Dunlop saw a female having intercourse; with whom, he could not say, but he believed the person to be a Spartan. After three minutes he and Sylvester left. Dunlop denied having intercourse with Brenda Ross, or in any way assisting anyone else to have intercourse with her. Sylvester's evidence was to the same effect as that of Dunlop. The issue for the jury was a simple one-did the two accused have intercourse with Brenda Ross? She said that they had, and they denied it. The issue was well formulated by the trial judge just before the conclusion of his summing up, in these words: If you accept the evidence of Brenda Ross, and if after weighing all the evidence you come to the conclu­sion that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the two accused did have sexual intercourse with Brenda Ross without her consent, then you may find them both guilty as charged. If, on the other hand you have reasonable doubt that either one or both accused participated in this way, then you must give that particular accused the benefit of that reasonable doubt and acquit the accused on the charge. That is all the case was about. The judge chose, however, to instruct the jury upon parties to an offence under s. 21 of theCode,and it is in this respect that the convictions are challenged. The general effect of s. 21 is to make equally culpable (i) the person who actually commits the offence, (ii) any person who aids or abets in committing the offence, and (iii) persons who form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose leading to the commission of the offence.",

On August 21, 1981, one Donald Kerr was brought to the R.C.M.P. detachment in Yorkton, Saskatch‐ ewan for a breathalyzer test. Kerr was taken into a room where he met the appellant. The appellant started to question Kerr concerning the incident giving rise to his arrest. He asked Kerr who was driving the car at the time. Kerr indicated that his sister was driving. The appellant suspected he was lying. He repeated the question a couple of times, receiving the same response each time. The appellant then grabbed Kerr, who was seated in a chair at the time, by the throat and pushed him against a wall. The grab around the throat was sufficient to cause a choking sensation to Kerr. After a few seconds the appellant questioned Kerr again as to who was driving the car. Kerr continued to maintain that his sister was driving. The appellant slapped Kerr across the face with his open hand and repeated the question. Kerr gave the same answer. However, after three or four slaps Kerr admitted that he had been driving the car. At no time did Kerr respond physically to the appellant's slaps. The defence has admitted, on these facts, that the appellant committed a common assault as defined in theCriminal Code. As a result of the assault Kerr suffered a sore throat, a ringing in his ears, and several minor marks on his face. Two charges were laid following this incident.

At Paré's suggestion the two went swimming. After about fifteen minutes in the pool Paré offered to take Duranleau to look at some used cars. The offer was only a pretence. Paré's real motive was to get Duranleau alone in order to have sexual relations with him. 4.After changing, Paré and Duranleau went to a parking lot where they looked at some used cars. Near the parking lot was a bridge that crossed the St. Charles River. Paré lured Duranleau under the bridge. Duranleau wanted to leave but Paré told him not to and held him by the arm. Paré sat there for the next ten minutes holding Duranleau by the arm. Then Paré told Duranleau to lie on his back and to keep quiet. Paré pulled Duranleau's shorts down and lowered his own pants and underwear. He then lay on top of Duranleau and indecently assaulted him. After ejaculating beside Duranleau's penis, Paré sat up and got dressed. 5.At this point Duranleau told Paré that he intended to tell his mother about the incident. Paré told him that he did not want him to tell his mother and that, if he did, he would kill him. After this exchange of words Paré was certain that the boy would tell his mother as soon as he could. Paré made Duranleau lie on his back. He waited for two minutes with his hand on Duranleau's chest. He then killed Duranleau by strangling him with his hands, hitting him on the head several times with an oil filter, and strangling him with a shoe‐lace. 6.The accused was charged as follows: [TRANSLATION] That in Québec City, Quebec, on or around July 13, 1982, he illegally and intentionally killed Steeve Duranleau, thereby committing murder in the first degree contrary to sections 212‐214(5)‐218 of theCriminal Code. At trial the accused admitted all the facts outlined above. On December 7, 1982 the accused was found guilty of first degree murder.

The Committee was composed of the appellant, as chairman, and MacFadden and Simpson who acted primarily as collectors. Two bank accounts were opened by the Committee for the purpose of receiving financial contributions. The accounts were in the name of Cambridge Investments and J. Simpson, in trust. The signing authorities on the Cambridge account were Simpson and MacFadden and, on the other, Simpson and his secretary. Monies collected or received were deposited to these accounts and then disbursed to several trust funds which had been set up over the years for the purposes of the Nova Scotia liberal party, to various individuals and the Nova Scotia Liberal Association. The common trustee of all the trust funds was the appellant. 54.According to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which on this point is not challenged, the evidence, particularly documentary evidence, showed clearly that the appellant and his co‐accused were at all times aware of the flow of cash through both bank accounts. Meticulous accounting records were kept with respect to the two accounts and none of the monies disbursed from the accounts or the various trust funds was expended by the appellant or his two co‐accused for their own use or benefit. The evidence also revealed a close relationship between the members of the Committee, as well as a close connection between the committee members and government officials from whom they received information relating to such matters as the identity of those who were doing business with the Government of Nova Scotia. 55.In October of 1970, the liberal party defeated the then Government of Nova Scotia in a general election and formed the new government which held power until 1978. During the period from 1970 to 1978, the Committee collected contributions amounting in total to $3,836,468.13, of which $2,770,773.52 was deposited in one bank account and $1,065,694.61 in the other. A police investigation commenced in the autumn of 1978 resulted in the seizure of many documents from government departments and agencies and also from several wineries, distilleries and other corporations.",

    "text": "A police investigation commenced in the autumn of 1978 resulted in the seizure of many documents from government departments and agencies and also from several wineries, distilleries and other corporations. The evidence revealed that the contributions made by liquor and wine companies dealing with the government were based on a fixed amount per case of products sold to the Government. Other companies doing business with the government paid a percentage of monies they received from government work which ranged from three to five per cent. 56.The theory of the Crown was that the monies contributed to the Committee were not, in fact, bona fide political contributions but were payments made by them to ensure the continuation of their business relationship with the Government. To secure these contributions, the appellant and his two accused, out of their desire to support the liberal party in Nova Scotia, agreed among themselves to \"peddle their influence with the Government\" to the various companies doing business with the Government. The appellant defended on the basis that his character and reputation refuted the charge against him. It was said that the whole case for the Crown was an attempt to involve the appellant in conduct of the co‐accused Simpson in which he was in no way involved. The appellant did not contend before the Court of Appeal, nor does he in this Court, that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. He raised four grounds of appeal before the Court of Appeal and raised the same grounds in this Court. They are set out hereunder: 1. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the learned Trial Judge's examination under oath of members of the jury panel on April 5, 1983 in the absence of the appellant (and his counsel) did not vitiate the appellant's trial. 2. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the Nova Scotia Liberal Association is a \"person\" within the meaning ofSection 110(1)(d) of theCriminal Code of Canada. 3.",

The information reads as follows: I, Norm Maleng, Prosecuting Attorney for King County in the name and by the authority of the state of Washington, by this Information do accuse Melford Keith Johnson, of the crime of theft in the second degree, committed as follows: That the defendant Melford Keith Johnson, in King County, Washington, on or about February 20, 1979, with intent to deprive another of property to wit: a Lowrey Organ, did exert unauthorized control over such property belonging to Mr. and Mrs. George Ford; that the value of such property did exceed $250: Contrary to RCW 9A.56.040(1)(A).020(1)(a), and against the peace and dignity of the state of Washington. The material facts underlying the charge are as follows. In February 1979 a Washington couple, the Fords, placed an advertisement in a Seattle newspaper offering to sell a \"Lowrey\" organ. The respondent Johnson offered to attempt to sell it for them. Johnson and the Fords entered into an agreement giving Johnson possession of the organ for thirty days after which he was to return the organ if it had not been sold. During the thirty‐day period Johnson referred two offers to the Fords; the Fords rejected the offers because they were too low. 10.At the expiry of the thirty‐day period the organ was not returned. The Fords attempted to locate Johnson and the organ but were unsuccessful on both counts. 11.Johnson was arrested in Seattle, Washington, on May 8, 1982. He pleaded guilty to the offence of theft in the second degree and was sentenced to the maximum term of five years' imprisonment. On December 26, 1982 Johnson escaped from prison. He left the State of Washington and came to Canada. At the time of his escape fifty‐two months of his sentence remained to be served. 12.Authorities in the State of Washington commenced proceedings to have Johnson extradited pursuant to the terms of theCanada‐U.S.A. Extradition Treaty,1976. On September 7, 1983, an information was sworn before a Vancouver extradition judge stating that Johnson was a convicted fugitive who had escaped from custody in Washington. The judge issued a warrant for the apprehension of Johnson pursuant to s. 10(1) of theExtradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.",

They have for many years attended Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. Our Lady of Lourdes is one of ninety‐three parishes which make up the Diocese of Antigonish. 4.It has become the custom in this diocese for communion to be received standing by those able to do so. This custom is a relatively recent development. The previous practice had been for communion to be received kneeling. This change has been accepted and approved by the Bishop responsible for the diocese. 5.Nonetheless, the appellants continued to oppose this change in the liturgy. As a result of their opposition, there has been what has been characterized before us as an ongoing dispute between the appellants on the one hand and the priests and other members of this church, on the other hand. 6.To aid in the resolution of this dispute, the parish priest and his assistant drew up a directive concerning the procedures to be followed during mass. This directive dealt in particular with the manner in which communion was to be administered and received. This directive was regularly read during services to the parishioners prior to the day of the alleged offence. 7.On that day as well, this directive was read to the assembled congregation, among whom were then present most, if not all, of the appellants. The directive was again read shortly before communion was administered by which time all appellants were present. 8.When the point in the mass had been reached when communion was to be taken, the appellants, with the other members of the congregation who desired to receive communion, made their way to the back of the church. From there, two lines formed and made their way down the centre aisle towards the three communion stations at or near the altar. The two lines spread into three as they approached these communion stations. 9.As each accused arrived at a communion station, he or she knelt before the priest. They were each told to stand if they wished to receive communion. After a few seconds, each one stood and, without receiving communion, moved off in an orderly manner to the sides of the church and returned to his or her seat.",

C‐34, which reads: 312.(1) Every one commits an offence who has in his possession any property or thing or any proceeds of any property or thing knowing that all or part of the property or thing or of the proceeds was obtained by or derived directly or indirectly from (a) the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment; . . . 3.Count 6 of the information, the count with which we are in this appeal particularly concerned, reads: count6The informant also says that he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that Barry Graham MOORE, on or about the 27th day of February A.D., 1981, at or near the Town of Williams Lake, County of Cariboo and Province of British Columbia, did UNLAWFULLY have in his possession, automobile parts, the property of Zora Enterprises Ltd. of a value exceeding two hundred dollars, CONTRARY TO THE FORM OF STATUTE IN SUCH CASE MADE AND PROVIDED 4.It will be noted that the information lacks the averment of an essential element of the offence, namely that Moore knew that the property had been obtained from the commission in Canada of an indictable offence. Moore entered a plea of not guilty to the charges against him and elected to be tried by a magistrate without a jury. 5.When the matter came on for trial, the trial judge, Smith Prov. Ct. J., asked defence counsel if he had any submission to make. The judge also asked Crown counsel if he had any comments on the information. Counsel made no comment. The judge then pointed out the defect and asked defence counsel if he had a motion to quash unders. 529of theCriminal Code. Defence counsel promptly argued that the counts disclosed no offence known to law. The trial judge and Crown counsel agreed with that submission. Defence counsel moved that the defective counts be quashed. Crown counsel moved that the pleas be struck to permit the Crown to amend the information pursuant to s. 529.",

Defence counsel then argued that since the counts simply failed to allege an offence, rather than alleging one improperly, it was not possible to amend them at all. Again the judge and Crown counsel agreed with this statement and the judge quashed the defective counts. 6.A new information containing the necessary words omitted from the earlier information was subsequently sworn. When trial on that information began, Moore entered pleas ofautrefois acquiton the possession counts. The second trial judge, Barnett Prov. Ct. J., refused the special pleas because he accepted the Crown's submission that the counts in the first information had been \"hopelessly bad\". He ruled that since there had never been any allegation of criminal misconduct, the appellant had never been in peril of conviction. The first essential for a special plea ofautrefois acquitwas not present and the plea was not available. Moore then entered pleas of not guilty to the two charges. He was convicted on count 6.

He obtained from an employee of the store, who later gave evidence for the Crown at his trial, information as to the layout and operation of the store, including the location of the safe, and the name and identity of the head cashier who had a key to the safe. The plan was that the head cashier would be kidnapped in the store's parking lot in the evening after store‐closing. She would then be forced to re‐enter the store and open the safe. On December 19, 1982, the head cashier on opening her car door saw a masked man hiding in the back seat of her car. She slammed the door shut and ran in one direction. The masked man ran in another direction and the store remained secure. No arrests were made. 4.In June, 1983, the police were investigating Whiteman and others, not including the appellants, concerning several property offences not connected with charges in the case at bar. For this purpose on June 29, 1983, they applied for and were granted by Waite J., of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, a judicial authorization, valid for 60 days, which empowered designated persons to intercept telecommunications and oral communications as set out in the authorization: . . . and for such purpose to install, monitor, or remove any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device including where necessary, entering those places set out in Paragraphs 3 and 4 herein that may be required to implement this Authorization.

Neither of the appellants was named in the authorization. Paragraphs 3 and 4 also authorized the police to intercept private communications of the four named individuals, as well as those of unknown persons: . . . at any other place, stationary or mobile, in the Province of Alberta, that the known persons are using or attending or can be reasonably expected to use or attend.",

The Crown claimed that Whiteman and his girlfriend, the appellant Vanweenan, in pursuit of this scheme placed the head cashier under surveillance by following her in Whiteman's truck. While Whiteman and Vanweenan were following and observing the cashier, the police were following and observing Whiteman and Vanweenan. To further the investigation relating to the robbery of the supermarket, the police concluded that they might procure evidence by placing a listening device in Whiteman's truck. On July 7, 1983, acting under the authorization which had been granted earlier, the police were able to place surreptitiously a short‐range listening device in Whiteman's truck. It was wired to the truck's battery which provided power for its transmitter. 6.At trial, the technician who installed the device in the truck said that although the device drew power from the battery, it had no negative effect upon the battery because once the vehicle started it would recharge and restore any lost power. He acknowledged that in theory the device could drain all power from the battery, rendering it wholly inoperative, but this would occur only if it were left in the vehicle and the vehicle itself was not started for thirty consecutive days. It was not disputed that in this case the device caused no injury to vehicle or battery. 7.Surveillance was maintained until the end of July 1983 when the plan to rob the supermarket was again abandoned.",

The answer to this concern is that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. If facts which are essential to a finding of guilt are still doubtful notwithstanding the support of other facts, this will produce a doubt in the mind of the jury that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 40.I conclude from the foregoing that the facts are for the jury to determine subject to an instruction by the trial judge as to the law. While the charge may and often does include many helpful tips on the weighing of evidence such as observing demeanour, taking into the account the interest of the witness and so forth, the law lays down only one basic requirement: during the process of deliberation the jury or other trier of fact must consider the evidence as a whole and determine whether guilt is established by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. This of necessity requires that each element of the offence or issue be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Beyond this injunction it is for the trier of fact to determine how to proceed. To intrude in this area is, as pointed out by North P., an intrusion into the province of the jury. 41.The reason we have juries is so that lay persons and not lawyers decide the facts. To inject into the process artificial legal rules with respect to the natural human activity of deliberation and decision would tend to detract from the value of the jury system. Accordingly, it is wrong for a trial judge to lay down additional rules for the weighing of the evidence. Indeed, it is unwise to attempt to elaborate on the basic requirement referred to above. I would make two exceptions. The jury should be told that the facts are not to be examined separately and in isolation with reference to the criminal standard. This instruction is a necessary corollary to the basic rule referred to above.",

There is a danger in such a situation that a jury might conclude that it is simply a matter as to which side they believe. The suggested charge alerts them to the fact that, if the defence evidence leaves them in a state of doubt after considering it in the context of the whole of the evidence, then they are to acquit. 43.Consequently, even if the appellant is correct in his interpretation of the charge to the jury, there was misdirection‐‐although not as serious as the misdirection which I have found occurred.",

The latter Act, by s. 2, provides that a person in lawful custody may be subjected to certain processes of identification, the best known today, of course, being fingerprinting, which has been sanctioned by the Governor in Council pursuant to this provision; see SOR/48‐412. Section 2 reads as follows: 2. (1) Any person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable offence, or who has been apprehended under theExtradition Actor theFugitive Offenders Act, may be subjected, by or under the direction of those in whose custody he is, to the measurements, processes and operations practised under the system for the identification of criminals commonly known as the Bertillon Signaletic System, or to any measurements, processes or operations sanctioned by the Governor in Council having the like object in view. (2) Such force may be used as is necessary to the effectual carrying out and application of such measurements, processes and operations. (3) The signaletic cards and other results thereof may be published for the purpose of affording information to officers and others engaged in the execution or administration of the law. A person to whom an appearance notice is given is, by s. 453.3(3) of theCriminal Codedeemed to be a person in lawful custody for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act. Section 453.3(3) at the relevant time read as follows: 453.3... (3) An appearance notice or promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an officer in charge may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated therein for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act, and a person so appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in lawful custody charged with an indictable offence.",

He is also guilty of an offence under s. 133(5) of theCode. 4.In December, 1982, the respondent, Higgins, was charged with defrauding Soo Security Motorways of more than $200 contrary tos. 338(1)of theCriminal Code. He was served with a summons requiring him to attend in court and to appear at R.C.M.P. offices \"for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act\". By section 455.5(5) of theCode, a person so summoned is also deemed to be a person in lawful custody for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act. Section 455.5(5) reads: 455.5... (5) A summons may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated therein for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act, and a person so appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in lawful custody charged with an indictable offence. A person who fails to comply with such a summons is also subject to arrest by warrant (s. 455.6) and is guilty of an offence (s. 133(4)). 5.Neither Beare nor Higgins attended at the R.C.M.P. offices as required. Both challenged the requirement that they appear for fingerprinting as being a violation of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On March 14, 1983, Rutherford J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan dismissed Beare's application without recorded reasons. On April 4, 1983, Higgins' application was also dismissed by Maurice J. who gave reasons. 6.Higgins' application was for relief pursuant to theCharter, particularly ss. 8, 11(d),24(1)and pursuant tos. 52(1)of theConstitution Act, 1982. Though Maurice J. thought the application contained procedural defects, he nonetheless proceeded to examine the merits of the case and concluded that theIdentification of Criminals Actdid not contravene ss. 8 and 11(d) and even if it did, the Act would be saved bys. 1of theCharter. 7.Both respondents appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.

    "text": "The appeals were heard together. Both argued that a requirement subjecting an accused to fingerprinting under theIdentification of Criminals Actbefore conviction for an indictable offence infringed upon his rights as guaranteed by theCharter. Though reliance was placed onss. 7,8,9,10,11(c)and (d) of theCharter, the court restricted its considerations to s. 7. 8.By judgment dated April 14, 1987, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the appeals (1987), 56 Sask. R. 173, [1987] 4 W.W.R. 309, 57 C.R. (3d) 193 (hereinafter cited from (1987), 56 Sask. R. 173), and ruled that to the extent that they provide for the fingerprinting of a person charged with but not convicted of an indictable offence, s. 2 of theIdentification of Criminals Actand ss. 453.3(3) and 455.5(5) of theCriminal Codeviolates. 7of theCharterand are of no force and effect. The violation did not constitute a reasonable limit within the meaning ofs. 1of theCharter. Separate judgments were given by Bayda C.J.S. (Brownridge J.A. concurring) and Cameron J.A. 9.In Bayda C.J.S.'s view, the concept \"life, liberty and security of the person\" refers not only to physical but to mental integrity. The latter, he observed, could be subsumed in the phrase \"the dignity and worth of the person.\" As he saw it, subjecting a person to fingerprinting prior to conviction violates the elements of dignity and self‐respect inherent ins. 7of theCharter. He states at p. 182: It is common knowledge that fingerprinting is not carried out universally but only in respect of those thought to have engaged in criminal activity ... that in the minds of the public fingerprinting is associated with criminals and criminal activity: to be fingerprinted is to be treated like a criminal. It is one thing, however, to have been found by a court to be a criminal and then to be treated like one. It is quite another not to have been so found (particularly when the person has an honest belief in his innocence) and to be treated like one. The humiliation is exacerbated when the person realizes that the fingerprints remain as a permanent record, a permanent stigma, notwithstanding the withdrawal or the dismissal of the charge.",

That such a person's reputation, self‐respect or dignity may suffer in the process is patent. 10.Bayda C.J.S. was of the opinion that this violation was not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, given the absence of safeguards in s. 2 of the Act to prevent injury to those whom there is no need to identify or those who fall subject to the Act but are not criminals. He noted that the person in authority who has the power to require the fingerprinting need not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused had committed the offence. That person could be arbitrary and capricious. In Bayda C.J.S.'s view the belief of the person who laid the charge is irrelevant. The final indignity, he noted, is the lack of any requirement to destroy the fingerprints if the accused is discharged. He referred to the British statute, thePolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(U.K.), 1984, c. 60, that incorporates such safeguards. 11.Bayda C.J.S. then went on to consider whether the legislation might be saved unders. 1of theCharterand concluded that it could not. 12.Cameron J.A. arrived at the same conclusion by a somewhat different route.

He, too, noted that there are no provisions governing the ultimate disposition of the fingerprints in the event of a withdrawal of the charge, a stay or an acquittal. 14.Cameron J.A. considered that the impugned provisions of the Act and of theCriminal Codedeprive the person affected thereby of liberty and security of the person. The person is required by law to surrender himself into the custody of the authorities, or face arrest and prosecution, and must submit to the bodily intrusions sanctioned by s. 2 of the Act.

The evidence disclosed that Schwartz had bought the two handguns in 1978 from one of his employees, Horst Schimiczek, who had acquired the .38 Special in Texas and the .44 Magnum in North Dakota. Schimiczek had moved to Winnipeg, duly registered the two weapons, and then sold the guns to Schwartz. He gave Schwartz the registration papers, in Schimiczek's name. Later, an application in Schwartz's name for a firearms acquisition certificate, the necessary first step to obtain a registration certificate, was received by the Firearms Section of the City of Winnipeg Police Department. At the time, the Firearms Section was under control of Staff Sergeant Gordon Pilcher, who reviewed the application and determined that a notice of intention to refuse a firearms acquisition certificate should be sent to Schwartz. A notice to this effect was delivered to Schwartz by double registered mail. 3.Approximately nine months after the notice was mailed, members of the Winnipeg Police Department executed a search of Schwartz's home, and located and confiscated a .44 Magnum and a .38 Special. 4.Schwartz proceeded to trial before Allen Prov. Ct. J. and was convicted on both charges. He was fined $50 on each charge. On appeal, Barkman Co. Ct. J. allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Crown then appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal (Hall J.A., Matas J.A. concurring, and Huband J.A. dissenting in part). The acquittals were set aside and convictions restored.

Shortly after midnight, on the morning of October 27, 1982, the appellant broke into the complainant's apartment and assaulted her. Later, he slashed his own throat. He and the complainant were treated for relatively minor injuries and released from hospital. The appellant was thereupon charged with the offence which is the subject of this appeal, causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 306(1)(b) of theCode. While certain factual details are in issue, there was no dispute that the appellant did break into the complainant's home and did assault her. 4.The only defence advanced was lack of intent due to the appellant's voluntary consumption of alcohol. There was considerable evidence from both Crown and defence witnesses that the appellant was very drunk and acting very much out of character when he broke the window on the front door, unlocked it and forced his way into the apartment. The appellant testified he had not eaten all day, he had slept little in the previous four days, and he had consumed a great deal of alcohol between 8:00 p.m. on October 26th and 12:30 a.m. on October 27th. The defence also led expert psychiatric evidence to establish the effect of the appellant's consumption of alcohol on his mental processes considering the amount he had imbibed, his lack of sleep, and failure to eat that day.",

That subsection provides that everyone who, in committing a sexual assault, causes bodily harm to the complainant is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for fourteen years. 3.The facts may be briefly stated. 4.The complainant, eighteen years of age at the relevant time, visited the appellant, twenty‐four years old. The appellant went out to dinner and to a bar with some friends while the complainant stayed behind in his apartment. Later that night the group returned to the flat. The friends departed, leaving the appellant and the complainant alone together. 5.The complainant testified that she had complied with the appellant's request to remain in the apartment after the friends' departure, both because she was not feeling well and because it was the first Christmas since the death of her father. She and the appellant, who had been a good friend of her late father, were going to talk about him. 6.The two lay down on the couch together and began talking. The complainant testified that she was then forced to have sexual intercourse without her consent and was subjected to serious bodily injury at the hands of the appellant. There was evidence that the appellant had punched the complainant twice with a closed fist, once above the eye, causing the eyelid to bleed profusely, and that he had threatened to kill her. There was evidence of a blood‐stained towel and pillow case concealed in the toilet tank of the appellant's apartment. Counsel for the appellant admitted that intercourse had taken place. 7.The complainant testified that the appellant had been drinking but was able to walk, to see everything, to talk clearly, and to put albums on the record player. One of the friends of the appellant testified that the appellant had been drinking on the night in question and, though he became rowdy, he was walking straight and talking. 8.When the police arrived at the appellant's apartment, he was awakened from a deep sleep and seemed to be suffering somewhat from his drinking. The appellant stated that his drunkenness caused the attack on the complainant. 9.The appellant was tried before a judge and jury.",

He did not testify at the trial, but the Crown led evidence of a statement he had made to the police. In the statement he admitted that he had forced the complainant to have sexual intercourse with him. He stated that he did not know why he had done it because he was drunk and that, \"when I realized what I was doing, I got off.\" In charging the jury, the trial judge made no reference to the intent requirement, beyond reading the jury the definition of assault. The jury was told that the sole issue was whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant had not consented to the intercourse because of the assault and threats made by the accused. With respect to drunkenness, the trial judge said as follows: \"Only the accused in his statement says, `I was all drunked up too.' There was no evidence of drunkenness except that statement and it is open to you to accept it and find that he was drunk but even if he was drunk, drunkenness is no defence to the charge alleged against this accused.\" 10.The appellant was convicted and sentenced to four years imprisonment. An appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario was dismissed (now reported at (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 574). Dubin J.A., delivering the oral judgment of the Court, said at p. 574: On the merits, the Crown's case was overwhelming. The complainant's testimony that she was forced to have sexual intercourse without her consent and the serious bodily injury which she suffered during the course of the assault was confirmed in every respect by other evidence. With respect, I agree. 11.Dubin J.A. concluded at p. 576: Mr. Ruby also took objection to passages in the judge's charge. We are all satisfied that the charge, when read as a whole, is more favourable to the appellant than the evidence warranted. In any event, we are satisfied that even if objection could be taken to some of the expressions used by the trial judge, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in this case.",

Constable Hickman had information, received from Kirkus and others, that the appellant was a supplier of narcotics. Constable Hickman instructed Kirkus to phone the appellant for the purpose of arranging a sale of narcotics. Following a discussion with Kirkus, Constable Hickman directed an undercover officer, Constable Adam, to go to a mall parking lot on March 15, 1982, approach a person sitting in a specific vehicle, and ask if he could purchase some drugs. Adam was provided with approximately $200 to that end. The person in the car was in fact Kirkus. Constable Hickman had told Kirkus that a man would approach him in his car. Neither Constable Adam nor Kirkus were informed of the fact they were both working for the police, in accordance with standard police procedure. It is clear, however, that Constable Adam suspected Kirkus was acting on behalf of the police upon meeting him at the mall. At all material times Constable Hickman was assisting in the surveillance of this undercover investigation of the appellant. 4.There were three narcotics transactions arising from the association set up by Kirkus between the appellant and the undercover Constable Adam, only the second of which the appellant was charged. 5.On March 15, 1982, Constable Adam met Kirkus and Kirkus drove him to the appellant's house. Kirkus introduced Constable Adam to the appellant. Constable Adam testified that Kirkus asked the appellant if he had any narcotics and the appellant, who had been told by Kirkus that a half‐pound of marijuana would be purchased, stated that he was \"doing pounds for $1,900.\" Constable Adam testified that he told the appellant he could not afford to buy a half‐pound at that time and it was arranged that the appellant and the officer meet again on March 18.

The two men discussed prices and Adam had the appellant stop so that Adam could obtain an additional $100 needed to buy one of the half‐pounds. At this time the appellant, upon being asked by Constable Adam, indicated that he could supply cocaine, \"red hair\" (marijuana) and he stated that he had been dealing for years and was lucky to find some really good sources.

Constable Adam gave evidence that a further drug transaction was set up and the appellant took him to the residence of a Scott Muirhead. The appellant introduced them and then left. A transaction involving five pounds of marijuana was concluded between Muirhead and the undercover officer. The appellant was not charged with respect to this sale although Muirhead was. 8.The appellant testified that he and Wade Kirkus were friends and they had known each other for approximately seven years.

The appellant did not pay for them but arranged to share the proceeds with Muirhead with the appellant earning $250 on the sale of one half‐pound. The appellant explained why he had two extra half‐pounds in the following manner: Well, Scott gave me more than one‐half pound, and I asked him why he was giving me more, and he told me, well, maybe the guy will like it and take more. It would just be more money for you, you are doing it now, so, you know, a few more dollars for you would be even better. I just‐‐I didn't say‐‐I couldn't say no. He just asked if there was a problem and I told him, no, I guess not. 14.The appellant was asked why he sold the half‐pound on the 18th, following the first meeting with Constable Adam.

He was persistently calling me, and the money was a factor. I just couldn't say no to a friend, who really wanted me to help him out. He sounded, not desperate, but almost desperate to the point where, you know, you've got to help me out just this once. So, his persistence, or his constant calling didn't stop, so I really didn't have the will to say no to a friend. So, I did it just the once. 15.The appellant insisted that the reason why he acted as if he knew about drugs and sources in his interactions with Constable Adam was because Muirhead told him to \"talk big\" and to appear like a drug dealer so as to impress the Constable and that he just did what Muirhead told him to do.

    "text": "The appellant was charged with unlawful possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. He testified at trial and, at the close of the case for the defence, brought an application for a stay of proceedings on the basis of entrapment. The application was refused and a conviction entered by Wetmore Co. Ct. J., sitting without a jury, in written reasons reported in (1983), 34 C.R. (3d) 228. A notice of appeal from that decision was filed with the British Columbia Court of Appeal but the appeal books were not filed within the time prescribed. Counsel for the appellant sought and obtained, with the consent of Crown Counsel, an order dispensing with the requirement that transcripts of evidence be filed and permitting counsel to base their arguments solely on the reasons for judgment of Wetmore Co. Ct. J. The Chief Justice of British Columbia directed that a panel of five judges hear the appeal. For the reasons given by Craig J.A., on behalf of the Court, the appeal was dismissed. This decision is now reported at (1985), 49 C.R. (3d) 169. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court. It is necessary to describe in some detail the relevant facts. In view of the particular procedural history of this appeal, I think it is appropriate to reproduce in its entirety the summary of the evidence provided for in the reasons for judgment of Wetmore Co. Ct. J. (at pp. 234‐37): Through information obtained from an officer of the Ontario Provincial Police, one Momotiuk was brought to British Columbia. This man had apparently been dealing in narcotics in Kenora, Ontario. He was placed under police \"handlers\" in Vancouver, he visited the accused on a number of occasions, and eventually a transaction was set up whereby the accused would deliver cocaine to Momotiuk. The accused testified. He first met Momotiuk in 1979 in Montreal where the accused was visiting one Franks. The accused understood Franks and Momotiuk to be associated in some clothing franchise. The accused at this time was attempting to develop some property for sale near De Roche, British Columbia, and told Franks and Momotiuk of this and both expressed some interest in buying. Both arrived in British Columbia in October 1979.",

    "text": "Both arrived in British Columbia in October 1979. In the course of this visit the accused says that Momotiuk told him he was a drug trafficker in Kenora and wanted some \"Thai pot\". The accused says he had no interest. Momotiuk, according to the accused, called later still wanting to make drug deals, and the accused told him he was interested only in real estate deals. The accused again went to a yoga retreat near Montreal in December 1979. Franks and Momotiuk visited him there. Momotiuk produced some cocaine, which he and Franks used, and again asked the accused to become a supplier. A few days later they met again. At this time conversation was directed to show Momotiuk as an importer of drugs on a large scale, and again the accused was invited to join in and refused. In January and February there were approximately seven telephone calls from Momotiuk to the accused soliciting his involvement. The accused says he refused. In mid‐February 1980 Momotiuk visited the accused again, asking him to supply drugs. The accused says he told Momotiuk he was not interested and asked to be left alone. Momotiuk continued to visit two or three times and also telephoned. In March the accused says Momotiuk arrived again. They went for a walk in the woods. Momotiuk produced a pistol and was going to show the accused his marksmanship. He was dissuaded because of the probability of startling the horses nearby. The accused says that at this remote area Momotiuk said, \"A person could get lost.\" This the accused says was a threat. He says the matter of drugs was again raised and the accused says he was adamant that he had no knowledge of drugs sources. The accused was asked to phone him twice and did not. One Matheson attended at the accused's residence on 13th March with a message that Momotiuk was very excited and wanted to see him at the Biltmore Hotel. The accused says he wanted nothing to do with Momo­tiuk but was terrified of him and agreed to go into town to the Biltmore. He also says that Matheson told him Momotiuk had some friends with him. This the accused took to be other members of this illegal syndicate. While en route to the city he twice noted a car which seemed to be following him.",

This was probably so, because undercover police officers were doing a surveillance at the time. On arrival at the hotel he met Momotiuk. Again he was informed of the syndicate. He was asked then if he wished to see the buying power. The accused agreed. He was directed to a car outside the hotel. In this car was an open briefcase with $50,000 exposed. The custodian, unknown to the accused, was an undercover policeman. The accused returned to the hotel, Momotiuk asked him to get a sample and gave him $50 for this purpose. The accused left and went to a supplier he had known of from years back. This supplier, one Goldsmith, now dead, heard the accused's story and agreed to supply \"in order to get Doug (Momotiuk) off me\". He obtained the sample and delivered it to Momotiuk, who tested it and said to get as much as he could. He returned to the supplier and offered $35,000 to $40,000 for a pound. At the meeting the following day the accused had still not acquired the drugs and he says that at this point he was told to get his act together, in a threatening way. I need not detail the accused's evidence of the following two days. He obtained 12 ounces of cocaine, and was to pay $27,000 for it. This credit, he says, was extended to him by Goldsmith on the basis of payment when delivered to Momotiuk. It was in the course of this delivery that he was arrested. It is on the basis of this testimony that the accused says he was entrapped. Momotiuk, Matheson and Franks did not testify. Neither did \"Bonnie\", the accused's former wife, who was apparently present at one of the Montreal meetings, where cocaine was produced and some discussion took place. The accused has drug convictions in 1972 and 1976, two in 1978 and one in 1979. Those in 1976, one in 1978 and one in 1979 involved cocaine. He says his former use of drugs arose to relieve back pain, but in 1978 he discovered relief from yoga and gave up the use of narcotics.",

Early in the afternoon, Constable Bisceglia appeared before a justice of the peace and applied under s. 10 of theNarcotic Control Actfor a warrant to search a dwelling for narcotics. The justice of the peace issued the search warrant. In compliance with s. 10(2) of the Act, the warrant named Constables Bisceglia, Arseneault, Clark, and Underhill, all of the R.C.M.P., as the peace officers authorized to enter and search the dwelling. The warrant was valid between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. of that day. 6.The officers went to the appellant's apartment at 4:00 p.m. but no‐one was home.

At approximately 6:00 p.m., Constable Arseneault learned that the appellant was at home, but was leaving shortly for Vancouver, and would not be back for two or three days. Constable Bisceglia decided to execute the warrant immediately, but Constables Clark and Underhill were about to go off duty. Constable Bisceglia telephoned the justice of the peace who had issued the search warrant, explained the circumstances, and asked if it would be possible to substitute two other officers. The justice of the peace authorized the substitution and the officers went to the appellant's apartment, arriving there around 6:20 p.m. All four were dressed in civilian clothes. 7.The police officers knocked on the door. The appellant answered. Two other men were in the apartment, in the living room. Constable Bisceglia gave the appellant a copy of the search warrant, showed his identification, and arrested the appellant for possession of marijuana. He then read the standard police warning, including the right to counsel guaranteed by theCharter. The appellant immediately picked up the phone and said he was going to call his lawyer, but Constable Bisceglia told him that he could not telephone until the police had \"matters under control.\" Constable Bisceglia then asked the appellant for his full name, address and age, and for some identification.",

He also wounded two other people. He was indicted on two counts of second degree murder, and at the trial raised the defences of insanity and, alternatively, intoxication. 2.The evidence led at trial revealed that the appellant was a member of a motorcycle club, a drug pusher, and highly suspicious of members of rival clubs. During the week of the shooting he had taken a great deal of cocaine and slept little. Defence psychiatrists testified that Mailloux's paranoid personality became aggravated by the cocaine and the result was a very rare condition, toxic psychosis. The psychiatrists said that this was a major mental illness which caused a break with reality and led to the appellant believing that he was acting in self‐defence. However, on the crucial issue of whether the appellant was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts and of knowing that they were wrong, the psychiatric evidence was conflicting. On examination in chief both psychiatrists said that he was not capable; under cross‐examination they said that he was. The jury found the appellant guilty of second degree murder on both counts. 3.Mailloux's appeal was argued on a number of grounds relating to the trial judge's direction to the jury on \"disease of the mind\", on whether the accused met the requirements ofs. 16(2)of theCriminal Code, and on intoxication. All of these grounds were rejected by the Court of Appeal and are not at issue before this Court, as the appellant was granted leave to appeal only on the correct interpretation to be placed on s. 613(1)(d) of theCode.",

    "text": "Hayes was convicted of first degree murder in March 1984 before Burchell J. of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court and a jury. The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for twenty-five years. The circumstances giving rise to this charge and conviction concern the murder of Edmund Foster. On the evening of October 5, 1983, the deceased, Foster, agreed to drive the appellant and Elmer King to a bootlegger. After the three drove outside the town of Glace Bay, a knife was held to Foster and he was robbed of his wallet. King then drove the car off the main highway to a rather deserted location where Foster was repeatedly stabbed with a knife. Foster died at the scene as a result of these wounds. The appellant and King then drove the deceased's car back into Glace Bay where it was set on fire. Both the appellant and King were subsequently arrested and charged with first degree murder relating to the death of Foster. At Hayes' trial, King testified that the robbery and murder were both carried out by Hayes. In turn, Hayes took the stand and claimed that it was King who robbed and fatally stabbed Foster. The dispute primarily concerned the respective roles of Hayes and King. Following the conviction of the appellant, King was tried for murder relating to the same incident. The jury returned a verdict of guilt on second degree murder. King was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole for twenty years. The appellant launched an appeal of his conviction before the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (R. v. Hayes(1985), 67 N.S.R. (2d) 234). However, when the transcripts of the trial were received prior to the appeal hearing, it was evident that there were gaps in the transcription of the proceedings. Apparently the gaps resulted from a malfunction of the transcribing equipment.",

All the members of the Court of Appeal concurred in the reasons given by Aylesworth J.A., McLennan J.A. having expressed his concurrence in conference although his unfortunate death oc- [Page 828] curred prior to the delivery of the reasons. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant in this court that in making the finding of guilt as to the accused Ciglen in reference to the Kroy‐Fulton deal the Court of Appeal forOntariowent beyond the jurisdiction conferred upon it. The appellant cites the two recent decisions in this court:Regina v. Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Limited[12]andLampard v. The Queen[13]. The appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal forOntariois governed by the provisions of s. 584 (1) of theCriminal Code.Subsection (1)(a) of that section provides: 584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the Court of appeal (a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone, It will be seen, therefore, that the right of appeal given to the Crown is limited to a question of \"law alone\". I am of the opinion that the three questions which the Court of Appeal was called upon to consider as to the guilt of the accused in reference to the Kroy-Fulton deal were all questions of law and that, therefore, when Aylesworth J.A. said, \"when the serious errors in law to which reference has been made are corrected, the facts as found by the trial Judge in the Kroy-Fulton deal lead inevitably to one conclusion—the guilt of the accused as charged\" he was giving a conclusion on questions of law. The first of those three questions was as to the meaning of the word \"suppressing\" as it appeared in the indictment. Surely the meaning in law to be given to a word which appears in an indictment or in a section of the Code is purely a question of law and the Court of Appeal had the jurisdiction to differ from the opinion of the learned trial judge as to the meaning in law of the word \"suppressing\".",

    "text": "The second question considered by the Court of Appeal forOntariowas the argument that it was impossible to convict the accused of an attempt to evade the payment of income tax without demon- [Page 829] strating that income tax was due by having the Minister declare that the payments received by the accused on the profits from trading in these shares were income. The view that such a decision was a decision necessary for the trial judge himself to make and was not a decision to be made by the Minister is certainly a decision upon a question of pure law and again the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to differ from the opinion of the learned trial judge thereon. InBelyea & Weinraub v. The King[14], this court considered an appeal by an accused person from a conviction rendered in the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Ontario after an acquittal at trial. The appellants and others had been charged with conspiracy contrary to the provisions of the then s. 498, subs. (1) (a), (b) and (e) of theCriminal Code,and the trial judge had found that the conspiracy existed but he had refused to convict these two appellants on the ground that no overt acts following the making of the agreement had been proved against them. The Appellate Division and this Court were both of the opinion that the Crown need not prove such overt acts. Anglin C.J.C. said at p. 296: But we cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact, made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,—especially where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge.",

The third question considered by the Court of Appeal was the professing to find a reasonable doubt based on the P.O.G.N. reports. These reports, as pointed out by Aylesworth J.A., were simply the echo of the conspiracy which the learned trial judge had found and, therefore, those reports could not, in evidence, supply a reasonable doubt. Again, I am of the opinion that this was a finding on pure law and was within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under s. 584(1) (a) of the Code. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal, in considering the three questions upon which the learned trial judge had professed to have based his reasonable doubt, were considering questions of law alone and that they had jurisdiction to come to their own decision on those questions of law and to differ from the learned trial judge, using, of course, alone his findings of fact. One other problem arises which does not seem to have been considered in the Court of Appeal. InThe Queen v. Warner[15], this court considered an appeal by the Crown. The accused had been found guilty of murder at trial, but the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversed that conviction and substituted therefor a conviction for manslaughter. In coming to this conclusion, the Appellate Division had assigned two reasons for allowing an appeal: firstly, that the verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on the ground that it could not be supported by the evidence; and, secondly, that there had been errors in law in the charge of the learned trial judge.",

[32]Canadian courts have been divided on the usefulness of the mixed statement instruction. While the precise wording of the instruction has varied from case to case, some versions of it have found appellate approval: seeR. v. Ryznar, [1986] 6 W.W.R. 210 (Man. C.A.), andR. v. Harrison(2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 117, 2001 BCCA 272. In other cases, the \"Duncaninstruction\" was held to constitute reversible error: seeR. v. Leblanc(2001), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 74 (Que. C.A.), andR. v. Samuels(2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (Ont. C.A.). [33]The British Columbia Court of Appeal recently considered aDuncan-type instruction inR. v. David(2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 64, 2006 BCCA 412, a decision released shortly after the hearing of this appeal in the court below. Counsel for Miguel Rojas advised this Court that following the decision inDavid, the Court of Appeal agreed to receive additional submissions from counsel on the impact ofDavidon the case at bar. After receiving the submissions, the Court of Appeal advised that it would issue no further comment. [34]Ryan J.A., writing for the court inDavid, reviewed the divergent appellate decisions on the mixed statement instruction and concluded that while none of them were determinative of the question that occupied the court, \"lessons [could] be taken fromHarrison,RojasandSamuels\" . She explained as follows (at para. 42): While an appeal court will look at each case to determine whether a like charge has led to an unfair trial, it is dangerous for a trial judge to instruct a jury that inculpatory and exculpatory statements ought to be weighed differently. Trial judges should leave such \"common sense\" arguments to the lawyers in their closing addresses. InDavid, having regard to the wording of the instruction and its context, the court concluded that \"what otherwise might have been a suggestion as to how the jury could approach the weighing of the evidence\" was effectively transformed \"to a rule of law that they were obliged to apply\" . The court therefore gave effect to this ground of appeal inDavidand ordered a new trial. [35]As we can see, theDuncaninstruction is rooted in basic evidentiary rules concerning the admission of out-of-court statements.",

    "text": "The court therefore gave effect to this ground of appeal inDavidand ordered a new trial. [35]As we can see, theDuncaninstruction is rooted in basic evidentiary rules concerning the admission of out-of-court statements. As the court put it: \"What a person says out of court is, generally speaking, not admissible to prove the truth of what he says\" (p. 363). This general exclusionary rule applies in regard to both inculpatory and exculpatory statements. Confessions, however, fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, and the very rationale for the admissibility of admissions by an accused is that admissions against interest are likely to be true. As Cory J. stated inR. v. Hodgson, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at para. 17: . . . the basis for the admission of a statement of the accused as an exception to the rule against hearsay is that what people freely say which is contrary to their interest is probably true. [36]Exculpatory out-of-court statements made by an accused are also subject to the general exclusionary rule against hearsay. Where the accused testifies, such statements are generally inadmissible because they are viewed as self-serving and lacking in probative value. Where the accused does not testify, there is an additional rationale for excluding such statements. McIntyre J. explained it inR. v. Simpson, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3, as follows (at p. 22): As a general rule, the statements of an accused person made outside court — subject to a finding of voluntariness where the statement is made to one in authority — are receivable in evidence against him but not for him. This rule is based on the sound proposition that an accused person should not be free to make an unsworn statement and compel its admission into evidence through other witnesses and thus put his defence before the jury without being put on oath and being subjected, as well, to cross‐examination. [37]Of course, the general rule that excludes out-of-court exculpatory statements is not without exceptions. One such exception is relevant here — the mixed statement exception. Just as in England, it has long been established that where the Crown seeks to tender an accused's out‐of-court statement which contains both inculpatory and exculpatory parts, it must tender the entire statement, and the exculpatory portions are substantively admissible in favour of the accused:R. v.",

The purpose of this examination was to document any injuries, determine whether any care was needed, and comment on the child's immunization status. During her examination, Ms. De Coene noticed nothing unusual — K.M. had no bruising, scrapes or cuts, his abdomen was soft, and he showed no indication of soreness or tenderness. [46]On May 19, R.G., a friend of the foster mother, noticed a bruise in the middle of K.M.'s forehead, marks on his chin and scratches on the top of his head. She was surprised when she saw the scratches, because she had seen none like them on children before, and she drew her sister's attention to them. However, the thought that K.M.'s foster mother was mistreating him did not occur to her. [47]Sometime in the month before K.M.'s death, L.K., also a friend of the foster mother, noticed a large bruise on his eye that extended across his face from one cheek to the other. However, L.K. saw K.M. at his home about one week before his death and did not notice any injuries. [48]J.F.'s mother, Jean F., said that K.M. had visited her home fewer than 10 times during the two months he lived with her son. She testified that her husband had bought K.M. a bicycle and that K.M. had fallen off the bike several times. She had not seen many bruises on K.M., nor had she ever seen either of the foster parents strike him. Jean F. did not really see K.M. during her last visit to the house before his death. [49]Approximately one week before K.M.'s death, J.K., the foster mother of K.M.'s biological sister, noted that his behaviour was different. She testified that he was acting \"scared\". However, K.M. had visited her home twice, and she had not seen any injuries on him. [50]Three days before K.M.'s death, L.K. and another friend went shopping with the foster mother and K.M. They heard the foster mother call K.M. \"stupid\", which L.K. testified was unusual because she did not normally speak to people like that.",

[51]On Tuesday, June 20, J.F. was home the morning his wife inflicted the wounds that caused K.M.'s death. He told the police that he was sleeping when the injuries occurred and awoke only when his wife came running into the room holding the child, saying that he was not breathing properly. This account of the morning's events differed from what he told the Chief of the First Nation Territory of Sandy Lake (that his wife came in to tell him something was wrong with the child, whom he found in another room), his mother (that he found the child on the floor), and a friend, D.K. (that he heard a bang and saw the child lying on the floor). [52]J.F. took K.M. to the local nursing station. When they arrived, the child was not breathing and had no pulse. The nurse, Ms. De Coene, observed that \"he had bruises all over his body, to his face, his neck . . . his arms and his legs\". She testified that he had an abrasion on his neck, blueness around his lips, lacerations on his chin, a slightly infected wound at the top of his foot, a swollen nose and dried blood in his right nostril, and that his foreskin was scraped and swollen. She added that she had never before seen a child in this condition and that she was \"shocked by the number of bruises\" he had. [53]Despite efforts to save him, K.M. died shortly after arriving at the nursing station. [54]The cause of death was determined to be multiple blunt traumas to the head. The interval between K.M.'s fatal injuries and his death was between two and three hours. In addition to the multiple blunt traumas to his head, he suffered haemorrhaging in the small bowel.

[55]The police investigation into K.M.'s death revealed that his blood was on two towels, his bed sheet, a comforter, the wall of his bedroom, the wall of the master bedroom and the bathroom floor. The police also found a child's t-shirt that was stained and smelled of vomit. There was an indentation in the bathroom wall with several cracks at approximately K.M.'s height. One of his hairs was found imbedded in the cracks, along with traces of his blood. Three knives were found in the bathroom. [56]J.F. gave three statements to the police — one on the day K.M. died and two the following day. In his third statement, J.F. told the police that on the night before K.M.'s death, he had seen multiple bruises on the child's legs, arms and chest and a \"scratch\" on his penis. J.F. said that he had asked K.M. where he got the scratch, and that K.M. told him the family puppy had bitten his penis. J.F. then asked K.M. to show him where he was hurting, and the child indicated his thighs, chest, arms and the back of his head. J.F. felt the back of K.M.'s head and noted that it felt swollen.

The Corporation of the Village of Huntingdon(1891), 19 S.C.R. 363, leading to a conclusion that the appealing party had no actual interest and that a decision could have no effect on the parties except as to costs. Similarly, in a fact situation analogous to this appeal, the Privy Council refused to address the constitutionality of challenged legislation where two statutes in question were repealed prior to the hearing:Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney- General for Canada, [1939] A.C. 117 (P.C.)

Mathews, [1944] S.C.R. 385, andSun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. Jervis, [1944] A.C. 111. InCoca-Cola v.

This is similar to those situations in which an appeal from a criminal conviction is seen as moot where the accused has fulfilled his sentence prior to an appeal:Re Maltby v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan(1984), 10 D.L.R. (4th) 745 (Sask. C.A.) The issue of mootness has arisen more frequently in American jurisprudence, and there, the doctrine is more fully developed. This may be due in part to the constitutional requirement, contained in s. 2(1) of Article III of the American Constitution, that there exist a \"case or controversy\": Section 2. [1] The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;--to Controversies between two or more States;--between a State and Citizens of another State;--between Citizens of different States;--between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. However, despite the constitutional enshrinement of the principle, the mootness doctrine has its roots in common law principles similar to those in Canada: see \"The Mootness Doctrine in the Supreme Court\" (1974), 88Harvard L.R. 373, at p. 374. Situations resulting in a finding of mootness are similar to those in Canada. For example, inHall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45 (1969), a challenge to a Colorado voter residency requirement of six months was held moot due to a legislative change in the law removing the plaintiff from the application of the statute. Mootness was also raised inUnited States v. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953), where a defendant voluntarily ceased allegedly unlawful conduct. Similarly, inSibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968), mootness was an issue where an accused completed his sentence prior to an appeal of his conviction. The American jurisprudence indicates a similar willingness to consider the merits of an action in some circumstances even when the controversy is no longer concrete and tangible.",

    "text": "[64]It might be argued that evidence that was accepted in the first case — that the accused did not know he lacked sufficient funds to cover the cheque — and led to an acquittal, was rejected in a second case, leading to a conviction. However, confining issue estoppel to its proper domain of preventing relitigation of issues resolved in favour of the accused in an earlier proceeding, yields a different result. In the first trial, the factual issue of state of mind was resolved in the accused's favour on the basis of his evidence that he thought he had sufficient funds. On the second trial, the evidence was called not to show that the earlier determination was in error, but to show that on the second occasion the accused could not have believed he had sufficient funds to cover the cheque, as he could not have made the same mistake twice. This rationale does not involve challenging the judicial determination in the first trial or in any way rejecting the findings at the first trial as to the accused's state of mind. The original acquittal, and the reasons for it, stand unimpeached. Yet, the facts on which it was based may have relevance in the second trial and can be admitted on that basis, without calling the first finding into question. As Cory J. noted inArp, a careful jury instruction is required in these circumstances . [65]If the Crown is not trying to contradict the factual finding at the first trial, issue estoppel does not apply. The relevant question is whether the Crown is leading evidence which is inconsistent with the factual findings in the first trial (even if those findings were arrived at on the basis of reasonable doubt). A jury charge to this effect, coupled with a caution not to use the evidence underlying the prior acquittal to support reasoning that the accused in fact committed the offence for which he was previously acquitted, suffice to preserve the protections offered by the principle of issue estoppel, without rendering the trial unworkable. [66]Another apparent difficulty is the so-calledArpanomaly. Issue estoppel holds that where an issue is decided in favour of the accused in a first trial that leads to an acquittal, evidence on that issue cannot be used as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial.",

Yet, the similar fact rule permits evidence of similar facts to be called in a multi-count trial. This produces the following anomaly. If the issue on which the Crown seeks to lead similar fact evidence was determined in a previous trial ending in acquittal, it is inadmissible on a second trial. However, if the same fact is relevant to two offences being tried together, it may be admissible. What determines admissibility is not the nature of the evidence, but whether it has been the subject of a previous trial that led to an acquittal. At first glance, this does not seem right, since the evidence's admissibility turns on what will sometimes be arbitrary factors leading to consecutive rather than multi-count trials. [67]InArp, this Court,perCory J., held that the principle of issue estoppel, as applied to previous acquittals, \"has no application where the alleged similar acts are the subject of a multi-count indictment\" . However, uncertainty remains. Does this mean that the Crown can lead evidence regarding acts which have been the subject of acquittals as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial? (See L. Stuesser, \"Admitting Acquittals as Similar Fact Evidence\" (2002), 45Crim. L.Q.488.) Or is the ruling in error, as others have suggested? (See R. Mahoney, \"Acquittals as Similar Fact Evidence: Another View\" (2003), 47Crim. L.Q.265; see also K. Wright, \"Similar Fact Multiple Count Indictments — A Reply\" (1994), 32 C.R. (4th) 301 (written beforeArp).) [68]It could be argued thatArpis in tension with the issue estoppel, as defined by Lamer J. inGrdic, because in a joint trial on multiple counts, the effect ofArpmay be that the accused does not get the benefit of factual issues on which the jury has a reasonable doubt on one count.

[70]Second, the joint trial of multiple counts raises the problem of how to charge the jury if the law were to require that the evidence of one count be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before it could be used as similar fact evidence on another count. The general rule fromR. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, that individual pieces of evidence need not be proved on the reasonable doubt standard militates against holding (and charging a jury) that the evidence of one count cannot be used as similar fact evidence on another count unless the first count is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the rationales for issue estoppel, the difference in result depending on the order in which charges are tried or whether they are tried together, is defensible in this context. The Court inArpaccepted this argument (at paras. 64-79) as the basis for distinguishing the multi-count indictment situation from the acquittal at a prior trial situation. [71]Third, it has been suggested that the so-calledArpanomaly can be resolved with a jury instruction (see Stewart, at p. 396). To satisfy the principle of issue estoppel where one trial follows another, what must be avoided at the second proceeding is reliance on issues that have earlier been resolved in the accused's favour. It follows that in a trial with multiple counts of similar allegations, what must be avoided is a situation where the trier of fact rejects the evidence led on one count, yet uses it to find guilt on a different count. This can be cured by an instruction to the jury. [72]SinceR. v. Handy, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, 2002 SCC 56, an essential step in the admissibility and use of similar fact evidence is the identification of the specific factual issue on which the evidence is probative of the improbability of coincidence. This may be the identity of the offender, the unlikelihood that independent witnesses would tell similar stories, or any other relevant and probative inference.",

In a multi-count indictment, the trier of fact should instruct himself, or in the case of a jury be instructed, that if the trier of fact rejects the evidence on such an issue in a particular count, then it cannot use that evidence in deciding the verdict in any other of the counts (see Stewart, at p. 396). Indeed, Cory J. suggests a similar instruction in point (6) of the model jury charge inArp. [73]In summary, if issue estoppel is understood according to its defining features, as discussed earlier, the inconsistency between the rule and other principles of evidence and common sense largely disappears. E.Conclusion on the Retention of Issue Estoppel on the Criminal Law [74]There can be no doubt that the principle of issue estoppel, as applied in Canada sinceGrdic, has led to inconsistencies with other principles of criminal law and common sense. The question on this appeal, as I see it, is whether these inconsistencies should lead this Court to remove issue estoppel entirely from Canadian criminal law, or whether it should modify the current Canadian position on issue estoppel to alleviate the difficulties. [75]I have argued that an approach to issue estoppel that confines it to discrete issues decided in the accused's favour in a previous proceeding is consistent with the history and theory of issue estoppel and, if adopted, would avoid the anomalies the broadened post-Grdicview of the doctrine has introduced. I have also argued that, understood in this form, issue estoppel is an important component of the criminal law, and that other doctrines and rules of evidence afford only incomplete protection of the goals that underlie the doctrine: fairness to the accused, coherence and consistency of criminal proceedings and finality of judicial proceedings. [76]These arguments satisfy me that the principle of issue estoppel should be retained as part of Canadian criminal law. [77]It is not necessary in this case to resolve the question of whether issue estoppel applies to situations where there is a disposition such as a stay at a first trial: see, for example,R. v. Regan(1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 286 (N.S.S.C.);Rulli.",

On the one hand, cases of stays often involve determinations not based on the merits, and thus may not give rise to any factual findings (or, as Professor Stewart points in relation to entrapment, factual findings contrary to the accused may have been made, since entrapment is not even considered until after a finding of guilt has been made (pp. 389-90)). On the other hand, in many cases where a stay was issued for reasons such as abuse of process or unreasonable delay, the factors which led to the stay may still be compelling when an attempt is made by the Crown to use the evidence at a later proceeding. It may well be that a more flexible approach such as abuse of process should be used for these cases, rather than issue estoppel. However, as this case does not engage a fact situation involving a stay of proceedings, I leave that issue for a future case.",

    "text": "On April 21, 1983 the appellant, Pierre Potvin, his girl friend Josée Thibault and Benoît Deschênes met in a bar and planned to go to the home of an acquaintance, Paulette Liversain, and steal her jewellery. The three, along with two other friends, arrived at the home of Mrs. Liversain at 2:30 in the morning of April 22, 1983. The two other friends left shortly after their arrival in order to obtain more beer. What happened next is not exactly clear. Liversain apparently became aware of the trio's intentions and was severely beaten. She died of her injuries and the appellant, Josée Thibault and Benoît Deschênes were all charged with second degree murder. The Crown proceeded against the appellant first with the intention of using the other two as witnesses. Although he had testified at the preliminary inquiry, Benoît Deschênes refused to testify at the appellant's trial. The Crown then applied to the judge to have the transcript of Deschênes' testimony at the preliminary inquiry introduced as evidence at the appellant's jury trial unders. 643(1)of theCriminal Code. The trial judge held that the requirements ofs. 643(1)of theCriminal Codehad been met and that the previously taken testimony should be admitted as evidence at the trial. The appellant's defence was that Josée Thibault and Benoît Deschênes and not himself inflicted the fatal injuries on Mrs. Liversain. The appellant was found guilty of second degree murder.",

    "text": "At the time of the alleged offence, March 1, 1974, the appellant, twenty years of age, was a third year geology student in an honours science course at theUniversity ofToronto. During the fall of 1973, he had spent some time with the [Page 525] complainant, also a third year science student, with whom he shared a number of classes. Along with two male classmates, the two studied and lunched together. Their social activities extended to walks together, dinner at one another's homes and forays to a local bar. The appellant was somewhat shy and though he began to develop strong feelings for the attractive, out-going complainant, the sentiment was not reciprocated. Plans for the ski trip to Quebec were made in November and the two planned to share a room. The complainant then invited another student to accompany them, creating a more platonic overtone. The three did in fact go to Quebec. The appellant testified that his relationship with the complainant deteriorated in early 1974. They no longer went on walks or visited for dinner. He still saw much of her at school. On February 28, 1974, the complainant asked the appellant to assist her with an assignment. While she was absent a few moments, he flipped through her books to locate an equation and found a letter she had written to a female friend. He took the letter without her knowledge and read it at home that evening. The letter contains a number of references to sexual activity, both actual and wished for. Toward the end of the letter, this paragraph appears: And for some reason all the guys I know want to go out with me and not be just friends any more so I can't talk to them. I don't want to go out with them and they know it so there is static in the air which is why I want to leave. Hell I can insult Wayne [the appellant] and Rick and they still bug me in class. I want to be alone or with just one good guy, not with a bunch of nothings. The appellant was hurt and angry as he read the letter. He marked the passages referred to above with a pen. The following morning, he removed a rock sample of galena from the geology lab.",

The following morning, he removed a rock sample of galena from the geology lab. This was not unusual, for he was permitted to take samples [Page 526] home for purposes of study. At about noon, as he left to watch a squash match, he met the complainant. He testified that, \"just for about a second, not even that, I felt sort of strange, I can't describe how I felt\". He referred to it as a flash. He suggested she watch the match with him. The two proceeded to the squash court. The game was not in progress, so they left by the far stairwell. The appellant remembered asking her what she thought of Gord, a friend of theirs, hearing the reply that he was \"just a friend\", and \"really the next thing I remember was choking her and I remember the face was a funny colour and I remember seeing a lot of blood and I stopped\". He realized his hands were around her throat. The complainant testified that following the question about Gord, the appellant then asked, \"What do you think of me?\" She replied, \"You're just a friend too\". As she opened a set of fire doors, she heard a crash and a \"crumbling sound\". The appellant grabbed her around the arms and struck her on the head. She lost consciousness momentarily. When she recovered consciousness, he was choking her. A student happened along, to whom the appellant said, \"there's been a terrible accident\". He was pale, sweating, glassy-eyed and had a frightened expression. When the witness looked over the railing and saw the complainant's head, her body being under the stairs, the appellant said, \"I've killed her and I am going to kill you too\". The appellant had only a partial recollection of his encounter with this witness. A professor who was summoned testified that the appellant was very pale and bewildered. His description of the appellant was that he was perspiring; very, very nervous; distraught; upset; absolutely pale, no colour in his face; had moisture about the mouth; was shakey, jerky in his speech; absolutely bewildered, \"out of it\". In reply, he said that although the appellant was halting in his [Page 527] speech, he was coherent.",

His pulse was very fast and not strong; he had a limp \"clammy\" appearance. She was unable to convince him he had not killed the complainant. To the Dean, the appellant said, \"I don't know why I started or why I stopped\" and that, \"he liked her better than anyone he had ever known\". The Dean testified the appellant spoke slowly in a confused sort of way, was very depressed and perhaps dazed. To Constable Pollitt, the appellant said, \"I did it, I know I did it, I just couldn't stop hitting her\". The appellant gave a statement to the police, which reads in part: I was asking her about the ballet, then I asked her if she liked this guy Gord. She said something about just as a friend, then I guess I hit her right then on the head, she was bleeding from the head and the next thing I remember it all happened so fast she was on the floor and I was sitting on top of her choking her. I thought she was dead there was blood everywhere, I just don't know what happened. The statement concluded: I don't know why I did it because I wasn't even mad when this happened, and I don't remember parts of what happened and when I realized what I had done I went to the nurse's office and then to phone the police, I actually thought I'd killed somebody. A number of character witnesses spoke highly of the appellant. Evidence was led that he had been a well behaved young man until this incident. He had never lost his temper or displayed signs of anger. The complainant made a complete recovery within a short time.",

Moreover, we are further of the view that there was ample evidence from which the jury could conclude that the appellant meant to cause the deceased bodily harm and that he knew it was likely to cause the death of the deceased.

At about 7:15 p.m. on the evening in question, in early December, Dr. Herman was turning into his driveway in his car when, from a distance of 20 to 30 feet, he glanced fleetingly at a man walking from his next door neighbour's property. He did not consider it of importance at the time. There was no natural light but a bright street lamp provided illumination. A four-foot hedge separated the two properties, and to some extent obstructed Dr. Herman's view of the man. Four days later Dr. Herman picked out, from a random selection of a dozen photographs, two photographs of Mr. Park as resembling (ninety-nine percent certainty) the man he had seen. At trial Dr. Herman testified that Mr. Park strongly resembled the man, although he seemed of lighter weight and was not wearing the same type of clothes. Dr. Herman could not be certain. After the plea and before evidence was offered at Mr. Park's trial the following remarks were made by Mr. Lewis, counsel for Mr. Park (now His Honour Judge Lewis) in relation to (i) the potential evidence of the constable who had arrest- [Page 68] ed Mr. Park, and (ii) the defence position regarding the voluntariness of the only statement made to a police officer, Sergeant Cosgrove: WILEY: (Crown Counsel) And I believe when the appropriate time comes in the evidence my friend knows of the Constable's evidence and he is prepared to admit that, and is prepared to concede that it doesn't concern the fact of the voluntariness of any statement that the Crown may proceed to introduce.

    "text": "It is submitted that the phrase \"facts proved or admitted\" indicate that the Court relied upon the admissions of fact made pursuant to the plea of guilty to the charge of attempted armed robbery. It is argued that, apart from those admissions, the evidence against the appellant consisted merely of the fact that he was driving a vehicle some twenty to forty miles away from the scene of the offence, some one-half hour after the offence and this vehicle had passengers who were connected to the offence of attempted armed robbery. I do not know what the Court of Appeal intended by the reference to facts admitted. I agree with counsel for the appellant that in the absence of consent (and there was none) it was not open to the trial judge to look to the admitted facts on the guilty plea under count one in determining that the appellant was a party to the weapons offence [Page 306] under count two. A careful reading of the transcript makes it clear, however, that that was not what the trial judge did. When the time came for Crown counsel to read the statement of facts, the following exchange took place. Mr. Hermiston was counsel for Mr. McGuigan. CROWN: The only problems [sic]that I can foresee Your Honour, as My Friend says, that would be the argument on Section eighty-three is a legal argument, rather than an argument on the factual situation. But I—if I read the facts in, there's certain aspects of that fact that are not acceptable to the Accused, then we're in a position that I—I may prejudice the not guilty plea. BY THE COURT: I think if you just read in sufficient facts to substantiate the plea of guilty? CROWN: They're both intertwined. I'm in agreement to read in the facts. There's no problems [sic]there, but as long as My Friends feel that it's not going to prejudice their defense... BY THE COURT: Well I'm not going to take those facts into consideration on a plea of not guilty. I mean they haven't admitted anything on a plea of not guilty, except that they're here. HERMISTON: I don't think there's too much problem. We substantially agree to certain facts on the guilty plea, and if there's certain facts that we don't agree to, but nevertheless admit our guilt.",

BY THE COURT: All right. Read—I'd like to hear the facts on the plea. CROWN: Your Honour, the facts on the plea to the robbery, or attempted robbery, indicates that... At the conclusion of the reading of the statement, the Court asked the accused to stand up and then continued: On the basis of the information provided by the Crown Attorney, and to the extent to which that is acknowledged by the Pros-[sic] by the Defense Counsel, there will be a conviction of each of you on this charge. CROWN: Can we deal with the next trial matter? [Page 307] BY THE COURT: CROWN: All right. I'll call Mr. Kim to the Witness Box. Then followed the oral testimony of the seven witnesses, the evidence of whom I have earlier summarized. Apart from the statement of facts, there was thus a considerable body of evidence, including the finding of a nylon mask, shot-gun shells and a broken windshield, which was available against the appellant on the second charge. The appellant did not testify. During argument in this Court, counsel for the appellant stated he did not wish a new trial for his client; he was asking for an acquittal or nothing. It was pointed out to him that in the circumstances of the case there was some evidence against his client. The Court was not faced with a situation of \"no evidence\", therefore no question of law was raised which might engage the jurisdiction of the Court. Crown counsel was advised that he did not have to respond to the argument on the first ground of appeal. The second ground of appeal was phrased in this manner: Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the application of s. 83 of theCriminal Codeof Canada is not limited to cases in which the person charged with using a firearm during the commission or attempted commission of an indictable offence, himself uses the firearm while he is himself committing or attempting to commit the indictable offence?",

    "text": "It is contended that only the person who actually uses a firearm falls within s. 83 of theCodeand that s. 21 cannot therefore be invoked on a charge under s. 83. Section 21 of theCriminal Codereads: 21.(1) Every one is a party to an offence who (a) actually commits it, (b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or (c) abets any person in committing it. (2) Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them [Page 308] who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence. The Court of Appeal, speaking through Mr. Justice Martin, rejected this contention when the point was argued in that Court. The Court could not find any Parliamentary intention to exclude the application of s. 21 of theCodeto a charge under s. 83 and held that both ss. 21(1) and (2) are applicable to a charge under s. 83, if warranted by the evidence. The reasoning of this Court inZanini v. The Queen,[1967] S.C.R. 715 was relied upon. The Court of Appeal concluded (at p. 310): We are all of the view that it was open to the trial Judge to conclude that these accused entered into a common purpose to commit the offence of armed robbery and that each of them knew or ought to have known that the use of a firearm was a probable consequence of the carrying out of that unlawful purpose. This was not a case where the firearm in question was a small hand-gun capable of being concealed upon the person of one of the accused in circumstances where the others might not know that he was in possession of a gun. Here, the firearm was a shot-gun belonging to one of the accused, carried by another accused and transported in a car driven by the third accused and in which shot-gun shells were found.",

With respect, I agree. The second ground of appeal cannot be sustained. I turn then to the final, and weightiest, ground on which this appeal is brought, namely, that the rule against multiple convictions enunciated inKienapple v. The Queen, supra,was a bar to a conviction for the offence under s. 83, because the shot-gun mentioned in the attempted robbery charge is the same shot-gun as is referred to in the firearms charge under s. 83 of theCode.The ground of appeal is stated thus in the appellant's factum: \"The Court of Appeal forOntarioerred in law in holding that the learnedProvincial Court [Page 309] Judge erred in holding that the Appellant may not be convicted of the weapons offence and of attempted armed robbery, where both offences arise out of the use of a single firearm during a single transaction.\" It will be recalled that Provincial Court Judge Anjo gave effect to this submission in acquitting Mr. McGuigan of the firearms charge. Since the judgment of Provincial Court Judge Anjo, renderedFebruary 27, 1979, four courts of appeal have reached the opposite conclusion.

(c) being armed with an offensive weapon or instrument robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person. 302.Every one commits obbery who ... (d) steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof Again there are differences in the two sections. The present definition of \"firearm\" in s. 82(1) is narrow in that, for example, it excludes a firearm which cannot be fired. It reads: \"firearm\" means any barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and includes any frame or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can be adapted for use as a firearm; InQuonthe accused had entered a restaurant armed with a revolver and robbed the proprietor of $75. He pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to s. 446(c) of theCode,was found guilty of having on his person a revolver, contrary to s. 122 of theCode,and was sentenced to a term of two years on each count. The Appellate Court for Ontario quashed the conviction under the second count on the basis that the words \"any criminal offence\" in s. 122 \"do not include any criminal offence an essential element of which is the possession upon the person of the pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person\". A Crown appeal to this Court was dismissed. Justices Estey, Taschereau and Kellock each wrote. Chief Justice Rinfret agreed with Mr. Justice Estey. Mr. Justice Kerwin dissented. If I understand the reasoning of the majority correctly, it proceeded on two main lines. First, the words \"any criminal offence\" in s. 122 must be given a narrow meaning, otherwise a person could be charged under then s. 118 with the criminal offence of having a pistol upon his person elsewhere than in his dwelling house without a permit, [Page 312]",

    "text": "The appellants Sharon Turpin and Latif Siddiqui were jointly charged along with Whitley Clauzel with the first degree murder of Paul Turpin. Paul Turpin was Sharon Turpin's husband and he was killed on February 8, 1983. The appellant Sharon Turpin made a pre-trial motion on April 29, 1985 unders. 520(3)of theCriminal Codeto be tried separately from the two co-accused claiming that she would be prejudiced by the introduction at her trial of statements made by them. On May 3, 1985 the trial judge granted the motion for a separate trial on the condition that Sharon Turpin would only be entitled to a separate trial if she was tried by a judge and jury and not by a judge alone. The trial judge stated: Without repeating the evidence, I would conclude that before a jury, that is, if presented before a jury such statements would be clearly prejudicial to the applicant as they are totally inadmissible against her. I would therefore conclude that the ends of justice require, or would require that an order be made that she be tried separately if she is to be tried by a jury . . . . On May 9, 1985 the trial judge ruled on a motion made by the appellants and the co-accused Whitley Clauzel for a trial by a judge alone. The trial judge held that the effect ofs. 11(f)of theCharterwas to allow the accused to elect whether to be tried by a judge and jury or by a judge alone. He also ruled thatss. 427,428and429of theCriminal Codeviolateds. 15of theCharterbecause s. 430 gave individuals charged with the same offence in Alberta an election to be tried by a judge alone. All three forthwith elected to be tried by a judge alone and the trial proceeded. On July 25, 1985 the trial judge acquitted the appellant Sharon Turpin and convicted the appellant Latif Siddiqui and the co-accused Whitley Clauzel of second degree murder. The Crown appealed and on August 20, 1987 the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the ground that the trial judge had conducted the trial without jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal set aside the verdicts and ordered a new trial for first degree murder for all three accused. The appellants appealed to this Court as of right pursuant to s. 618(2) of theCriminal Code.",

    "text": "(Emphasis added.) In my view, this latter meaning could not have been the one intended in s. 5 of theCodeof 1927 defining \"Finding of the indictment\" as including \"the exhibiting of an information\". Indeed, there is no reason to preclude informations that are sworn and consider only those that were not as amounting to indictments \"found\". That would not make any sense. In fact, were it not for the 1953-54 amendments to theCriminal Codeit could be seriously questioned whether the word \"information\" in theCodedefinition of indictment even before 1953 meant anything other than a \"criminal information\". In any event, even assuming that information did include those before justices, reference to these old sections derived as they are from ancient practice would still leave us facing the original question of if and when an information may be found. The fact that Parliament, when abolishing criminal informations in 1953, deleted the words \"exhibiting an information\" but left the word \"information\" in the definition of indictment, clearly indicates that information, whatever the word may have included in the predecessor sections, as of then referred to those [Page 154] informations before Justices and those only, as there existed as of then none else. For these reasons I do not, with respect, think that anything turns upon the predecessor sections. However, reference to the historical evolution of the powers enjoyed by the Attorney General in the charging process to which I shall allude shortly is of prime importance. Now to consider the views of the Court of Appeal. With respect, I do not find compelling the first and third reasons upon which they predicated their conclusion. As regards the first of those reasons, all that s. 508(2) says is that you need not start all over to recommence the proceedings. It does not follow that laying a new information would amount to the \"finding of an information\". If the Attorney General does choose to start all over, he will of necessity have to lay an information. Prior to the addition in 1972 of s. 508(2) to what is now s. 508(1), there was uncertainty as to whether you had to prefer a new charge or whether you could start the proceedings again by carrying on at the point the proceedings were stayed.

The Court of Appeal's third reason was expressed as follows: Since the decision of the Justice of the Peace to proceed with the charges involves the issue of process in the name of the Sovereign, it would seem appropriate that the Attorney-General as the chief law officer of the Crown should have the power to prevent the use of such process where he considers that the proceedings should be stayed. This involves an executive decision which historically, and now by statute, has been vested in the Attorney-General. This decision is not reviewable by the Courts and is one for which he is in turn accountable to the Legislature or to Parliament, as the case may be. [Page 155] The right of a private citizen to lay an information, and the right and duty of the Attorney‐General to supervise criminal prosecutions are both fundamental parts of our criminal justice system. There is nothing there said with which I take issue. However, with respect, I fail to see why the conclusion dictated by these remarks would of necessity be that the law should be interpreted as did the Court of Appeal. Indeed, prior to that determination by the Justices of the Peace, there being no summons or warrant issued, one could say that the process is not yet put into operation. Furthermore, when the Attorney General in the exercise of his supervisory power over criminal prosecutions chooses to prevent the use of the criminal process, as is his right, his accountability to the Legislature would be much greater if he acted after the Justice of the Peace has determined that there is cause to issue process. The power to stay is a necessary one but one which encroaches upon the citizen's fundamental and historical right to inform under oath a Justice of the Peace of the commission of a crime. Parliament has seen fit to impose upon the justice an obligation to \"hear and consider\" the allegation and make a determination. In the absence of a clear and unambiguous text taking away the right, it should be protected.",

    "text": "Parliament has seen fit to impose upon the justice an obligation to \"hear and consider\" the allegation and make a determination. In the absence of a clear and unambiguous text taking away the right, it should be protected. This is particularly true when considering a text of law that is open to an interpretation that favours the exercise of that right whilst amply accommodating the policy consideration that supports the power to stay. When one adds to these considerations the fact that, apart from the court's control, the only one left is that of the legislative branch of government, given a choice, any interpretation of the law, which would have the added advantage of better ensuring the Attorney General's accountability by enhancing the legislative capacity to superintend the exercise of his power, should be preferred. An historical review of the evolution of the Crown's power to avoid the preliminary inquiry or the grand jury indicates an intent on the part of Parliament to increase the Attorney General's accountability. The most recent manifestation of [Page 156] this evolution is found in the amendments brought to the Crown's power to by-pass a preliminary inquiry and to prefer indictments directly before a grand or petit jury. Prior to 1969, not only the Attorney General but his agent, and the Deputy Attorney General, and any one with the written consent of the Attorney General could prefer an indictment directly. The 1969 amendments first took out of the list of those who could indict, even following a preliminary inquiry, the Deputy Attorney General because he was not considered as being an agent of the Attorney General. As for by-passing a preliminary inquiry or a discharge, his agents or others, even with his written consent, can no longer do so. The Attorney General himself or a person authorized by the court are the only ones that can now prefer directly. I can see no reason why we should not when possible interpret the law in compliance with this clear attitudinal trend on the part of Parliament. Furthermore, to say that an information is found only once a determination to issue a process is made is not inconsistent with the procedure by indictment.",

We are here unfortunately dealing with legal expressions which were developed in the grand jury system and as a result a certain degree of transposition is required. Under the grand jury system (which still exists inNova Scotia) a bill was preferred before the grand jury. If it found a true bill it presented the indictment to the court. Prior to a true bill the Attorney General could not under the common law stay the proceedings by entering anolle prosequi.The power to stay and limitation thereto were codified in this country in 1892 by s. 732: 732.The Attorney General may, at any time after an indictment has been found against any person for any offence and before judgment is given thereon, direct the officer of the court to make on the record an entry that the proceedings are stayed by his direction, and on such entry being made all such proceedings shall be stayed accordingly. [Page 157] 2. The Attorney-General may delegate such power in any particular court to any counsel nominated by him. The procedure by indictment where there is no grand jury in fact does away, though we still speak of preferring an indictment, with the two stages of preferral and presentment. \"There is but one act, that act being the placing by the appropriate authority of 'an indictment in writing setting forth the offence' before the trial court. This act constitutes the commencement of the trial and is a combination of the steps of preferral and presentment.\" Under this procedure the Attorney General makes the determination in the stead of the grand jury, and the next step is for the court to issue the process to bring the accused before the court to answer the charge. When the proceedings are commenced by an information the informant in a sense \"prefers\" the information and the Justice of the Peace decides whether or not to \"find\" the information and then the next step is to issue the process to bring the accused before him.",

The Attorney General's power to stay starts as of the moment a summons or warrant is issued. Though this approach is not without logic, I must admit that were it the only reason for adopting this course I should have to adopt the second reason advanced by the Court of Appeal and dismiss this appeal. Indeed the second observation made by the Court of Appeal cannot be discarded easily, and accordingly I have felt great hesitation in concluding that this appeal should be allowed. In fact, it is when addressing the third observation made by the Court of Appeal, (the Attorney General's historical control of the process), that I have preferred a policy consideration, desirable accountability, to the advantage of avoiding differ- [Page 158] ent approaches, one for indictable offences and the other for summary conviction offences. The disparity between stays for summary convictions and those for indictable offences is undesirable and could not have been intended by Parliament. Such an anomaly is not, unfortunately so infrequent in the field of criminal procedure. Our lexicon is archaic and no longer corresponds to current institutions. Our changing sections are unfortunately often the result of patchwork on the part of draughtsmen. Furthermore, it is difficult for the courts to inject some logic and cohesion in a system where, as regards the charging process, the exception has become over the years the rule, where the exceptional procedures of direct indictment without a grand jury for theNorthwest Territoriesis now, save inNova Scotia, the system for the whole country. When faced with the choice between uniformity of procedure and greater political accountability for the exercise of a necessary but no less dangerous discretion to circumvent the courts and deny a citizen his right to bring another to court, I think I should, pending Parliament's decision to speak out in modern terms, prefer the latter and suffer some anomaly in the law which I imagine is temporary.",

Throughout this period, the Liberal party was in power at the federal level. From 1963 until September 1968, Giguère was a director of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Since September 1968 Giguère has been a Senator. At the material times David Belhumeur was a chartered accountant and a businessman.

Jean Dionne was also a businessman, involved primarily in the food sector. Canadian Advertising Agency Limited (\"Canadian Advertising\") was an old French Canadian advertising agency that did work for the federal Liberals during elections. Publicor Ltd. held all of the outstanding shares of Canadian Advertising. In 1965 Canadian Advertising was in poor financial condition. The majority shareholder of Publicor, Arthur Fontaine, was terminally ill. He wanted to sell. His primary concern was to have Canadian Advertising continue as a French Canadian company. He was prepared to sell his interest in Publicor for $1, if the new purchasers would take over responsibility for a $100,000 bank overdraft. The minority shareholders of Publicor were also prepared to sell; their selling price was $22,500. In September 1965 the sale of Publicor, and hence Canadian Advertising, was completed. The purchasers were the three individual accused, Giguère, Belhumeur and Dionne, as well as one Léon Simard. Simard is an unindicted co-conspirator and one of the Crown's chief witnesses. The four new owners each paid $5,625 for the purchase of the minority shareholdings and each acquired 25 per cent of the shares of Publicor. The [Page 454] $100,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by Simard, Belhumeur and Dionne, but not by Giguère. No one was ever called upon to pay on the guarantee. A \"cash flow\" of $48,000 was put into Canadian Advertising by way of a loan. Simard loaned $12,000; the remaining $36,000 was loaned by a company called Air Food Caterers (AFC). From October 1965 onward AFC was a company owned 42.5 per cent by Belhumeur, 37.5 per cent by Dionne, and 20 per cent by Giguère. Although Giguère was initially listed on the records of Publicor as a shareholder, the records were changed shortly after the September 1965 acquisition. Thereafter, Giguère's shares were held by a nominee, Paul Boudreau, an unnamed co-conspirator and Crown witness. Boudreau had been a director and officer of Canadian Advertising; he was in charge of the day-to-day operations of Canadian Advertising from shortly before the takeover in 1965 until the spring of 1968, when he left Canadian Advertising. After the takeover in 1965, the financial position of Canadian Advertising improved considerably.",

    "text": "After the takeover in 1965, the financial position of Canadian Advertising improved considerably. A major part of this improvement resulted from contracts with the federal government. Giguère had contacts in the federal government of which the Canadian Advertising did make use. In late 1967 Giguère informed the other three shareholders that he wished to sell his shares in Publicor. Giguère wanted $100,000 for his quarter interest. Belhumeur, the accountant, did an evaluation, without taking account of goodwill, and concluded Giguère's shares were worth approximately $52,000. Belhumeur, Dionne and Simard offered $67,000, including $15,000 for goodwill. Giguère was not satisfied. It was finally agreed that Giguère would get $67,000, plus $5,000 a year for five years—a total of $92,000. The $5,000 a year was to be paid not by Belhumeur, Dionne and Simard, but by Canadian Advertising as either salary or expenses. Canadian Advertising would claim the salary or expenses as [Page 455] a deduction for income tax purposes, so the effective cost would be $2,500 a year rather than $5,000. These would not be legitimate company deductions, but, as the trial judge noted, the accused are not charged with conspiring to evade taxes. The $67,000 was actually paid to Giguère through Canadian Advertising. Canadian Advertising was shortly thereafter reimbursed by Simard and AFC. Belhumeur's and Dionne's two-thirds of the $67,000 was charged back to them by AFC. In the same transactions the loans to Canadian Advertising of $12,000 by Simard and $36,000 by AFC were retired. The $5,000 a year was paid in different ways. For about two years, Canadian Advertising paid a salary to Françoise Demers, Giguère's personal secretary. Demers was not an employee of Canadian Advertising. It is conceded that a salary was paid to Demers rather than to Giguère because Demers was in a lower tax bracket. Demers turned the money over to Giguère. The practice of paying a salary to Demers stopped after an inspection by the tax department. Thereafter, moneys were paid to Giguère by way of expenses. Over the five years, the amount paid by Canadian Advertising to Giguère, directly or indirectly, was approximately $25,000. There is uncontradicted evidence that Giguère, after the sale of his shares, arranged meetings between government officials and representatives of Canadian Advertising, and also that Giguère put in a good word for Canadian Advertising with at least one Cabinet Minister.",

Shortly after noon Mr. Droste, his wife and the children left for the party; the children were strapped in the back seat by the seat belts. Droste noticed the smell of gasoline when she entered the vehicle.En route,as the vehicle was approaching a bridge, flames began to shoot up between the two front seats. Mr. Droste attempted to extinguish them with his right hand. Droste testified that her husband then took a screwdriver from under his seat and began hitting her on the left side of the head, at the same time yelling at her to let go the steering wheel. The vehicle crashed into the bridge abutment. Mr. Droste fell forward on the steering wheel and was temporarily incapacitated. Droste got out through the door on the driver's side as the passenger door would not open; she helped her husband out of the vehicle. Mr. and Mrs. Droste tried to get the children out of the back seat of the car but were unable to do so. The children died from asphyxia due to smoke inhalation. Crown evidence was to the effect that four gallons of gasoline had been used out of the five gallon container found in the trunk of the car. In the opinion of the Crown's experts the fire did not [Page 211] start in the engine; it was caused by an accelerant used in the interior of the vehicle. The Crown adduced other damning evidence. A co-worker of Mr. Droste testified that Droste had been telling him of various plans to kill Mrs. Droste. The final plan involved crashing a motor vehicle into a tree, starting a fire inside the vehicle and leaving Mrs. Droste to die.",

Other co-workers gave evidence that Droste told them he was going to kill his wife. There was evidence that Mr. Droste was sexually involved with a married woman at the time of the occurrence and that he desired to collect the proceeds of an insurance policy recently placed on the life of Mrs. Droste. Mr. Droste was indicted on two charges, namely, first degree murder of each child. The trial judge instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Droste had planned and deliberated to kill his wife, then he could be convicted of the first degree murder of his children. In the absence of the jury he explained to counsel the basis of his charge: I am relying primarily on the wording of 214(2). There is no reference therein which would restrict the applicability to the intended victim, and I realize it is arguable, but it seems to me if a murder is established under 212(b) the planning and deliberation may relate to the murder of an intended victim whereas theactus rea[sic]relates to the unintended victim, otherwise you would never have first degree murder in circumstances where all the components are proven with reference to A and the unintended victim B, is killed. I am also of the view that this approach is consistent with the doctrine of transferred malice as outlined in Glanville Williams; The Criminal Law, the General part 2nd Edition, pages 125 to 137. It is a difficult problem and I appreciate the submission, but in putting the charge together I concluded that the element of planning and deliberation could be in relation to an intended victim when the charge was laid under 212(b). [Page 212] The jury returned a verdict of guilty on each charge. Mr. Droste appealed and the Court of Appeal forOntarioheld that the trial judge had correctly charged the jury. The sole question in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal was correct in so holding.",

Mr. Ogg-Moss was employed at the Regional Centre as an M.R.C. He argues that by virtue of this position, his relationship with Mr. Henderson was that of \"a person standing in the place of a parent\" or of a \"schoolteacher\" using reasonable force to \"correct\" a \"child\" or \"pupil\" in his charge. He claims therefore the protection of s. 43. Mental Retardation Counsellors are the \"frontline direct care staff in provincial facilities for the developmentally handicapped. Their duties are set out in Regulations and Directives made pursuant to theDevelopmental Services Act,R.S.O. 1980, c. 118. These duties include providing daily care for the residents of such facilities and implementing programs designed and supervised by physicians, psychologists and other more senior professional personnel. On the day in question Mr. Ogg-Moss was supervising a group of residents in a low grade ward. The residents, including Mr. Henderson, were seated at tables awaiting lunch. Mr. Henderson was described in evidence at trial as \"very low functioning\" and \"profoundly retarded\" with an I.Q. of less than 20. He was incapable of speech and, as a result of being a \"head-banger\" suffered from a large haemotoma on his forehead. In an apparent attempt to attract Mr. Ogg-Moss's attention, Mr. Henderson spilled his milk on the table before him, whereupon Mr. Ogg-Moss shouted \"no\" and struck Mr. Henderson five times on the forehead with a large metal spoon for the purpose, according to his later testimony, \"of punishing him for what he did\". [Page 177] The incident was reported by a summer student at the Rideau Regional Centre. It was her testimony that Mr. Henderson did not cry out as a result of being struck but appeared \"quite startled\". She felt that had she been hit with that force she would have cried. In his evidence, in response to a question as to Mr. Henderson's reaction to the blows, Mr. Ogg-Moss replied \"Kentcan't speak but he gives this guttural sound and he did give a cry when I hit him\". Mr. Ogg-Moss stated further that five minutes after being hit with the spoon, Mr. Henderson would be incapable of remembering the incident.",

    "text": "The facts giving rise to the problem are that the appellant, the owner of a boarding house inToronto, failed to comply with the City's fire prevention by-law with respect to fire extinguishers, smoke detectors and fire escapes. The boarding house burned down on October 5, 1980 and four people died in the fire. The Crown alleged that this loss of life would not have occurred if the appellant had complied with the by-law. The appellant appeared before Graburn Co. Ct. J. charged on the following indictment: SAEID ABBAS stands charged that he, on or about the 5th day of October in the year 1980, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, caused a fire at 24 Caroline Avenue by violating a law in force at 24 Caroline Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, to wit: City of Toronto By-Law #73/68, which fire resulted in the death of Frederick James Narapecka and Ernie Cullen and Arthur Burton and Herbert Rose, contrary to the Criminal Code. Rather than adducing proof of the Crown's case and then arguing the legal issues on a defence motion to dismiss, the parties requested the court to rule as a preliminary matter on the legal issue of whether the \"deeming\" provision of s. 392(2) of theCriminal Codeapplies on a charge under s. 392(1)(b). Although Judge Graburn was not completely satisfied with this procedure, he complied with the request and, following the decision of Borins Co. Ct. J. inR. v. Alter(1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 381, ruled that it did not. The appellant was then arraigned; the Crown which had proposed to rely on the \"deeming\" provision conceded that it had no evidence to offer, and the appellant was acquitted. The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal which reversed Judge Graburn and ordered a new trial. The appellant filed notice of appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 618(2)(a) of theCode.Accordingly there has not yet been an adjudication on the merits. [Page 531] Section 392 forms part of Part IX of theCodeentitled \"Wilful and Forbidden Acts in respect of Certain Property\". Both \"property\" and \"wilfulness\" are defined terms for purposes of this part of theCode,the definitions being contained in ss. 385 and 386(1) respectively.",

It seems clear therefore that s. 392(2) applies to a charge laid under s. 392(1)(a). In the present case, however, the indictment does not allege that the appellant \"wilfully\" caused a fire. It alleges that he \"caused a fire\" by \"violating a law in force\". It can be a good indictment, therefore, only in respect of an offence under s. 392(1)(b). Ironically, the appellant would not seem to have a case if the indictment had charged him with \"wilfully\" causing a fire even though it is apparent that in the ordinary sense of the word his action or inaction was neither wilful nor a cause of the fire.",

    "text": "A.Gibson [35]Mr. Gibson was charged with operating a vehicle while having over 80 mg, contrary tos. 253(b) of theCriminal Code. At trial in the Nova Scotia Provincial Court, the arresting officer testified that he saw Mr. Gibson driving his all-terrain vehicle on the highway, that he stopped him at 8:59 p.m. on July 13, 2003, that Mr. Gibson's breath smelled of alcohol, and that his speech was slurred. The officer administered two breathalyzer tests, which indicated that Mr. Gibson's blood alcohol content was 120 mg at 10:12 p.m. and 100 mg at 10:21 p.m. [36]Mr. Gibson testified that he had consumed ten beers over a period of seven hours on the day in question and had consumed five of them shortly before being stopped by the police. His testimony was corroborated by another witness. An expert witness for the defence testified that, assuming that the pattern of consumption attested to by Mr. Gibson and the corroborating witness was accurate and based on the average alcohol elimination rates of men of Mr. Gibson's age, height and weight, Mr. Gibson would have had a blood alcohol content of between 40 and 105 mg at 8:59 p.m., when he was stopped by the police. [37]The trial judge accepted both the evidence of Mr. Gibson's consumption and the expert evidence. He held that the evidence that Mr. Gibson's blood alcohol content would have been between 40 and 105 mg at the time he last operated the vehicle was evidence to the contrary that rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(d.1). The trial judge was left with a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gibson's blood alcohol content had exceeded the legal limit, and acquitted him ((2004), 225 N.S.R. (2d) 16, 2004 NSPC 40). [38]The Nova Scotia Supreme Court upheld the acquittal despite the Crown's submission that expert evidence based on elimination rates in the general population could not constitute evidence to the contrary ((2004), 227 N.S.R.

    "text": "The court held that, since it is practically impossible for an accused to accurately determine his or her elimination rate at the time of the alleged offence, to reject evidence of elimination rates in the general population would amount to making the presumption in s. 258(1)(d.1) an irrebuttable one, which could lead to false convictions. [39]The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial ((2006), 243 N.S.R. (2d) 325, 2006 NSCA 51). It cited this Court's decision inR. v. Boucher, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 499, 2005 SCC 72, for the proposition that an expert opinion based on average tendencies of the population is without foundation and thus inadmissible. Therefore, the Court of Appeal held that the Nova Scotia Supreme Court had erred in finding that evidence of a hypothetical person's elimination rates was capable of rebutting the presumption in s. 258(1)(d.1). B.MacDonald [40]Like Mr. Gibson, Mr. MacDonald was charged with operating a vehicle while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 mg, contrary tos. 253(b) of theCriminal Code. On February 26, 2003, he was stopped at a check stop, where a police officer noted that Mr. MacDonald smelled of alcohol, was talking in a deliberate manner and had some difficulty in walking. Two breath tests produced identical readings of 146 mg, which were rounded down to 140 mg for purposes of the charge. [41]Mr. MacDonald testified that he had consumed six cans of beer over four and a half hours and had consumed the last can five minutes before being stopped by the police. A friend corroborated this evidence. [42]At trial, Mr. MacDonald adduced expert evidence that, according to a test conducted several months after he was charged, his elimination rate was 18.5 mg per hour and that, assuming he had eliminated alcohol at the same rate on the night of the alleged offence, his blood alcohol content would have been 71 mg_below the legal limit_at the relevant time. In testing Mr. MacDonald's elimination rate, the expert did not attempt to recreate the conditions on the night Mr. MacDonald was charged as regards the type and pattern of alcohol consumption and the amount of food consumed.",

Instead, the expert had Mr. MacDonald drink a mix of Diet Seven‐Up and vodka over a period of five minutes until he reached a target range of between 50 and 60 mg. The expert then plotted Mr. MacDonald's blood alcohol readings on a chart. In addition to testifying that Mr. MacDonald's blood alcohol content would have been 71 mg, the expert stated that a man of Mr. MacDonald's age, height and weight who eliminated alcohol at an average rate would have had a blood alcohol content of 64 to 109 mg at the relevant time. [43]The trial judge convicted Mr. MacDonald on the basis that the expert evidence did not tend to show that his blood alcohol content had not exceeded 80 mg (2003 CarswellAlta 1986). In his opinion, Mr. MacDonald's alcohol elimination rate according to the expert's test did not raise a reasonable doubt, because it did not reflect the type of alcohol or the amount of food consumed, and the expert had testified that these factors would influence a person's elimination rate. The trial judge also noted that, based on elimination rates in the general population, the midpoint of the range of blood alcohol levels was 86.5 mg, which is over the legal limit. [44]The Alberta Court of Queen's Bench upheld the conviction for the reason that the \"straddle evidence\"_that is, evidence of a range of possible blood alcohol levels lying both below and above the legal limit_was speculative and was not probative of Mr. MacDonald's blood alcohol content at the time of the offence ((2004), 47 Alta. L.R. (4th) 242, 2004 ABQB 629). The court added that to rebut the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c), (d.1) and (g), an accused must adduce evidence that would \"eliminate a scenario whereby the accused's blood‐alcohol level is over 80 [mg] at the time of driving\" . [45]The Alberta Court of Appeal agreed, relying in part onBoucher.It stated thatevidence of blood alcohol content that disregards the personal characteristics of the accused at the time of the alleged offence constitutes an attack on the fictional nature of the presumption and is inadmissible.",

During the 15-minute drive to the Maison des jeunes, the accused allegedly touched the complainant's breasts, put his finger inside her vagina and said [translation] \"That smells good\" (A.R., at p. 137). The complainant further alleged that Mr. Dinardo invited her to touch his penis, which she refused. [4]The complainant, who was 22 years old at the time of trial, is mildly mentally challenged and suffers from Tourette syndrome. When the alleged incident occurred, she was residing at the Auberge during the week. It was common for residents of the home to visit the Maison des jeunes for activities during the day. As a general rule, residents were transported back and forth in taxis. [5]When the complainant arrived at the Maison des jeunes, she spontaneously recounted the alleged events to a teacher. When she returned to the Auberge that afternoon, she made a similar statement to an employee of the home. The taxi driver who dropped off the complainant witnessed this statement. Later that day, the complainant told the same story to a second employee of the home.

During the course of her testimony on thevoir dire, the complainant contradicted herself on the question of whether she knew what it meant to tell the truth. She first stated that she did not understand the importance of telling the truth. She subsequently testified that she knew what it meant to lie and that lying was wrong. She stated that if she did not remember the answer to a question, she would simply say [translation]\"I don't remember\" (A.R., at pp. 110-11).

The complainant provided inconsistent answers on the frequency with which she told these types of stories, but said that her foster family reprimanded her when she did so. [8]In response to defence counsel's argument that it was apparent that [translation] \"she can be made to say almost anything\" (A.R., at p. 123), the trial judge held that while the complainant's deficiency was apparent, it did not mean that she could not testify and it would be up to him to determine her credibility. He therefore ruled that the complainant was competent to testify on a promise to tell the truth. No issue is raised with respect to this ruling; however, the obvious difficulties demonstrated during the course of the complainant'svoir diretestimony and the trial judge's acknowledgement that any issue of credibility would have to be ultimately resolved by him at trial provide relevant context for assessing the sufficiency of the trial judge's reasons on appellate review.

When she was being untruthful, she would blush or confuse what she was saying. On this occasion, however, the complainant had repeated the same story several times to different people. For this reason, Ms. Duquette believed that the complainant was being truthful. Both witnesses also testified that the complainant's behaviour on the date of the alleged offence was out of character. [14]Mr. Dinardo testified and denied the allegations against him. He stated that when he arrived at the Auberge, the complainant was brought out to the taxi and an employee of the home fastened her seatbelt. The employee placed the complainant's hands between her legs to prevent her from hitting herself or the cab driver because of her condition.

After recalling the test inR. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, and the Crown's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge made his findings on credibility. He stated that while the accused had [translation] \"testified well\" , he did not believe the accused's \"argument\" that [translation] \"it was impossible for him to touch the passenger because of the console, the coffee cup and his note book\" .",

[17]The trial judge then considered the complainant's credibility. He did not refer to the evidence that the complainant, by her own admission, had a tendency to lie. Rather, he observed only that [translation] \"[w]hen cross-examined by counsel for the accused, she never contradicted herself on important facts, only on certain details that the Court does not consider important enough for the contradictions to affect her credibility\" . He placed significant emphasis on the fact that the complainant's version of the events was consistent, noting that [translation] \"in this case, there is a form of corroboration in the facts and statements of the victim, who never contradicted herself\" . He also noted that the complainant's statement was made spontaneously upon her arrival at the Maison des jeunes. The accused was convicted of both offences. [18]A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal: [2007] Q.J. No. 1320 (QL), 2007 QCCA 287. Rochon J.A., Côté J.A. concurring, held that although the trial judge's reasons were succinct, they made it clear why the trial judge disbelieved Mr. Dinardo. While the trial judge did not explicitly direct himself on the second step ofW. (D.), the test is not a [translation] \"sacrosanct formula\" . It was implicit in the trial judge's rejection of the accused's evidence that his evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt. While it may have been preferable to state this explicitly, his failure to do so was not an error of law. [19]The majority then observed that the complainant's testimony should be evaluated having regard to her mental disability. Rochon J.A. reviewed ten inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence identified by Mr. Dinardo, including the complainant's testimony about inventing stories. None of these inconsistencies were specifically addressed by the trial judge. Rochon J.A. concluded that the inconsistencies related primarily to peripheral aspects of the case.",

With respect to the complainant's testimony about telling stories, the majority stated that [translation] \"[e]ven if I were to conclude that this last piece of evidence required an explanation by the judge, a review of the evidence on these questions would enable a court of appeal to review the soundness of the decision\" . [20]The majority also held that the trial judge erred in using the complainant's prior consistent statements to corroborate her evidence that a crime had been committed. The majority concluded, however, that the improper use of the statements did not justify ordering a new trial because the accused suffered no prejudice. [21]Chamberland J.A., in dissent, noted that despite stating twice that the accused had [translation] \"testified well\", the trial judge found Mr. Dinardo guilty without explaining why he rejected Mr. Dinardo's denial of guilt. Although he explained why he disbelieved Mr. Dinardo's evidence that he could not have touched the complainant because of the configuration of his car, the trial judge did not discuss the most important aspect of Mr. Dinardo's testimony — that is, his denial of the allegations. [22]Chamberland J.A. also concluded that the trial judge erred in failing to explicitly consider the second step of theW. (D.)test — even if he did not believe the \"argument\" of the accused, he failed to consider whether he was left in reasonable doubt by the accused's testimony. There was no corroborating evidence in the case and the complainant's testimony was problematic. Chamberland J.A. was particularly concerned about the exchange at the end of the complainant's cross‐examination in which she stated that she invented the allegations [translation] \"to say he touched me\" . Chamberland J.A. noted that more than one witness testified that the complainant had a history of lying. In the circumstances, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to explicitly address the accused's denial of the allegations. Chamberland J.A. would have ordered a new trial.",

[112]On December 13, 2003, D.B., who was 17 at the time, went to a shopping mall in Hamilton with some friends. They began exchanging insults with another group of young men and two of them decided to fight. When the fight between those two began outside the mall, D.B. turned to Jonathan Romero and said \"Me and you are going to fight right now\". Romero said \"No\". Romero was watching the others fight with his arms down at his sides when D.B. punched him on the right side of his neck and face area. The punch was described as a \"sucker punch\" meaning that Romero was neither prepared nor ready for the punch. Romero fell to the ground from the force of D.B.'s punch. D.B. then continued the assault by jumping on top of Romero and punching him four more times on the face and neck. Romero was knocked unconscious and unable to defend himself. [113]D.B. then fled back towards the shopping mall. The two other combatants stopped fighting and, along with three employees of a nearby store, came to the aid of the victim. An ambulance was called. When it arrived, Romero had no vital signs. Romero later died of his injuries. [114]Inside the shopping mall, D.B. was heard to say: \"You missed it, it was one punch, the guy's not even fuckin' moving.\" D.B. changed his clothes in a nearby restaurant, stowed the old clothes in a knapsack and gave the knapsack to another person. He then went to the home of one of his friends, talking about the fight on the way. Later that evening, D.B. went to a nightclub. He left with some friends in a taxi around closing time. [115]In the taxi, D.B. learned via cellular telephone that Romero had died. He stayed the night at the home of one of his friends. When the police arrived at the friend's home the following morning, D.B. attempted to flee out the back door, but was subsequently caught and arrested. [116]D.B. pleaded guilty and was convicted of manslaughter.",

[116]D.B. pleaded guilty and was convicted of manslaughter. He made an application to receive a youth sentence, which was opposed by the Crown. [117]D.B. had had frequent physical altercations with peers and had been suspended from high school numerous times, primarily for disruptive behaviour, verbal aggression, and disrespectful and intimidating conduct towards school staff. At the time of the offence, D.B. was bound by two separate probation orders, arising out of prior convictions for possession of stolen property and robbery. Both offences involved threats and intimidation. While he was in custody awaiting disposition and sentence for manslaughter, D.B. was involved in several assaultive incidents with other inmates and staff members (see Predisposition Assessment, Appellant's Record, at pp. 184-85). [118]As a result of the Crown opposing his youth sentence application, D.B. challenged the constitutionality of the presumptive offence provisions of theYCJA. The sentencing judge allowed theCharterchallenge ((2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 605 (S.C.J.)). He imposed a youth sentence of 30 months in a juvenile correctional facility. The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown's appeal, holding that the presumptive offence provisions violateds. 7of theCharterand were not saved under s. 1 ((2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 698).",

    "text": "[2]The respondent was the stepfather of the complainant. The complainant testified that the respondent, who lived in the same house along with her sister and their mother, started sexually abusing her when she was approximately four years old. The abuse went on consistently, and intensified from touching to intercourse as she got older (A.R., at pp. 142-45). When she was eight-and-a-half years old and again when she was almost 15, the complainant told her mother about the assault, but the mother did not believe her on either occasion, at least initially. Eventually, the mother told the respondent to leave the house. At the age of 15, the complainant went to the police. [3]The complainant's mother testified that when the complainant was about 13, she began to hang around with a rough crowd that was breaking into houses and mailboxes. She was smoking, drinking, had a lot of problems with her teachers and the principal at school, and rebelled at everything. According to her sister, the complainant went from being \"kind of a good little apple to a bad apple\" as she got older (A.R., at p. 358). The sister described the relationship between her mother and the complainant as \"very rocky\", and living with them as \"sheer chaos\" (A.R., at p. 362). [4]The accused denied all allegations of impropriety. The defence theory was that the complainant began to act up when her biological father first came back into her life when she was about 11 years old. Shortly afterwards he again ceased contact with her. The complainant felt rejected. In response to her uncontrollable behaviour, the respondent threatened to send her to a Catholic school, which the defence says prompted her false allegations of sexual assault (A.R., at pp. 126-27).",

There had been a history of animosity between the appellant and Leach. Leach was stabbed sixteen times and died as a result of these injuries. Later that same day, the appellant was arrested on a charge of first degree murder in connection with Leach's death. The appellant was detained in custody until September 13, 1982, at which time he was granted judicial interim release. The preliminary hearing was held in part on January 12 and 13, 1983, and was continued and concluded four months later on May 9 and 19, 1983 when the original two days scheduled in January proved insufficient to complete the inquiry. The appellant was committed to stand trial on the charge of first degree murder. On June 24, 1983, the trial was adjourned on consent until December 5, 1983 to deal with the appellant's application to quash the committal for first degree murder. The application was dismissed, and on September 13, 1983 the trial date of December 6, 1983 was confirmed. Shortly thereafter, almost 16 months after the charge, on December 15, 1983, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of first degree murder but guilty of the lesser included offence of second degree murder. The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility of parole for ten years. The appellant was represented at this trial by Mr. Leonard Shore. The appellant launched an appeal of his conviction which was heard in December 1984. The appellant was represented by Mr. Brian Greenspan. On January 24, 1985, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal partly on the grounds that the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury relating to provocation. A new trial was ordered. The appellant was in custody for over thirteen months between December 14, 1983 and February 1, 1985. On the later date he was released on bail. The appellant appeared in Assignment Court on March 4, 1985 and, upon adjournment, again on June 25, 1985, at which time a date for the second trial was set for January 7, 1986.",

On November 15, 1985, counsel who had represented the appellant during his first trial, Mr. Shore, brought an application to be removed from the record. The appellant was in the process of retaining Mr. Greenspan to conduct the second trial. Mr. Shore's application was refused by Osborne J. due to a concern that new counsel would be unable to prepare by January 7, 1986. However, Mr. Shore applied again on December 5, 1985, and this time his application to be removed from the record was granted by Osborne J. On December 10, 1985, Osborne J. further directed that the trial was to proceed on January 7, 1986. This left the appellant one month to obtain new counsel before the second trial. Conway did not succeed in obtaining new counsel and appeared unrepresented at the scheduled start of his second trial on January 7, 1986. The appellant gave Osborne J. at this time a list of 11 criminal lawyers including Mr. Greenspan who had stated they could not take the case due to the short time before the trial date. Although the Crown and the court expressed some concern at the delay, the matter was adjourned to April 21, 1986 in order to allow the appellant to retain new counsel. The second trial began on April 21, 1986 with Mr. Greenspan acting as counsel for the appellant. On May 1, 1986, after two days of deliberations, the jury failed to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. The matter again came up in Assignment Court on May 26, 1986. The appellant was unrepresented but a lawyer from Mr. Shore's office spoke on his behalf. Mr. Greenspan had indicated to the accused that it would not be possible for him to act as counsel again in proceedings held in Ottawa. There was an adjournment until June 16, 1986 in order to enable the appellant to attend with counsel to fix a date for the third trial. At that time, although Mr. Shore spoke on his behalf, the appellant still had not retained counsel. A trial date was nevertheless set for September 22, 1986.",

A change of venue application to move the proceedings to Toronto brought by Mr. Greenspan was dismissed on August 8, 1986. After the second trial the appellant applied for assistance under the Ontario Legal Aid Plan. This application had been made prior to the appellant's appearance on June 16, 1986 to set a date for trial. However, Conway had not been granted Legal Aid by the time of the June 16 appearance. After being refused twice, the appellant was finally granted Legal Aid on certain financial conditions in July of 1986. On the date set for the third trial, September 22, 1986, the appellant sought an adjournment as he had not been successful in retaining new counsel. The request was granted over the objection of the Crown and the trial was set for November 10, 1986. On October 2, 1986, the accused brought an application to adjourn the trial date as Donald Bayne, the new counsel, was only able to represent the appellant if an adjournment were granted. The application was denied. A further application was brought on November 4, 1986 and it was also denied. From mid-September until the end of October 1986 at least seven criminal lawyers were approached to represent the appellant at his scheduled trial of November 10, 1986. Affidavits from these lawyers were filed indicating their inability to represent the appellant at this short notice. On further application, O'Brien J. ordered that the trial not proceed until immediately after the disposition of another unrelated murder trial which was set to commence on November 17, 1986.

Callon J. felt it best to await the decision of the Court of Appeal. Subsequently, at the June 1, 1987 Assignment Court the date of October 26, 1987 was set for the third trial. At the onset of the third trial, on October 26, 1987, the appellant appeared before Smith J. and entered a plea of not guilty on the charge of murder but guilty on the lesser included offence of manslaughter. The plea was not accepted by the Crown because the appellant would not agree to a joint submission for a sentence of 15 years. The appellant consequently brought an application to stay on the basis that holding a third trial in the circumstances would constitute an abuse of process and, as well, on the basis that in view of the time elapsed since the beginning of these proceedings, there had been a violation of his right to be tried within a reasonable time guaranteed bys. 11(b)of theCharter. The appellant was incarcerated for a period of thirteen and a half months including the period immediately after his arrest and after the first trial prior to the Court of Appeal's decision. While on bail the appellant was subject to several restrictions including a provision that he not reside at his family home in Barrhaven. He was also required to report to the Manotick detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police on a weekly basis. As well, the length and number of proceedings over five years required that the appellant appear in court for two trials, one appeal and frequently for the purpose of obtaining trial dates and adjournments. The appellant adduced evidence demonstrating that he suffered from stress, anxiety and stigmatization as a result of the delay. The uncertainty which he faced was exacerbated by the length of the delay. The delay resulted in the continued disruption of the appellant's family life and social life. His education was disrupted and his health suffered. The defence put forward by the appellant was self-defence and provocation.",

The cinema was a typical picture theatre showing motion picture films to members of the public who paid an admission fee. On January 25 to 27, 1980 the accused was regularly presenting showings of a motion picture calledDracula Sucks. The film had been given a \"Restricted\" rating by the Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. A copy of the motion picture was seized by the Edmonton City Police on January 27, 1980, after the public showing on that date and before the scheduled second public showing. The accused was charged and tried before a justice of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. Three witnesses testified. 3.Staff Sergeant Ashworth of the Edmonton City Police said he had attended and observed the film and it was he who had taken possession of the film. The Court then adjourned to the Censor Board film theatre where the trial judge viewed the film. At the resumption of the trial, Ashworth testified that on January 21, 1980, the film had been showing at the Capitol Square Cinema, before being transferred to the Jasper Cinema. While at the former theatre Ashworth had received about five phone calls from persons complaining about the film. In cross‐examination he was asked: Did you find the movie very offensive to yourself? He replied: Yeah, I thought it was disgusting. That's only my personal... The film itself and the evidence of Staff Sergeant Ashworth constituted the case for the Crown. 4.The defence called two witnesses. The first was Terrance Yushchyshyn, Director of Operations for the theatres operated by the accused company in the five westerly provinces. His evidence in summary was as follows. Prior to being booked into his theatre in Edmonton, the film, the subject of the present charge, had been shown at two Famous Players' Theatres, one in Edmonton, where it had been seen by 4065 persons and one in Calgary, where it had been seen by 4075 persons. The film was then moved to the Jasper Cinema where it was seen, before seizure, by 555 people, without complaints. In Mr. Yushchyshyn's opinion the impugned film was \"verypassé\", \"boring and dull\".",

The Board arrives at appropriate classification for a movie consistent with the Board's interpretation of current community standards of acceptance. Compared to other movies he had seen, Mr. Hooper describedDracula Sucksas \"pretty forgettable\". The Board had received no complaints regarding this particular film. During the preceding year, the Board viewed 750 films and rejected twelve, because it was felt that adult Albertans would generally repudiate them. The basis for the Board's assessment of community standards has shifted during the preceding ten years: now, \"it's contemporary, it's modern, it must be Canadian\". Mr. Hooper succinctly describedDracula Sucks: \"Well, it has nudity in it, it has violence in it, it has simulated sex encounters in it.\" 6.The trial judge found the film to be immoral, indecent and obscene. It possessed \"absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever\"; \"most of the film was devoted to extreme, tasteless violence and explicit, unnecessary sex\". 7.The accused company was convicted and fined $1500.",

    "text": "On June 18, 1983 the appellant and his wife separated after a 3-year marriage which produced two children, a son Michael aged 5 and a daughter Tracey aged 4. The appellant also had a step-son John aged 11. By agreement with his wife, Corrine Provo, the appellant was allowed access to his children and his step-son on the weekends while she retained permanent custody. During these weekend visits the children stayed at the appellant's residence in Winnipeg, Manitoba. When the visits started in June, 1983 the sleeping arrangements were that the appellant slept alone in a single bed in his bedroom and the two younger children, Michael and Tracey, slept in a double bed in the same room. The older child, John, slept on a couch in the living room. Some time before December, 1984 this arrangement was changed and the appellant and his daughter Tracey slept in the double bed while Michael slept in the single. The explanation given for this change was that Michael and Tracey could not sleep peacefully in the same bed. On December 26, 1984 Corrine Provo confronted the appellant with an allegation that he was sexually molesting his daughter Tracey after Tracey had complained to her. The appellant replied that he had an erection while sleeping in the same bed as Tracey and that Tracey had wakened him up complaining. The appellant denied any intentional wrongdoing and offered to see a counsellor with his wife if necessary. On January 4, 1985 Tracey was examined at the Children's Hospital by a pediatrician who found that the child's vaginal opening was twice the normal size and that there was a healed laceration in the child's hymen. The police were contacted and the appellant was arrested at his home the next day. The appellant was charged with committing incest by having sexual intercourse with his daughter contrary to s. 150 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as amended, and with sexually assaulting her contrary to s. 246.1 of theCriminal Code. These charges proceeded by way of indictment and the appellant was tried on September 12 and 13, 1985 in the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba. The appellant was convicted of incest and acquitted of sexual assault because of the application of the rule against multiple convictions.",

    "text": "The two counts of sexual assault against the appellant arose out of separate incidents in July 1985. The complainant, G.D., testified that on July 1, the appellant fondled her breasts while on an excursion to a park and later that same day, molested her in his apartment. Approximately three weeks later, again in his apartment, the appellant is alleged to have fondled her vagina through her clothing. The complainant had her 17th birthday shortly before this incident. She had been living with her mother, E.D., and two younger sisters since the appellant left the matrimonial home on May 30, 1981. On that date, E.D. discovered the appellant in bed with the complainant. At trial, it was common ground that no sexual assault occurred on that date. The appellant denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. Shortly after the commencement of the trial, avoir direwas held to determine the admissibility of evidence of alleged previous acts of sexual misconduct by the appellant against the complainant. The Crown wished to present the complainant's allegations of numerous incidents of sexual fondling and intercourse from December 1978 to May 1981, and further incidents of sexual touching in December 1983 and spring 1985. The appellant had faced several charges, including incest, arising from the incidents alleged prior to May 1981, however in 1982, the Crown had entered a stay of proceedings on all of these charges. The Crown also wished to adduce evidence of a June 1981 medical examination of the complainant. Counsel for the defence did not object to the admission of the allegations of incidents in December 1983 and spring 1985, nor to the evidence of the events on May 30, 1981. Defence counsel did object, however, to the admission of the evidence of incidents alleged to have occurred prior to May 1981, and the medical evidence. The trial judge ruled that the evidence of the alleged incidents prior to May 30, 1981 should be excluded. Low Co. Ct. J. was of the opinion that there was an insufficient logical connection between this evidence and the July 1985 incidents which gave rise to the charges before him. Even if the evidence of the alleged incidents prior to May 30, 1981 were relevant to the present charges, its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.",

In making this ruling, Low Co. Ct. J. warned that the excluded evidence might become admissible as a result of questions asked in cross-examination of Crown witnesses, or as a result of defence evidence. The medical evidence was excluded as not relevant. The trial resumed with E.D. testifying as a witness for the Crown. In cross-examination, defence counsel posed numerous probing questions about the state of family relations both prior to and after May 30, 1981. When defence counsel suggested that E.D. attempted to extract money from the appellant's mother in the summer of 1981, the following exchange took place: WitnessI don't believe so. I remember getting into an argument with her about money, but I don't believe I specifically asked her for money. CounselAnd did you not, in the course of that argument over money, in the summer of 1981 -- WitnessAnd it must have been later than the summer, because I had to be subpoenaed to go to Court on charges of incest against [L.E.D.] Following this unexpected response, defence counsel did not move that the proceedings be declared a mistrial; instead, counsel cross-examined further on the events surrounding the incest charge in order to minimize the damage caused. Before this Court, counsel for the appellant agreed that this questioning simply exacerbated an unfortunate situation. Following an adjournment, defence counsel did move for a mistrial. The trial judge refused this motion since, in his opinion, the situation was created by the defence. He found that defence counsel's cross-examination would leave the jury with the erroneous impression that the incest charge arose out of the events of May 30, 1981 and was stayed because the complainant's allegation against her father was false. Low Co. Ct. J. then ruled that the complainant's allegations of acts of sexual misconduct by the appellant prior to May 30, 1981 were admissible in order to correct that erroneous impression, and to allow the complainant \"to tell her entire story\". He did not, however, change his ruling as to the medical evidence.",

    "text": "The facts leading to this case may be summarized as follows. The appellant was residing with his mother, Alice Bieber, at her home in Windsor, Ontario. On the eve of the incident, when Mrs. Bieber went to bed, the appellant had gone out. Early the next morning, Mrs. Bieber found that her car, which she had left parked in the driveway, was missing. She assumed that the appellant had taken it. The appellant told her he had not taken the car and told her to call the police. Shortly thereafter, two uniformed officers attended at her home informing Mrs. Bieber that her car had been recovered earlier that night in a damaged condition. She indicated to the police that perhaps her son knew something about the car. The events that took place after this first conversation lasted less than five minutes. One of the officers started questioning the appellant but the latter immediately became upset and aggressive, verbally abusing the two officers, accusing them of trespassing and ordering them to get off the property. At that moment, Mrs. Bieber stepped in between her son and the officers and tried without success to persuade her son to go back to bed as she felt that he was drunk and belligerent. The appellant ignored his mother's request and persisted in demanding that the officers leave the house, threatening that he would get them out of the house if they did not leave by themselves. At this point, the appellant ran into the living room where there was a gun rack holding several guns. He grabbed one 12-gauge shotgun from the rack. Both officers, aware of the presence of the guns, tried to draw their guns but in their haste and confusion experienced difficulty in doing so and hurriedly left the house, exiting in opposite directions. A very short time later, the appellant came out of the house without the gun, and in vulgar language continued to exhort the police officers to leave. He indicated that he did not have a gun. He was immediately arrested on a charge of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 85 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.",

    "text": "The Crown alleges that on April 30, 1986 S.H.M. and J.E.L. accompanied a wealthy male of about fifty years of age to a store to rent two \"adult\" movies and then to his home. The man, a homosexual, was known to the youths. There is some evidence the man may have attempted sexual relations with J.E.L., whereupon J.E.L. struck the man in the head and stomach, rendering him unconscious. It is alleged that the youths then bound the man with electrical wire and strangled him with such force that a bone in his neck was broken. He died from asphyxiation by strangulation. The youths are alleged to have then taken the body to the basement of the house where they attempted to conceal it in a piece of carpet. They continued to reside in the victim's house at least until May 2, 1986 whilst commencing the wholesale disposition of the victim's stereo and computer equipment. The body was not found until two weeks later as a consequence of attempts by the owner of the video store to find out why the deceased had not returned the videos. A coroner placed the death on or about May 1, 1986. S.H.M. was l7 years and 11 months old at the time of the alleged offence. He had a prior conviction for two counts of gross indecency involving two male children aged 9 and 10 years respectively, for which he had received a suspended sentence with three years' probation. His childhood appears to have been a difficult one. His father was a chronic alcoholic who left home when S.H.M. was 7 or 8 years old. S.H.M. claims that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by an older brother over a three-year period when he was 7 to l0 years old. A pre-disposition report prepared in 1984 when he faced the charges of gross indecency suggests that this experience severely traumatized S.H.M. and may have contributed to the acts which gave rise to his conviction. S.H.M. left home at a relatively early age, although there is some dispute between the appellant and his mother as to exactly when he did leave; he claims he was thrown out when he was 11 years old, while she states that he left of his own volition when he was 15.",

    "text": "Part of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate history of his early years stems from his having a \"tendency to deceit or exaggeration\" related to attempts to gain sympathy. S.H.M.'s pre-disposition report quotes his mother as stating that S.H.M. is no longer welcome in the family home and she is not prepared to support him emotionally or financially in the future. S.H.M. has been the subject of several studies and reports by psychiatrists, social workers and psychologists. The general picture that emerges is that of an extremely self-conscious, insecure young man. Laycraft C.J.A. in the Alberta Court of Appeal described him thus: \"He is shy, introverted, self conscious, easily hurt and perceives himself to be isolated and disliked by his teachers and his peers\". He has also been described as \"passive\", and \"more a follower than a leader\". Testing reveals his IQ to be at 84 which is \"low average\" or \"dull normal\". While his physical age at the time of the offence was almost eighteen, emotionally he is described as being thirteen or fourteen. The report prepared by the defence psychiatrist found that S.H.M. had a \"predominantly neurotic personality, having feelings of inferiority, being insecure and unassertive, and hiding his feelings\"; he is also seen as \"pessimistic and possibly suicidal\". A social history prepared by the Edmonton John Howard Society stated that adult prison \"will be destructive for this young person\" and that \"[t]he combination of his immaturity, sexual identity confusion, and exaggerated need for approval by others will be disastrous for him in the prison culture\".",

    "text": "The facts giving rise to the charges have been set out in my reasons inR. v. M. (S.H.)and need not be repeated. Suffice it to say that the circumstances alleged by the Crown, if proven, establish the commission of a heinous offence in callous manner. Separate charges were laid against each of the young offenders, and each proceeded independently. In the case of J.E.L., as with S.H.M., the Youth Court judge declined to order transfer to ordinary court. The Court of Queen's Bench upheld that ruling. The Court of Appeal overturned it, ordering J.E.L. to stand trial in ordinary court. J.E.L. now appeals to this Court. The background of J.E.L. was troubled. At the time of the alleged offences, J.E.L. was 17 years, 6 months of age. He had prior convictions for theft over $200 and mischief, for each of which he was sentenced to six months' probation. The pre-disposition report describes J.E.L. as enjoying a stable and close relationship with members of his family until his father's death in February, 1983. He was extremely close to his father who apparently offered a degree of discipline which his mother was subsequently unable to do. Following the death of his father, J.E.L.'s behaviour deteriorated; school suspensions and incidents of running away from home occurred. Since August of 1984, J.E.L. has been in the care of Alberta Social Services in various group homes and a boarding apartment situation. The testimony of the psychiatrists concerning J.E.L. is conflicting. According to the defence psychiatrist, there is a strong possibility that J.E.L. can re-establish close relationships which might result in abandonment of his anti-social ways. The Crown psychiatrist took the bleaker view that J.E.L. suffered from an untreatable personality disorder. Tests conducted on J.E.L. reveal he is of above average intelligence; his troubles at school and his inability to remain employed would seem to stem more from a lack of motivation than a lack of ability.",

Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 2 of theIdentification of Criminals Actread: 2.(1) Any person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable offence, or who has been apprehended under theExtradition Actor theFugitive Offenders Act,may be subjected, by or under the direction of those in whose custody he is, to the measurements, processes and operations practised under the system for the identification of criminals commonly known as the Bertillon Signaletic System, or to any measurements, processes or operations sanctioned by the Governor in Council having the like object in view. (2) Such force may be used as is necessary to the effectual carrying out and application of such measurements, processes and operations. Chief Justice McEachern of the Supreme Court of British Columbia held that a juvenile charged with a delinquency under theJuvenile Delinquents Actis not a person charged with an indictable offence within the meaning of s. 2 of theIdentification of Criminals Act.To reach that conclusion, Chief Justice McEachern relied on both the judgment of the Supreme Court and that of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia inR. v. A.N.,respectively reported at [1977] 5 W.W.R. 549 and (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 329. He also relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island inR. v. D.G.(1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 157. Chief Justice McEachern further held that the common law does not authorize the use of force to take fingerprints. He therefore answered the question in the negative. [Page 196] Reversing, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia concluded \"...that a juvenile charged with a delinquency which is also an offence punishable by indictment is a person charged with an indictable offence within the meaning and for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act\". The Court of Appeal consequently answered the question in the affirmative on that basis. As a result it became unnecessary to deal with the common law point and the Court did not \"comment on any common law right to fingerprint without the consent of the juvenile suspect\".

    "text": "On the statutory point, the Court of Appeal had this to say: We are supported in our conclusion by consideration of the intent of the Parliament of Canada. In enacting theIdentification of Criminals Act,the criterion established by Parliament for determining the applicability of this statutory power was not the age of the accused but the seriousness of the crime allegedly committed—indictable offences and offences under certain specified statutes. That Parliament was concerned primarily with the nature of the crime rather than the age of the accused is consistent with the limitation of s. 44(1) of theYoung Offenders Act,Bill C-61, 1980-81, that no fingerprints of a young person who is accused of committing an offence shall be taken except in circumstances in which an adult may, under theIdentification of Criminals Act,be fingerprinted. In other words age, as a test of applicability, defers to the magnitude of the crime. The Court of Appeal also relied on the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario inR. v. Clark(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 319 and on the majority judgment of this Court inMorris v. The Queen,[1979] 1 S.C.R. 405. This latter judgment on which both respondents relied heavily in their argument on the statutory point is, in my view, determinative of the issue in this case. The facts inMorrisare summarized in the headnote as follows: Appellant, aged 19, was found guilty by the Court of Queen's Bench, Criminal Side, for the district of Montreal, consisting of a judge and jury, on a charge of breaking and entering with intent (s. 306Cr.C.). He appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the trial judge erred by allowing evidence of the cross- [Page 197] examination of appellant, in which he contradicted the evidence he had given in chief and admitted having been found guilty, under theJuvenile Delinquents Act,of offences, under theCriminal Code.The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction; hence the appeal to this Court.

The majority in that case confirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal with respect to both s. 12 of theCanada Evidence Actand s. 593 of theCriminal Code. The majority reasons with respect to s. 593Cr.C.are of no assistance here. We are not concerned with the adducing of evidence of previous convictions or of other evidence in answer to evidence of his good character adduced by the accused, nor with the question whether the evidence adduced by the accused constituted evidence of his good character, on which the s. 593 issue turned inMorris.For the purposes of this appeal, it will therefore be sufficient to consider the judgment of this Court inMorrisonly as it relates to s. 12 of theCanada Evidence Act,R.S.C. 1970, c. Subsection (1) of this section reads: 12.(1) A witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence, and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction. InMorris,two grounds were relied upon in support of the proposition that s. 12 did not authorize the questioning of an accused as to his previous delinquencies, namely (i) a delinquency is not an offence within the meaning of this expression as used in s. 12; and (ii) a finding of delin- [Page 198] quency is not to be construed as a conviction for the purposes of s. 12.

Leaving aside the delinquencies of the second category that I have mentioned above, theJuvenile Delinquents Actdoes not prescribe any special rule of human conduct for juveniles; theCriminal Codeand the other statutes referred to above are applicable to juveniles and non-juveniles alike. Essentially, theJuvenile Delinquents Actdoes not create any offence; the offence results from the violation of another statute which, in the case at bar, is theCriminal Code.But, when the offence is committed by a juvenile, a particular method of enforcement is prescribed: the usual type of penalty imposed in criminal matters,i.e.imprisonment or fine, intended to act as a deterrent of wrongful action, is generally replaced by various courses of action left at the discretion of the Court and designed to provide the child with such care, education and protection as he requires in order to rehabilitate himself and mature into a law-abiding citizen.

    "text": "The Act \"provides a special procedure for the discipline and treatment of children outside of the ordinary criminal courts, although their delinquencies may be offences under theCriminal Code\" . InAttorney General of British Columbia v. Smith, supra,Fauteux J., as he then was, speaking for the Court, rightly pointed out at p. 708 that: \"The primary legal effect of theJuvenile Delinquents Act,..., is the effective substitution, in the case of juveniles, of the provisions of the Act to the enforcement provisions of theCriminal Codeor\" of any other relevant statute. [Page 199] InMorris,the delinquencies adjudged against the accused all consisted in violations of theCriminal Code,some of which at least were indictable offences. Stating the question to be answered, Pratte J. wrote, at p. 428: The question that stands up for determination is therefore quite narrow: it is whether the word \"offence\" as used in s. 12(1) of theCanada Evidence Actincludes a delinquency consisting in a violation of theCriminal Codewhich is enforceable under theJuvenile Delinquents Actrather than theCodeitself. And, on the same page, he concluded: In brief, the expression \"any offence\" in s. 12(1) clearly includes an offence that is a violation of theCriminal Codewhen it is punishable under theCode; in the absence of any expressed legislative intent to the contrary, I cannot logically bring myself to the view that the same expression excludes the same violation when it is punishable under theJuvenile Delinquents Actwhich, like theCode,is \"genuine legislation in relation to criminal law\". The question as to whether the word \"offence\" included delinquencies other than violations of theCriminal Codewas left open. Pratte J. wrote at p. 428: I express no opinion as to whether the meaning of the word \"offence\" as used in s. 12(1) of theCanada Evidence Actshould otherwise be restricted so as to exclude certain kinds of delinquencies. But the Court clearly decided that \"offence\" included delinquencies consisting in violations of theCriminal Code. As was held inMorrisand is equally applicable here \"...theJuvenile Delinquents Actdoes not create any offence; the offence results from the violation of another statute which, in the case at bar, is theCriminal Code\". The mere fact that because the appellant is a juvenile the special procedure provided for by theJuvenile Delinquents Actis substituted to the enforcement provisions of theCriminal Code,does not alter the nature of the offence.",

There remains the question whether a juvenile charged with a delinquency consisting in an indictable offence can be said to be a person \"charged\" with an indictable offence within the meaning of s. 2(1) of theIdentification of Criminals Act.The disposition by this Court of the second ground inMorrisis, in my view, decisive.

At trial, they led evidence that in early 1979 three of the appellants were employed, with sixteen crew members, to deliver, by ship (theSamarkanda) a load of cannabis (marihuana) worth $6,000,000 or $7,000,000 from a point in international waters off the coast of Colombia, South America, to a drop point in international waters 200 miles off the [Page 237] coast ofAlaska. The ship leftTumaco, Colombia, empty with a port clearance document stating the destination to beJuneau,Alaska. For three weeks the ship remained in international waters off the coast ofColombia. While there, a DC-6 aircraft made four trips, dropping into the water shrimp nets with a total of 634 bales of cannabis which were retrieved by the ship's longboats. A \"communications\" package was also dropped from a light aircraft, giving instructions for a rendez-vous with another vessel, theJulia \"B\",which was to pick up the cargo of cannabis from theSamarkandain international waters off the coast ofAlaska.En route,according to the defence evidence, the vessel began to encounter a series of problems; engine breakdowns, overheating generators and malfunctioning navigation devices, aggravated by deteriorating weather. In the meantime the fourth appellant, Nelson, part owner of the illicit cargo, and three other persons leftSeattlein a small boat, theWhitecap,intending to rendez‐vous with theSamarkandaat the drop point inAlaska. The problems of theSamarkandaintensified as fuel was consumed. The vessel became lighter, the intakes in the hull for sea water, used as a coolant, lost suction and took in air instead, causing the generators to overheat. At this point the vessel was 180 miles from the Canadian coastline. The weather worsened. There were eight-to-ten-foot swells and a rising wind. It was finally decided for the safety of ship and crew to seek refuge on the Canadian shoreline for the purpose of making temporary repairs. TheWhitecapfound a sheltered cove on the west coast of Vancouver Island, \"No Name Bay\". TheSamarkandafollowed theWhitecapinto the Bay but later grounded amidships on a rock because the depth sounder was not working. The tide ran out. The vessel listed severely to starboard, to the extent that the Captain, fearing the vessel was going to capsize, ordered the men to offload the [Page 238] cargo.

That is a brief summary of the defence evidence. Early on the morning ofMay 22, 1979police officers entered No Name Bay in a marked police boat with siren sounding. TheSamarkandaand theWhitecapwere arrested, as were all the appellants except Perka and Nelson, the same morning. The vessels and 33.49 tons of cannabis marihuana were seized by the police officers. Charged with importing cannabis intoCanadaand with possession for the purpose of trafficking, the appellants claimed they did not plan to import intoCanadaor to leave their cargo of cannabis inCanada. They had planned to make repairs and leave. Expert witnesses on marine matters called by the defence testified that the decision to come ashore was, in the opinion of one witness, expedient and prudent and in the opinion of another, essential. At trial, counsel for the Crown alleged that the evidence of the ship's distress was a recent fabrication. Crown counsel relied on the circumstances under which the appellants were arrested to belie the \"necessity\" defence; when the police arrived on the scene most of the marihuana was already onshore, along with plastic ground sheets, battery operated lights, liquor, food, clothing, camp stoves, and sleeping bags. Nevertheless, the jury believed the appellants and acquitted them. The acquittal was reversed on appeal. After the close of the case for the accused at trial, the Crown had applied to call rebuttal evidence with respect to the condition of the vessel. The trial judge refused the Crown's application. He held that the defence evidence relating to the happenings in the engine room should not have caught the prosecution by surprise and in the circumstances, the conditions for calling rebuttal evidence had not been met. At trial the defence also relied upon a \"botanical defence\" arguing that the Crown had failed to prove that the ship's cargo was \"cannabis sativaL.\", as provided for in the Schedule to theNarcotic Control Act,R.S.C. 1970, c. Thus [Page 239] the appellants had committed no offence. The trial judge withdrew the botanical defence from the jury.",

    "text": "Thus [Page 239] the appellants had committed no offence. The trial judge withdrew the botanical defence from the jury. On appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, held that the trial judge had erred in refusing to grant leave to the Crown to call rebuttal evidence and, on the cross-appeal held that the judge was correct in withdrawing the botanical defence from the jury. The appellants have now appealed to this Court. In addition to claiming that the Court of Appeal erred in reversing the trial judge on the rebuttal issue, the appellants contend that the Court of Appeal applied the wrong standard in ordering a new trial. The appellants also contend that the botanical defence should have been left with the jury. The Crown, of course, takes the opposite position on each of these questions and has raised one of its own: whether the trial judge erred in charging the jury with respect to the necessity defence. Because the appellants raised a preliminary objection to this Court even addressing this last issue, I will deal with it first. The appellants argue that this Court should not consider the Crown's contentions with respect to the necessity defence because the Court of Appeal decided that the defence was available and the jury could properly be instructed on it. Accordingly, the appellants contend the Crown's argument with respect to the defence of necessity is really in the nature of a cross‐appeal. Since the Crown does not have an appeal as of right to this Court and since leave has not been granted, the appellants say this Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the issues raised by the \"cross-appeal\". [Page 240] In both civil and criminal matters it is open to a respondent to advance any argument to sustain the judgment below, and he is not limited to appellants' points of law. A party cannot, however, raise an entirely new argument which has not been raised below and in relation to which it might have been necessary to adduce evidence at trial. SeeBrown v. Dean,[1910] A.C. 373;Dormuth v. Untereiner,[1964] S.C.R. 122;The SS. \"Tordenskjold\" v. The SS. \"Euphemia\"(1908), 41 S.C.R. 154;Dairy Foods, Inc. v.

She was shot by Rolan Farrant, aged seventeen. Shannon and her friend Shelly Thomas had spent the day together. Early in the evening they went to a friend's house for a party. Farrant arrived later. He and Shannon were childhood friends. They had been \"going steady\" for four years. Between 8:15 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. Farrant drank four bottles of beer and had four or five drags, or \"tokes\" as he called them, from a pipe of marihuana. Farrant and Shannon talked alone. There was evience of an argument. In his statement to the police Farrant said \"She didn't like the way I treated her, I didn't like the way she was treating me. We just haven't been getting along lately\". Then Shannon and her friend left. They went to Shannon's house. Other friends arrived. Farrant phoned Shannon. He wanted to come over and talk to her. She told him she did not want to talk with him as her friends were there. He told her that he was coming anyway, and that he was bringing a rifle. Upon arrival, he approached the house from the rear, leaving the rifle in his vehicle. He met two of his friends on the back porch and asked them to leave so he could talk to Shannon [Page 131] alone. He went inside and ordered everyone to \"go have a coffee for half an hour\". No one left. He went out the back door, loaded the rifle, and returned to the house with it. Then, as the trial judge expressed it, \"with the persuasiveness of the rifle\" they all left. The witnesses at trial said that Farrant \"motioned with his gun\" for everyone to leave. One of Shannon's friends, Mary Kennedy, grabbed Shannon by the arm and \"told her that she should come with us\". Mary said that Farrant \"told me to let go of her arm and just leave the house\". Shannon was \"crying and shaking and sitting on one of the couches\".

On February 12, 1979, an off-duty taxi driver, one Roger Chassé, left his residence in Campbellton, New Brunswick, to go to Cross Point, in the Province of Quebec, to make a few purchases. He then proceeded home and was taken in chase in Quebec by appellant, a Quebec police officer. The reasons for this chase are related by the trial judge as follows: [TRANSLATION] The testimony established that the accused is a member of the Quebec Police Force, stationed at Matapédia, Province of Quebec. In the course of his duties he stopped an automobile driven by one Lucius Landry at the entrance to the bridge leading from Cross Point to Campbellton, on the Quebec side. While he was questioning the driver of the vehicle he had stopped, he saw a taxi coming toward him at high speed. The driver who had been stopped, Lucius Landry, noticed nothing unusual: he thought everything was just as usual. As the vehicle, which we now know was a taxi driven by Roger Chassé, was approaching the bridge, the accused said that it was being driven on the left side [Page 315] of the road, the police car and Landry's car being parked on the right side of the road at the entrance to the bridge. When the accused looked in the direction in which the taxi was travelling, he saw a van coming and said he expected there would be a collision, but that the van pulled to the right to allow the taxi to pass. He then returned to his car and set off in pursuit, travelling at speeds up to 70 mph on the interprovincial bridge. The speed of the taxi was not determined. On arriving at the intersection of Subway and Roseberry Streets in Campbellton, N.B., the accused, who was driving an unmarked car without a red light, said he drove up beside the taxi using his siren and trying to stop it. The driver of the taxi made certain gestures toward him with his finger and continued going, turning onto Minto Street and slowing to a stop at Minto and Arran.",

He then turned onto Tingley Crescent, which is a residential area, and when he turned this corner the accused took out his 38 revolver and fired two warning shots into the air. The chase continued around Tingley Crescent and the taxi stopped at a point which was later found to be the taxi driver's residence. The accused jumped out of his car and ran toward the taxi with his gun in his hand. The taxi began moving and the accused then fired three shots at the taxi, puncturing a tire and making two holes in the mudguard.

[Page 493] As the two passengers left the complainant's vehicle, the accused returned to his vehicle, made a U-turn, then drove into the complainant's vehicle and pushed it thirty to forty feet down the lane. The accused then drove away without leaving his name and address with anyone who had witnessed the accident. The sole issue raised and considered throughout the appeals in the courts below and to be determined in this Court is a narrow one and is the following: Does the presumption created by section 233(3) of the Criminal Code apply on proof of any one of the events: (1) failure to stop; (2) failure to give name and address; (3) failure to offer assistance (where any person has been injured); or does that presumption apply only on proof of all of those events (or on the first two of them where there is no personal injury)? Section 233(3) should be read with s. 233(2) 233.... (2) Every one who, having the care, charge or control of a vehicle that is involved in an accident with a person, vehicle or cattle in the charge of a person, with intent to escape civil or criminal liability fails to stop his vehicle, give his name and address and, where any person has been injured, offer assitance, is guilty of (a)an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years, or (b)an offence punishable on summary conviction. (3) In proceedings under subsection (2), evidence that an accused failed to stop his vehicle, offer assistance where any person has been injured and give his name and address is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof of an intent to escape civil and criminal liability. Of importance is the fact that most if not all courts in the land have held (and I agree rightly so) the enumeration of s. 233(2) to be disjunctive (R. v.",

In answering this question regarding the application of subs. 3, the courts throughout Canada are divided, as was the Court of Appeal in this case. McFarlane and Carrothers JJ.A. would require proof of all the events. Craig J.A., dissenting, was of the view that the presumption would arise upon proof of any one of the events. The views of the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal are shared by the Court of Appeal of Ontario (seeR. v. Wills(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 520), whilst those of Craig J.A. are shared by the Courts of Appeal of Alberta (seeR. v. Parks, supra) and of Saskatchewan (seeR. v. Adler, supra). InWills, supra,Arnup J.A., writing for the Court, did not give any reasons for the position he took and merely stated, at p. 521: In our view the presumption of s-s.(3) of s. 233 does not apply in the circumstances of this case, in that the appellant did not both fail to stop his vehicle and failed to give his name and address. Accordingly, theprima facieproof of intent to escape civil or criminal liability was not brought into play through that subsection. As for theParksandAdlerdecisions, they were both predicated uponR. v. Steere, supra,a decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. In that case, the issue was whether a case is made out under s. 233(2) if it be proved that the accused failed to perform any one of the three duties imposed, namely: (1) to stop his vehicle; (2) to give his name and address; and (3) where any person has been injured, to offer assistance. McFarlane J.A., writing for the Court, had found in the affirmative.",

    "text": "McFarlane J.A., writing for the Court, had found in the affirmative. The Alberta and Saskatchewan Courts of Appeal, apart from alluding to theSteeredecision, gave little or no reasons, (as did the Ontario Court of Appeal to find conversely) in support of their findings. [Page 495] Such is not the case here. Both McFarlane J.A. for the Court and Craig J.A. gave thorough reasons, and I must admit, both very convincing reasons supporting their views. The essence of McFarlane J.A.'s reasons is found in the following passage of his judgment: It may seem,prima facie,inconsistent and illogical to apply the word \"and\" disjunctively in subsection (2) but conjunctively in subsection (3). Thisprima facieinconsistency disappears, however, in my opinion, on a comparison of the syntax of the two subsections. I think the correct meaning of subsection (2) is that Parliament intended an accused should be guilty of an offence unless all of the described statutory duties be performed, provided, of course, intent to escape liability be proved. On the other hand, I find no absurd, unintelligible or meaningless result when the word \"and\" in subsection (3) is read conjunctively asprima facieit should be in accord with its usual normal meaning. It would appear from this passage that McFarlane J.A. was of the view that, since a literal reading of s. 233(3) does not lead to an \"absurd, unintelligible or meaningless result\", the enumeration contained therein should be construed as being conjunctive and the word \"and\" given its primary meaning. This, in my view, is the proper approach when a section is not open to more than one interpretation. Indeed, when such is the case, the courts need not interpret the section and should not seek out the object of the section in order to ascertain whether it has been frustrated by the draftsmen and then give the words of the section an unusual meaning. But when the section is capable of more than one interpretation, then the approach taken by Craig J.A. is, in my view, the correct one. It might be said that s. 233(3) read in isolation is clear. But this is not the type of section that should be treated in that way, as it is ancillary to s. 233(2).",

It is when one reads s. 233(2) that one sees that the enumeration in s. 233(3) may be conjunctive or disjunctive and therefore open to interpreta- [Page 496] tion. I fail to see why the courts may find s. 233(3) any less open to interpretation as to whether it was disjunctive or conjunctive than s. 233(2), a fact as regards the latter all courts, including the British Columbia and Ontario Courts of Appeal, have acknowledged (seeR. v. Kipling, supra, R. v. Steere, supra). There is no peremptory argument, as the courts seem to have found inParksandAdler,to be drawn from the fact that the enumeration in s. 233(2) is disjunctive. Section 233(2) can be disjunctive whilst its supportive s. 233(3) still be conjunctive, one creating the offence, the other determining when a presumption will be triggered. Indeed, it is not because the purpose sought by s. 233(2) is best served by a disjunctive reading of that section that the purpose will of necessity be best furthered through a disjunctive reading of s. 233(3). But, if given a choice of interpretation, and if such is the case, the disjunctive reading is the one the Court should choose. Let us then look to the purpose sought to be served by both sections. With respect, I am of the view that the interpretation that will best serve the object of the Act is the disjunctive one. On this point, I cannot express my views any better than by quoting Craig J.A. in his reasons where he said: Should subsection (3) be interpreted conjunctively, or disjunctively? The answer to this question depends on the intention of the Legislature. While the question is a vexing one, I tend to the view that s-s. (3) should be interpreted to mean that presumption arises if the accused fails to do any one of the three things mentioned. Obviously, the purpose of the presumption is to facilitate proof of the gravamen of the offence, namely, the intent to escape civil or criminal liability.",

Without a presumption provision, the Crown would in most cases have to rely solely on the failure to do one of the three things mentioned to prove the intent. A judge might, or might not, infer that the intent had been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if an accused failed to do all of these three things, the inference of intent would, probably, be irresistible. In those circumstances, the Crown would not have to rely on any [Page 497] presumption of intent. The need to rely on a presumption would appear to be necessary only in a case where the inference of intent is not irresistible. I think, therefore, that if Parliament intended that the accused could commit the offence by failing to do any one of the three things specified in s-s. (2), Parliament intended, also, that the presumption provision would be applicable in any case where the accused failed to do any of the things specified. The presumption provision does not place any onus on the accused to establish his lack of intent. The onus remains on the Crown to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption provision simply assists the Crown in achieving that standard of proof and is applicable only in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.

    "text": "(Emphasis added.) With respect, this is clearly, in my view, misdirection in law. The fate of the accused's defence of colour of right was not dependent upon the jury determining when the commissions were payable. That question was indeed important as relevant to whether the monies were his or those of his clients. The fact that they still be the property of the client was a prerequisite to his having to raise a defence to the taking or conversion. Rather, the accused's [Page 799] defence was dependent upon whether they, the jury, were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he, the accused, had not, at the time of the transfers, an honest belief that he had the right to that money, and not, as they were told, dependent upon what they, the jurors, thought his rights were. Respondent Crown, whilst supporting the judge's charge on colour of right, argues that, if this Court were of a different view, the conviction should still stand, as this defence did not arise for $13,500 of the $26,759.58, as the appellant had admitted that for the three transactions comprising that amount he relied only on his lack of knowledge of the transfers from the \"in trust\" account to the general account. This argument is at first sight appealing and in fact was the basis for the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's decision, but cannot resist closer consideration. Indeed this reasoning seems to me to be overlooking three facts. First, the Crown chose not to identify the transactions into separate counts. That is the right of the Crown and was understandable given the fact the transfers were for sums that did not correspond to identified deposits. However, after cross-examining the accused, it had become apparent through his answers that there were, as of then, two groups of transactions to be considered, one raising and the other not the defence of colour of right. It would have been preferable to sever the count at that stage.",

    "text": "It would have been preferable to sever the count at that stage. Indeed, had the trial been before a judge sitting without a jury, the matter would have been dealt with by him in the reasons for judgment, or again the verdict might well have been one of guilt for the lesser amount of $13,500, the implication being clearly that the defence of colour of right had succeeded when applicable and that of \"lack of knowledge\" failed when standing alone. But we are here dealing with a jury, which is the second fact I refer to. [Page 800] Juries do not give reasons. Furthermore, they were not told they could find the accused guilty for a lesser amount if satisfied that for some of the transactions the defence of colour of right had been successful. Rather, and this brings us to the third fact I wish to allude to, they were told by the trial judge, in the course of his charge to them, that \"you are not required to find the exact amount stolen but you are required to find that in this case the amount stolen exceeds $200.00 under each charge\" (by \"each charge\" he was referring to each of the two counts in the indictment). This, I hasten to say, is not misdirection. However, when there is, as in this case, a defence of colour of right applicable only to some of the transactions, this direction in conjunction to a misdirection as to that defence has the following effect: not knowing whether the jury's verdict of guilty was for one, or more, or all of the transactions, the verdict could well be resting on one of those transactions where the defence of colour of right was available and concerning which I have found clear misdirection. I would therefore allow this appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial. At first, I had thought of severing the count before returning the file to the Court below. After some reflection upon the matter, I think it preferable to leave the matter to the trial judge in the light of what the Crown might choose to do or the defence request be done to the charge.

R.S.C. 1970. The trial on the three counts was held, with a jury, before Mr. Justice Bergeron of the Quebec Superior Court. At the end of the Crown's case defence counsel, while reserving his right to call evidence, made a number of motions among which was a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on the importing charge. For the purpose of dealing with the defence motions, the trial judge gave the following summary of the Crown's evidence: On April 11 or 12, just a disparity of an hour or two there, a shipment of four foot stools gift wrapped with birthday paper originating from Jamaica and addressed [Page 474] to the accused's name bearing a St-Hubert P.Q. address first arrived in Toronto. A brief examination by customs disclosed that the foot stools contained cannabis. The R.C.M.P. of a St-Jérôme detatchment [sic],Québec near the point of arrival for international flight of Mirabel, duly advised of the fact, obtained the goods from customs, gave receipt and took them to their St-Jérôme headquarters. An examination revealed the presence of six point seven pounds of marijuana in the four stools. Most of the substance was removed from them, a small quantity being left in them before repacking the stools as well as could be done and then taking them back on/or about April 18 to the customs warehouse where instructions to advise ...with instructions to advise the R.C.M.P. as to anyone calling for their release.

Two more people also arrived, a man in a Cadillac and a young girl, all these people black. The police rounded up the whole group and immediately proceeded into the house using a writ of assistance and found the four stools unwrapped and piled on a single bed in the back room. Their wrapping paper was found partly on the kitchen table, partly in the waste basket or garbage container and partly on the floor. On the table was also present what appeared to be the structure of a dismantled foot stool, it's covering material removed. Another similar structure was found outside the house, in the back of it, off a small gallery and near a garbage bag or can. A scraping of the stool structure between the post and the walls showed the presence of zero point six grams of marijuana. Much more was filed as evidence regarded the procedure used in exporting from Jamaica, waybills, releases et cetera, and procedure at counters and so on.

The accused argued before Bergeron J. that, since the goods came into Canada at Toronto, the importation was terminated in Toronto, so that there was no evidence to go to the jury of importing at Mirabel as charged. The trial judge did not accept the argument, holding that importing may extend beyond the time and place of entry into Canada. Bergeron J. nonetheless granted the motion for a directed verdict on the basis that the police possession of the marijuana interrupted the necessary continuity of possession of the accused.

On the one hand, MacKay J.A., in whose opinion Porter C.J.A. concurred, said first at p. 285: I am of the opinion thatin the circumstances of this case,the convictions for both theft and possession cannot stand... and after citing the foregoing observations of Kellock J., said the following, at p. 286, concerning the decision rendered by the British Columbia Court of Appeal inR. v. Van Dorn: Counsel for the Crown referred us toR. v. Van Dorn(1956), 116 C.C.C. 325, in which it was held that convictions for both offences, i.e. theft and possession, could stand where the possession charged is not [Page 774] so intimately identified in time and place as to form part of the theft itself.It may be that in certain circumstances this might be so.But in a casesuch as the presentwhere the appellant was the actual thief and had had continuous possession of the motor vehicle from the time it was stolen by him, I think the two offences arise from the one act. The same act that constituted the theft constituted the offence of having unlawful possession.To apply the principles of the Quon case it is of course necessary to treat the unlawful possession, whether, it be for a matter of minutes or months, as one continuing offence. In my opinion this is so. Morden J.A., on the other hand, in contrast with his two colleagues, made no mention ofQuon, supra,rejected the principle inVan Dorn, supra,and, basing himself on decisions rendered by this Court prior to substitution of s. 296—unlawful possession—for s. 399—receiving and retaining stolen goods—, concluded as follows, at p. 289: Having regard to the views expressed by the majority of the Judges in the Clay case as to the effect to be given to former s. 399, I cannot accept the argument that parliament in enacting the present s. 296 to replace the former s. 399, intended that a person could be convicted of the offence of theft as well as guilty possession of the thing stolen.",

So, and I say it in all deference, I cannot really see why in such circumstances there can be question of pleas ofautrefois acquitorautrefois convict,ofres judicataor of maxims used to limit multiplication of convictions, when the acts complained of, constituting but one offence, cannot result in more than one conviction. For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal on the merits and order that the case be remitted to the Court of Appeal for it to impose the sentences after giving appellant an opportunity, [Page 775] personally or through counsel, to make representations on the subject. MARTLAND J.—Had it not been for the judgment of the full Court in the case ofJohn Edward Kienapple v. Her Majesty The Queen,to be rendered concurrently with the judgment in the present appeal, I would have agreed with Chief Justice Fauteux in holding that the appellant's appeal against his convictions should be dismissed.

    "text": "The three other counts on which conviction was pronounced are similar in every respect, except that they concern sums of money, totalling $7,200, received from Serge Roy Productions Ltée and from Armand Serge Roy, between 1959 and 1962. It should be noted at the outset that, in finding appellant guilty, Rivard J.A. who wrote the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal, relied essentially on the deposition of the accused, which was accepted as sincere by the trial judge. There is thus no disagreement as to the facts, which is as it should be since an appeal against an acquittal may only be made on a point of law. The first ground put forward before us was that under the statute governing the CBC, appellant was not an \"official\". The enactment in force at the time was subs. (1) of s. 26 of theBroadcasting Act(1958 (Can.), c. 22, now replaced by R.S.C., c. B-11, s. 38(2)). It reads as follows: [Page 777] 26.(1) The Corporation may on its own behalf employ such officers and employees as it considers necessary for the conduct of its business, at such remuneration and upon such other terms as it deems fit, but the officers and employees so employed are not officers or servants of Her Majesty. Though it is true that, in the French version of ss. 102 and 103 of theCriminal Code,the word used is \"fonctionnaire\", as in the indictment, it must be noted that the word \"official\" is used in the English version, while in the English version of theBroadcasting Actthe expression used is \"officers and employees\". Furthermore, this expression is not defined therein, and must accordingly be taken in its ordinary meaning. In theCriminal Code,on the other hand, the word \"official\" (fonctionnaire) is given, for the purposes of the Part with which we are concerned, a special definition which is complemented by those of \"office\" and \"public department\".",

    "text": "In theCriminal Code,on the other hand, the word \"official\" (fonctionnaire) is given, for the purposes of the Part with which we are concerned, a special definition which is complemented by those of \"office\" and \"public department\". These provisions are para. (e) and (d) of s. 99 (now s. 107), and subs. (34) of s. 2: (e) \"official\" means a person who (i) holds an office, or (ii) is appointed to discharge a public duty; (d) \"office\" includes (i) an office or appointment under the government; (ii) a civil or military commission, and (iii) a position or employment in a public department; (34) \"public department\" means a department of the Government of Canada or a branch thereof or a board, commission, corporation or other body that is an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada. From these definitions it is clear that the CBC is a public department under theCriminal Code,though it is not under various administrative statutes. Indeed, subs. (1) of s. 27 of theBroad- [Page 778] casting Act(now replaced by R.S.C., c. B-11, s. 40(1)) provides: 27.(1) Except as provided in subsection (1) of section 26, the Corporation is, for all purposes of this Act, an agent of Her Majesty, and its powers under this Act may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty. The exception found at the beginning of this provision certainly does not extend the scope of the section to which it refers. The latter does not contain any special definition, and so must be taken in the ordinary meaning of the words used. As to this ordinary meaning, the following observation was made in the reasons issued inJones and Maheux v. Gamache[11], at p. 132: [TRANSLATION]... it must be pointed out that the word \"fonctionnaire\" does not necessarily mean \"civil servant\", although this is indeed the meaning ordinarily given to it at the present time.",

This remark was made in connection with the meaning of the word \"fonctionnaire\" in para. (c) of s. 29 of theExchequer Court Act.It may well be that the effect of the wording of theBroadcasting Actis to exclude the employees of the CBC from the scope of this provision, as well as from subs. (1) of s. 3 of theCrown Liability Act.It is reasonable to suppose that, corporate status being conferred upon their employer, the intention was that the latter should be answerable for them, not the government. It is quite a different thing to assume that Parliament wished to grant them immunity from the Part of theCriminal Codeentitled \"Offences against the Administration of Law and Justice\". This assumption is even less justified as the word \"official\" is there given a meaning which goes considerably beyond the ordinary meaning. It need only be noted that inThe Queen v. Sheets[12]this Court held that a member of a municipal council is an official within the meaning of this provision, though an elected representative, not an employee of the [Page 779] municipality. Identical decisions were given inMartineau v. The Queen[13]in respect of a member of a Legislative Council, and inSommers v. The Queen[14]regarding a Minister of the Crown. I conclude, therefore, that the wording of theBroadcasting Actdid not prevent the appellant from being an official within the meaning of theCriminal Code,because at the time in question he had employment in a \"public department\". Secondly, it was argued that as the trial judge accepted the version of the facts given by the accused, it must be admitted that the sums received by the accused were paid, not in consideration of exercise of influence in connection with the transaction of business with the government, but in payment for work done.",

In the case at bar, I do not feel it is necessary to consider in what circumstances an official may accept payment for work done for someone other than the public department which employs him. Under para. (c) of subs. (1) of s. 102Crim. Code(second and eighth counts of the indictment), it is sufficient for an offence to be committed that the official accepts a benefit from anyone having business dealings with the government, \"unless he has the consent in writing of the head of the branch of government that employs him or of which he is an official, the proof of which lies upon him\". Only the offence under para. (a) (first and seventh counts of the indictment) requires that the benefit be received \"as consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or...\" [Page 780] As concerns the second and eighth counts of the indictment, therefore, even admitting that the accused received from the persons named in the indictment only the true value of services rendered outside his working hours, he committed the offence because he received the benefit without the written consent of the head of the branch of government which employed him. Clearly, the fact that a sum of money or other value represents only the equivalent of the benefits conferred does not prevent it from being \"a commission, reward, advantage or benefit\". The words \"commission\" and \"reward\" suggest the idea of compensation for services rendered. A salary received for manual or intellectual labour is undoubtedly a benefit within the meaning of theIncome Tax Act,and there is no reason why it should be otherwise under theCriminal Code.Only a loan, which requires the return of the sum received, may be regarded differently, and it is worth noting that it is not mentioned in para. (c), where the word \"commission\" is used instead of the word \"loan\" in para. (a). This difference is significant.",

    "text": "This difference is significant. Under para. (a) it is proper to consider whether the sum paid exceeds the equivalent of the value given, because this may be important in deciding whether it is in consideration of an exercise of influence. This point does not arise under para. (c), because only an authorization from the head of the branch of government prevents the official from being regarded as putting himself in a conflict of interest situation by accepting compensation of any kind from a person dealing with the government. In the case at bar it is unnecessary to consider whether the evidence has to show guilty intent on the part of the official who is in breach of para. (c). Here the clandestine nature of the transaction is clear proof of such guilty intent. It would be a gross misinterpretation of the standards of honesty required in public life to accept [Page 781] as an explanation the accused's contention that such clandestinity was prompted by the desire to defraud the tax collector. Having found that the accused was properly convicted on the two counts based on para. (c) of subs. (1) of s. 102, it does not appear to me necessary to consider whether the facts supported his conviction on the other counts. The offences in question are all equally serious, they carry exactly the same penalty. There is thus no need to consider whether the most serious offence has been established. In my view this is a case for application of the principle stated in s. 11 of theCriminal Code,in the following terms: 11.Where an act or omission is an offence under more than one Act of the Parliament of Canada, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does the act or makes the omission is, unless a contrary intention appears, subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be punished more than once for the same offence. The three counts dealing with the sums received from Artek Film Productions, Paul Legault and André Legault are, like the three other counts, based on the same act viewed in different ways. This act consisted of having, while an official, accepted this reward from these persons.",

In the first count of the indictment the act is characterized as a crime because the consideration for it was an alleged exercise of influence in connection with the transaction of business with the Government. In the second count the same act is characterized as a crime because it was done without the consent in writing of the head of the branch, and involved persons having dealings with the Government. Finally, in the third count this act is characterized as a crime on the same basis as in the first, but with the further allegation that it constituted a breach of trust. InThe King v. Quon[15], which upheld a deci- [Page 782] sion quashing a conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm, on the ground that such conviction had been pronounced concurrently with a conviction for armed robbery involving possession of the same weapon at the same time, Kellock J. said (at pp. 519-520): In approaching the question as to the proper view to be taken of the meaning of the statute, I think there are well settled principles to be kept in mind. The first is illustrated byWemyss v. Hopkins(1875) L.R. 10 Q.B. 378. In that case a complaint was preferred against the appellant under 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 50 (1), s. 78, for that being the driver of a carriage on a highway, by negligence or wilful misbehaviour, viz., by striking a certain horse ridden by the respondent, caused her hurt and damage. The appellant was convicted on this charge and fined. Subsequently a complaint was preferred against him under 24 and 25 Vict., c. 100, s. 42, for that he did on the same date as that in question on the first complaint and by reason of the same conduct, unlawfully assault, strike, and otherwise abuse the respondent. On this charge he was also convicted and fined. The question for the court was whether, the appellant having been convicted on the first, could also be convicted on the second complaint. It was held he could not, Blackburn, J., at p. 381 said:",

It was held he could not, Blackburn, J., at p. 381 said: The defence does not arise on a plea of autrefois convict, but on the well established rule at common law, that when a person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a court of competent jurisdiction,transit in rem judicatam,that is, the conviction shall be a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be punished again for the same matter; otherwise there might be two different punishments for the same offence... It is necessary in the present case to have it proved... that on a former occasion the appellant was charged with the same assault, although not in the same words, yet in terms the same, and that he was then convicted and punished. The above principle is embodied in section 14 of theCode.The common law principle is as applicable, in my opinion, in the case of two sections of the same statute as in the case of separate statutes. [Page 783] There is also to be borne in mind the second principle, as stated by Cockburn, C.J., inQueen v. Elrington(1861) 1 B.&.S. 688 at 696, viz.: \"the well established principle of our criminal law that a series of charges shall not be preferred and, whether a party accused of a minor offence is acquitted or convicted, he shall not be charged again on the same facts in a more aggravated form\". Section 907 embodies this latter principle. What was at that time s. 907 of theCriminal Codeis now s. 537, which deals with the defence ofautrefois acquitorautrefois convict.This provision applies to a case where, provided it can be made identical by amendment, \"the matter... is the same,in whole or in part\". Relying essentially on the aforementioned opinion of Kellock J., the Court of Appeal of Ontario held inRegina v. Siggins[16]that it should quash a conviction for unlawful possession of certain goods, pronounced concurrently with a conviction for theft of the same goods. MacKay, J.A., said (at p. 285):",

MacKay, J.A., said (at p. 285): The offence of theft where the person charged is the actual thief, necessarily involves the taking of possession by him of the article stolen, and the person found in possession of goods which he himself has stolen has also committed the offence of having in his possession goods knowing them to have been stolen. The Crown is entitled to lay both charges against him, but at the trial, if the jury convict of theft they should not convict on the charge of unlawful possession. If they acquit on the charge of theft they may then consider and, if they see fit to do so, convict on the charge of unlawful possession. After referring to the opinion of Kellock J., he also noted that subs. (2) (now subs. (3)) of s. 7 of theCriminal Coderecognizes defences at common law, even when they are not expressly enshrined in an enactment. [Page 784] InKienapple v. The Queen,a case on which all members of this Court sat, the majority judgment rendered today follows the principle of theSigginscase and Kellock's opinion above quoted. On that basis I fail to see how we could uphold more than one conviction against appellant for what is in substance the same matter namely the unlawful taking of sums of money from persons having dealings with the government of which he was an official. Accordingly, only the conviction on the second and eighth counts should be allowed to stand. Further, as the Court trying the case accepted the sincerity of the deposition given by the accused, the sum mentioned in the second count should be reduced to the amount admitted by him, that is to $12,000 (Lake v. The Queen)[17]. Finally, appellant complains that, the Court of Appeal having found him guilty, sentenced him without giving him an opportunity to make submissions on sentence.

    "text": "On February 26, 1985, Constable Gutteridge, a Joint Forces Officer with the Chatham police and the R.C.M.P., received confidential information from an informant that the appellant and two others, Greg Carpenter and Gerry List, were going to meet that evening for the purpose of completing a drug transaction involving around four ounces of speed. The transaction was to take place at Carpenter's residence and both he and the appellant were to receive a substantial amount of the drug. The speed was being brought into the Wallaceburg area by a supplier named by the informant. The informant told Gutteridge that he had obtained this information in conversation with Carpenter. Gutteridge had had at least one previous dealing with this informant and described him as \"reliable\". On that occasion the informant advised him that a large quantity of speed would be found at a particular residence. Only trace amounts of speed were found but a larger quantity of marijuana was seized. Gutteridge contacted Sergeant Briscoe, head of the R.C.M.P. detachment in Chatham, and passed on the information he had received from the informant to him. Gutteridge asked that the appellant, Carpenter and List all be put under surveillance. All these individuals were known by the Drug Section of the Chatham police to have had an involvement with drugs in the past. The police described the appellant as a user and trafficker although he had only one narcotics related conviction and that was for possession of a small amount of marijuana. Carpenter was also known as a user and trafficker. Warrants had been executed under theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1 , and theFood and Drugs Acton Carpenter's residence on previous occasions. He had a lengthy record of convictions for narcotics related offences. Sergeant Briscoe held a briefing session at which the information communicated to him by Gutteridge was relayed to the officers assigned to the surveillance, including Constables Birs and L'Heureux. Birs also testified that he was instructed earlier in the day directly by Gutteridge. Gutteridge's testimony is silent on this point. Several officers set up surveillance in the vicinity of Carpenter's residence. At one point Constable L'Heureux was instructed to follow a grey Ford compact which had just left Carpenter's residence. The car proceeded to a tavern where the occupants of the car, two men and a woman, parked and entered.",

The car proceeded to a tavern where the occupants of the car, two men and a woman, parked and entered. Constables L'Heureux and Birs observed from a distance what they thought might be a drug deal taking place between one of the men and another woman in the bar. Constable L'Heureux testified that he noticed an exchange of money and \"something else\" which he could not identify. At approximately 9:10 p.m. a dark-coloured Ford Bronco arrived at Carpenter's house. Gutteridge had seen the same car parked in front of the appellant's home several months earlier when he executed the search warrant issued under theFood and Drugs Actwhich ultimately led to the appellant's conviction for possession of marijuana. Gutteridge had also seen the appellant drive the car on several occasions. A number of people got out of the Bronco and at least one person went into the house. About five minutes later two men and two women came out of the house, got into the Bronco, and drove away. These observations were transmittedviapolice radio to Sergeant Briscoe who confirmed that the Bronco was registered in the appellant's name. Sergeant Briscoe instructed two police cars, one occupied by a Constable Martin and the other by Constables L'Heureux and Birs, to intercept and search the vehicle a few minutes after it left Carpenter's residence. The Bronco had entered the downtown area at the time it was stopped. Constable L'Heureux went to the driver's side of the car and had a conversation with the driver Sandra Murphy. She and another female passenger were subsequently searched at the police station after being advised of their right to counsel. Constable Birs went toward the passenger side and approached the appellant who had already stepped out of the Bronco. The Constable identified himself and asked the appellant his name, which the appellant gave. Constable Birs later testified that he did not know whether the appellant was in the car or not when he intercepted it. He asked the appellant if he was carrying drugs, to which the appellant replied that he was not. Constable Birs asked him again and received the same response.",

The appellant was ordered to face the wall of a nearby building in a \"spread eagle\" position and then told to empty his pockets. The appellant turned over a wad of money. Constable Birs discovered a sunglasses case in the appellant's pocket in which there was a clear plastic bag containing approximately one ounce of speed. The Constable then placed the appellant under arrest and advised him of hisCharterright to counsel. As Birs was putting the appellant into the car the appellant apparently volunteered the information that he had two syringes concealed in his sock and he produced those for the officer. A subsequent search of the Bronco uncovered no additional evidence. A search warrant executed on the Carpenter residence also yielded nothing.",

    "text": "The eight convictions of the appellant, a travel agent, for theft, were each in respect of money valued at more than $200, the property of eight named persons who were all clients of a travel agency. The appellant was the principal shareholder and president of that travel agency, R.B. & C. Agencies Limited. The following statement of the relevant facts by McGillivray C.J.A. is not in dispute. The company was incorporated in May of 1970 and functioned as a travel agency until about the middle of June, 1978. The other shareholders were the Appellant's wife and his daughter. The business was operated from rented premises by an office manager, a bookkeeper and Mrs. Lowden, who was an assistant to the bookkeeper. The Appellant did the banking on behalf of the company [Page 62] and had signing authority to issue cheques on the company's accounts. The company operated three bank accounts—a trust account, a general account and aU.S.account. The so-called trust account was reserved for the purpose of receiving and paying out money for airline tickets. The so-called general account was used for the purpose of paying out moneys for tours, rent-a-car arrangements and hotel reservations, and theU.S.account was reserved for the purpose of receiving and paying out moneys inU.S.funds. It is clear that the accounts, and in particular the trust account, were not designed for the specific purpose of separating moneys belonging to the company from moneys belonging to customers. As was mentioned, the company operated for a period of approximately eight years. It is to the accused's credit that while considerable volumes of business were done, increasing each year, at no time before June of 1978 did any of the agency's customers fail to get tickets or reservations which they had paid for. In 1975, sales amounted to nearly $300,000.00; this increased the next year to $597,000.00 and in 1977 to $841,000.00. The company books were at all times currently kept up and were meticulously accurate. Evidence relating to financial reports showed that in 1975 the company lost close to $12,000.00; in 1976 close to $22,000.00; and in 1977, something over $23,000.00. In 1976 the Appellant had an outstanding shareholder's loan to the company of $47,000.00 odd. By 1978, that. loan had increased to $77,000.00. Part of that shareholder's loan was secured by a second mortgage against the Appellant's house. ...",

Part of that shareholder's loan was secured by a second mortgage against the Appellant's house. ... In 1978 the Appellant arranged for overdraft privileges at his bank of up to $10,000.00, but these privileges were cancelled when the company began being overdrawn and not having the money the next day to cover the overdrafts. A bank account reconciliation by the company's bookkeeper showed that as of January 20, 1978, cheques written on the general account exceeded deposits by $11,669.50. The trust account was similarly overdrawn by $2,233.26, and theU.S.account by $1,037.85. A later reconciliation indicated that as ofFebruary 22, 1978, the general account was overdrawn by $11,796.28, and theU.S.account by $1,405.88, while in the trust account there remained a positive balance of $2,432.83. After the February reconciliation the appellant directed that these monthly reports cease; he was more [Page 63] interested in the amount of funds on deposit from day to day at the bank than in the total overdraft picture. ... From May until approximately the middle of June, the company was in a very difficult financial position, with a great deal of pressure for payment from every side. It further appears that from February 1978 on, by which time the accounts were generally in an overdraft position, (that is, there were more cheques outstanding than there was money in the accounts), that the Appellant determined which cheques of those outstanding, the bank should honour. Loretta Ann McMillan, an employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia gave this evidence: All right, and were there other cheques in the group that went in with the $2,000 cheque? Yes, there was. What happened to those other cheques? The $404 which made up the other cheques in the group were returned. For what reason? Non-sufficient funds. Can you tell me why the $2,000 would go through and the other cheques totalling $404 would not go through? Well, when R.B. & C. Travel Agencies account was overdrawn, the next morning when Mr. Lowden came in he would put in enough money to cover certain cheques and they were the ones that got paid and the rest were returned. Who would decide which cheques would be paid and which ones would be returned?",

Can you tell us when N.S.F. cheques were started in 1978 with respect to the statements of account? In February. And did they continue from that time on? Yes, they did. The cheque, exhibit 38, referred to in McMillan's evidence, was dated June 13, 1978. It was for $2,000.00 and the payee was the Appellant. It was cashed by the bank rather than other cheques, on the direction of the Appellant. The proceeds were handed to the Appellant in cash. The eight counts before the Court arise out of similar circumstances: It will be sufficient for illustration pur- [Page 64] poses to review the facts which gave rise to Counts #1,2 and 3. These counts relate to the Perrys'. OnJanuary 27th, 1978, Noreen Perry attended at the offices of R.B. & C. Agencies Limited and booked a European tour for herself and her husband, with a departure date of July 29th, 1978. She deposited $100.00. On February 2nd she returned and booked two tours for her son and daughter, paying a $200.00 deposit. Those deposits were duly paid by R.B. & C. Agencies Limited to hold the reservations. Later, the daughter sent to Mrs. Perry a cheque datedMay 15, 1978in the sum of $1,044.00. Perry turned that over to the agency on May 24th, 1978. The cheque, payable to Mrs. Perry although, apparently not endorsed, was deposited to the company's bank account onMay 25th, 1978. Perry's son sent her a bank draft which was turned over to the company on May 25th, 1978. It appears that the proceeds of this draft also went into the company's bank account. Finally, Mrs. Perry turned over to the company her own cheque for $266.00 and her husband's cheque in the amount of $260.00. Her cheque was dated June 9th and her husband's cheque was dated June 7th. They were both deposited to the company's account onJune 12th, 1978. It appears that cheques were drawn on behalf of the company to cover the payments entitled to be made on behalf of the Perrys', but the cheques were never signed. At the end of June, 1978, Mrs. Perry returned to the offices of R.B. & C. Agencies Limited to pick up the tickets, only to find the premises closed.",

She and her husband never took their tour. The $100.00 deposit was transferred to the credit of the son's and daughter's tour. The balance owing on the latter tours—the sum of $1,980.00 was paid by the Perrys' directly to the tour operator. The operator's representative testified at trial that only the $300.00 in deposits was ever received from the appellant's agency. As I have mentioned above, the circumstances leading up to the other five counts were similar, each involving a payment to the company in May or June of 1978 for travel arrangements, be they transportation or accommodation or both, and a deposit by the Appellant to the company's bank account. In all cases the arrangements were not made by R.B. & C., and the complainant either had to pay the operator directly, or to forego his travel plans. All complainants were reimbursed by the Appellant after the preliminary inquiry in this matter. [Page 65] Appellant comes to this Court as of right under s. 618(1)(a) of theCriminal Code. 618.(1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada; (a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or ...

On the evening of November 15, 1978, Gee, a male prostitute and female impersonator, Fife, a prostitute, and one Paul Racz met at Gee's house for drinks before going into the street for the purposes of prostitution. As the weather was inclement the respondent made arrangements for the three of them to go to the home of the deceased, David Powley, who was known to the respondent and described by him as a \"kinky trick who had lots of money\". When they arrived they had some more drinks at the bar and then proceeded to an upstairs bedroom. What happened thereafter is described in a statement given by the respondent to the police, a short resumé of which is as follows. Powley suggested that Racz dress up in women's lingerie which Racz hesitatingly agreed to do. Gee and Fife looked for other lingerie. The statement continues: \"The next thing I knew, I heard a smash and we turned around and David and Paul were wrestling. I think Paul tried to knock him out by hitting him over the head with a bottle\". Gee and Fife struck Powley over the head numerous times with objects, including bottles, a frying pan and a lamp. When they ceased Powley was dead. The theory of the Crown was that the killing was the result of a planned robbery which Powley had resisted. The theory of the defence was that Powley attacked Racz and was committing an assault upon him; the respondent and Fife were attempting to prevent the commission of that offence and killed Powley in the process.",

[The underlining is mine] In the same case, Mr. Justice Dickson went on to say: Offences which are criminal in the true sense fall in the first category. Public welfare offences wouldprima faciebe in the second category. They are not subject to the presumption of fullmens rea.An offence of this type would fall in the first category only if such words as \"wilfully,\" \"with intent,\" \"knowingly,\" or \"intentionally\" are contained in the statutory provision creating the offence. On the other hand, the principle that punishment should in general not be inflicted on those without fault applies. Offences of absolute liability would be those in respect of which the Legislature had made it clear that guilt would follow proof merely of the proscribed act. The overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature, the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the precision of the language used will be primary considerations in determining whether the offence falls into the third category. I am in agreement with all of the judges in the courts below, including the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, in finding that as the offence here charged is one concerning the public welfare it was properly characterized as \"an offence of strict liability\" within the meaning of the classification stipulated by Mr. Justice Dickson (supra)and that a defence is accordingly available to the accused if he \"reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render\" his act in continuing to drive his motor vehicle without a licence, an innocent one.

After the appellants had entered their respective pleas of not guilty, and after twelve jurors were sworn, but before the appellants had been given in charge to the jury and before the Crown was called upon to present its case, the court was informed that one of the jurors was a fellow employee of the brother of the alleged victim. The prosecutor suggested that the options were \"to simply say goodbye\" to that one juror under s. 573(1) of theCriminal Codeor to discharge the jury if there was a chance that the entire jury had been \"poisoned\" in the jury room. Counsel representing both appellants then indicated he had similar concerns about the balance of the jury, agreeing that the juror in question should be removed from the jury. The particular juror was then questioned briefly by the judge and by counsel for the appellants as to comments he might have made to other jurors. Following this, the judge excused the juror and asked for submissions as to whether the trial should be continued with eleven jurors. In his submission, counsel for the appellants applied for a mistrial on the ground that the balance of the jury may have been tainted. This application was denied. [Page 733] The following day the jury was instructed as to the charge facing the appellants and the plea which had been given by each upon arraignment. The appellants were then put in the charge of the jury and the trial proceeded with eleven jurors.

Counsel contended that a jury trial does not commence until the accused has been placed in the charge of the jury and therefore the discharge of the juror did not take place during the \"course\" of the trial, as provided in s. 573(1).

Dennis[[1960] S.C.R. 286] the word \"trial\" has a somewhat more restricted meaning in a trial involving a jury. To what extent is the word restricted—does the trial begin when (1) the jury has been empanelled, (2) the accused has been given in charge to jury, (3) when the Crown begins to adduce evidence? I have concluded that for the purposes of s. 573(1) a trial commences when a jury has been empanelled and is ready to hear the case and does not commence only after the accused has been given in charge to the jury. I do not think that anything said by Ritchie J., inR. v. Dennisprecludes me from adopting this view. The Court of Appeal rejected all other grounds of appeal and the appeals were dismissed. Before this Court counsel, who were not the counsel at trial, have advanced four grounds. Counsel submitted,inter aliathat the trial judge had erred in discharging the juror under the provisions of s. 573(1) because the discharge did not arise in the \"course\" of the trial, counsel contending that in the case of a jury trial the trial does not commence until the accused has been placed in the charge of the jury. At the conclusion of argument Mr. Justice Ritchie, presiding, delivered the following oral judgment for the Court: [Page 734] We are all of the view that the Court of Appeal of British Columbia erred in its interpretation of s. 573(1) and s. 573(2) of theCriminal Codewith respect to the question of when a trial before a jury commenced. The appeal is accordingly allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside and a new trial ordered. Reasons for judgment will follow at a later date. Hence these reasons.",

    "text": "But I'd like to put before you now the elements that come to my mind which can, if you accept them and believe them, serve as corroboration in the direct evidence given by Danielson and Dinneen. [My emphasis] Appellants are challenging this procedure, which was approved by the Court of Appeal for Quebec, arguing, with the support of the Court of Appeal for Ontario inR. v. Racine[1], that the judge not only had a duty to indicate to the jury what evidence in the case at bar was capable of constituting corroboration, but also had to tell them that they should confine themselves to the points he had indicated to them and should not, as he did, have left them free to search through other parts of the evidence, using his definition of corroborative evidence. There is however another ground raised by appellants and which was pleaded as an alternative, and which is more a matter particular to the facts of this case than one of principle. When arguing his case before the jury, counsel for the Crown indicated to the jurors as being capable of providing corroboration evidence which, as a matter of law, could not; this was acknowledged by respondent Crown. [Page 443] The trial judge, who had left the jurors free to find corroboration in parts of the evidence other than those which he had indicated, did not instruct them that the parts of the evidence which the Crown had suggested as being capable of providing corroboration in fact could not, and that they were not entitled to regard them as such. It is for this reason that appellants now argue before us that, even assuming that the judge committed no error of law by proceeding as he did, he should have—and not having done so was a fatal error on his part—nevertheless warned the jurors that they could not accept the Crown's suggestion as regards the corroborative value of those passages of the evidence. With this I agree. It is therefore not necessary to deal with the main ground of appeal.",

The apartment was equipped with audio-visual recording equipment installed in a wall. Prior to the installation of the equipment, the informer and the undercover officer consented to the interception of their conversations, pursuant to the provisions of s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. As a result of the operation, the undercover officer met a man named Paul Vidotto. Some days after the meeting, Vidotto, the appellant Mario Duarte, and two others attended at the apartment and discussed a cocaine transaction with the undercover officer and the informer. The undercover officer made notes of these and a subsequent conversation which he acknowledged were based upon a review of the tapes of the conversations. The appellant was later charged with the offence of conspiracy to import a narcotic. At trial, he challenged, on avoir dire, the validity of s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCodewhich excepts from the prohibition of unauthorized electronic surveillance, the interception of conversations to which one of the parties consents. The trial judge, Trotter J., held that the actions of the authorities infringed the appellant's rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure unders. 8of theCharterand that the evidence thereby obtained was held not admissible. The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal which unanimously allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial. In reasons that I shall review later, Cory J.A. (as he then was) following American authorities dealing with the Fourth Amendment to the American Constitution, concluded that the interception of private conversations without a warrant but with the consent of one of the participants does not violates. 8of theCharter((1987), 61 O.R.

The Attorneys General for Ontario and Quebec intervened to support the constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a). During the argument, counsel for the appellant, however, advanced the position that the constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a) might not really arise. That provision, he noted, was really an exception to the criminal prohibition against the interception of private communications set forth in s. 178.11(1), an exception applicable both to the police and members of the public. Action contemplated by that exception could not be made criminal by aCharterattack on its validity. The real question, then, becomes whether, even though such action may not constitute a criminal offence, it would nonetheless, when undertaken by an instrumentality of the state, such as the police, violates. 8of theCharter.

Evidence at trial showed that the appellant had contacted a person by the name of Mr. Seed, who, unknown to the appellant, was a police informer, and asked him if he would like to invest in the scheme. The informer told police about this conversation and, at their request, had further conversations with the appellant while wearing a \"body pack\", i.e., an electromagnetic transmitter, which transmitted the conversations to the police who simultaneously recorded them. The informer was given \"seed money\" by the police which he, in turn, gave to the appellant as an \"investment\" in the scheme. In one taped conversation, the appellant told the informer how the narcotics were obtained, that they were welded into the hull of the vessel, and how they were transported and hidden upon his reaching British Columbia. The police conducted searches of the appellant's vessel but found no narcotics and no evidence to support the appellant's detailed account of how the narcotics had been hidden in British Columbia. At the conclusion of the trial, counsel for the appellant explained to the jury the defence theory that the appellant was lying to the informer about the narcotics being welded into the hull of the vessel and about the manner in which it had been hidden. The appellant did not testify. The trial judge gave his charge to the jury on the same day the defence made its submissions. He indicated that he would not repeat the theories of the parties as they had been well covered by the parties' counsel. The appellant was convicted of conspiring to import a narcotic contrary to s. 423(1)(d) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. The appellant then appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.

The appellant's various grounds of appeal were similarly rejected. The first -‐ that the trial judge erred in failing to put the theory of the defence to the jury -‐ failed because the court found this to be one of those rare cases recognized inAzoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, where it was not necessary for the judge to do so. The second issue -‐ whether the trial judge erred in admitting the appellant's passport into evidence on the ground that a passport deposited with the police under the terms of his judicial interim release does not become available as evidence -‐ was disposed of on the simple ground that it was too late to raise the objection. The third ground of appeal was that the appellant's privacy was invaded by the recording of his conversations with the informer. The court cited with approval the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Sanelli(1987), 60 C.R. (3d) 142, in which it was held that s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Codedid not contravenes. 8of theCharterand that there was no \"reasonable expectation of privacy in the course of a conversation where one party to it has consented to it being intercepted and recorded\". The court noted that the law does not require that \"when the police are aware that someone is about to divulge a private matter to another they must seek judicial authorization before that other person may listen to what is said or secretly record what is said\". The court also rejected this ground of appeal. On the appeal to this Court, the same issues were raised but the appellant in addition argued that the Crown had suppressed evidence of the vessel's stability information booklet which, it was alleged, would support the appellant's case.",

    "text": "The facts out of which this issue arose are not in dispute and may be summarized as follows. The appellants Langlois and Bédard are constables employed by the police department of the Montréal Urban Community. The respondent Cloutier is a lawyer practising in that city. On November 3, 1983, early in the evening, the respondent made a right turn from the centre lane of St‐Denis Street in Montréal. In so doing, the respondent's vehicle passed directly in front of a police vehicle parked at the street corner. The constables decided that the respondent's turn was in breach of a municipal by‐law, stopped him and asked for his driver's licence and other documents for identification purposes. As conceded by the respondent in this Court, [TRANSLATION] \"the tone became somewhat heated\" during this exchange. While constable Langlois was writing up a notice of violation, officer Bédard learned by radio contact with police headquarters that a warrant of committal had been issued against the respondent in the Municipal Court for unpaid traffic fines. The constables informed the respondent and asked him to accompany them to the police station. When they asked the respondent to get into the patrol car, the constables carried out a \"frisk\" search: the hands of the accused were placed on the hood of the car, his legs spread and the constables patted him down. The respondent was then taken to the police station. Subsequent to these events the respondent, relying on the provisions of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‐34, dealing with summary convictions, filed an information against each of the police officers for common assault, contrary tos. 245(b) of theCriminal Code. The primary allegation made by the respondent in his pleading was that the arrest was illegal, since the police officers had no power to arrest him unless they had actual possession of the arrest warrant issued by the Municipal Court. The respondent also argued incidentally that the police officers were not authorized to search him. He contended that the arrest and the search constituted assaults within the meaning of theCriminal Code. However, in the course of events, the respondent's incidental submission became his principal argument.",

Wray[25],in which Martland J., speaking for the majority, said at p. 295: In my opinion, the recognition of a discretion to exclude admissible evidence, beyond the limited scope recognized in theNoor Mohamedcase, is not warranted by authority, and would be undesirable. The admission of relevant admissible evidence of probative value should [Page 359] not be prevented, except within the very limited sphere recognized in that case. It is true that in that case the issue was the admissibility of facts discovered through a statement of the accused held to be inadmissible, and not the admissibility of similar facts. However, the long citations fromThompsonandNoor Mohamed,and the indirect reference toMakin,convince me that evidence of similar facts is admissible, not to prove commission of the crime mentioned in the indictment but to establish guilty intent. Did the trial judge in the case at bar make the necessary distinction and give the jury the necessary instructions? The answer to this question must be in the affirmative, if we consider for example the following passages from the judge's charge to the jury: [TRANSLATION] YOU must forget for the moment the evidence of similar acts, because he is not on trial for having committed those acts. Thus, you must make a distinction. That evidence was only admitted in order to support evidence of the accused's intention to act as he did on July 3, 1968, with respect to Normand and Giguère, and to preclude a defence that the descent towards the persons on the ground was due to mechanical failure, or to fortuitous causes beyond the pilot's control. ... Similar acts are acts of the same type as one of the essential elements of the crime charged. For there to be a crime in the case at bar it is necessary for the death to have been caused by criminal negligence within the meaning of s. 191. These acts, then, are acts of the same type, evidence of which was designed to refute a defence that the accused might otherwise have put forward.",

Titchener[26].However, appellant, on the basis of the decision inTitchener,submitted that the trial judge did not make it sufficiently clear to the jury that a mere breach of the Act and Regulations was not necessarily proof of the \"wanton or reckless disregard\" required by the definition of the crime of criminal negligence. In this regard, I have nothing to add to the following comments of Salvas J.A., speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal (at p. 63): [TRANSLATION] The trial lasted approximately three weeks. The investigation included evidence of many facts not related, or not important, to the point at issue, as well as statements of hypotheses also without significance. Under these circumstances, it was particularly important to present the point at issue squarely to the jurors, and especially to avoid any prejudice to the accused.

    "text": "Here the reason given by the trial judge is legally unavailable against the accused. He cannot be held responsible for the fact that \"too many [Page 125] cases are postponed when lawyers ... absent themselves\". When the learned judge adds that the accused \"may not delay cases of his own accord\", he is without any evidence laying the blame for the fault of counsel on the accused. The situation is quite different from that dealt with by this Court inSpataro v. Regina[2],where after the jury was sworn in, the accused without any valid reason claimed the right to dismiss his counsel, and thus obtain an adjournment. It is true that a decision on an application for adjournment is in the judge's discretion. It is, however, a judicial discretion so that his decision may be reviewed on appeal if it is based on reasons which are not well founded in law. This right of review is especially wide when the consequence of the exercise of discretion is that someone is deprived of his rights, whether in criminal or in civil proceedings. At a glance, I have found in the last few years no less than half a dozen judgments in civil proceedings where a decision depriving a litigant of an important right was reversed on account of insufficient reasons given. (Frank v. Alpert[3]; Basarsky v. Quinlan[4]; Ladouceur v. Howarth[5]; Whitco Chemical Co. v. Oakville[6]; General Foods v. Struthers[7]; Hamel v. Brunelle[8]). This being so in civil proceedings, there is all the more reason to so regard a discretionary decision in criminal proceedings, the effect whereof is to deprive the accused of his right to obtain the assistance of counsel and to summon witnesses in his defence. This principle is fully recognized in the English case law which was cited to us. Thus, inMary Kingston[9],where the case proceeded in the absence of counsel retained by the accused, and the judge had refused the suggestion of Crown prosecutor that other counsel be invited to provide services immediately, the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and said (at p. 188): [Page 126] it seems to us that that was tantamount to depriving the appellant of the right which she had of being defended by counsel.",

    "text": "As to the English judgments where the Court refused to quash the conviction of accused persons deprived of the services of counsel, it must not be overlooked that until quite recently in England the quashing of a verdict by the Court of Appeal meant the definitive acquittal of the accused, as was noted with regret inMary Kingston.It is understandable that in such circumstances there was a tendency to apply as often as possible the provision which allows a conviction to be upheld, despite an error of law, if it is found that there has been no miscarriage of justice. This concern is apparent inDonald Winston Sowden[10]. The Court of first instance had refused to issue a second legal aid certificate after the first counsel appointed was authorized to withdraw. A conviction for fraud was quashed but a conviction for breach of theRoad Traffic Actwas upheld, on the grounds that this was a very simple case where the absence of counsel could not have caused any prejudice. As to the case ofLacey and Wright[11],of which the brief summary published in [1966] Crim. L.R. 387 was cited to this Court, it is necessary to read the complete text of the judgment rendered by Parker C.J. It will be seen that the Court did not, in the circumstances, find it necessary to consider whether it was certain that the accused had suffered no prejudice from the denial of legal aid, because it came to the conclusion that this discretionary denial was not reviewable. In the case at bar, I cannot hold that the accused suffered no prejudice by being forced to defend himself without enjoying the assistance of counsel, and without being able to summon as a witness a person having knowledge of the incident which led up to the conviction. When the case against the accused is such that he cannot defend himself without testifying, he certainly is in great need of the assistance of counsel. When he denies in his testimony a significant part of what the witnesses for the prosecution relate against him, in [Page 127] this case a blow delivered to an officer, it appears to me impossible to find that the absence of a possible witness was definitely not prejudicial. It is true that counsel for the prosecution treated the accused with consideration.",

Even if he thus did what was within his power to attenuate the consequences of the situation created by the erroneous decision of the trial judge, I cannot find that the accused, who was sentenced to a year in prison, had a fair trial. The following words of Addy J. inR. v. Lane and Ross[12]were cited to the Court (at p. 278): There would also be a miscarriage of justice when a person who is evidently guilty is found not guilty, for, in the administration of justice, there is a duty not only to the accused but to society for the protection of which laws have been enacted. Without embarking on a discussion of this statement, I cannot be satisfied that appellant here is manifestly guilty, when the evidence for the defence is incomplete and imperfect as a result of the absence of counsel and of a witness. It appears to me that in the case at bar, the principle to be followed is as stated by the Court of Appeal of Quebec inTalbot v. Regina[13]: though our courts have not yet gone as far as to hold that the fact that the accused was not represented by an attorney, for reasons other than his own choice, meansper sethat he has not had the opportunity to make a full answer and defence, it appears that, if the offence was serious enough to warrant a sentence of six months imprisonment, it was serious enough to warrant that the appellant be allowed to be defended by a lawyer if he so wished. For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal, quash the conviction against appellant and order a new trial. The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by DE GRANDPRE J. (dissenting)—Appellant was convicted by a judge sitting alone of having com- [Page 128] mitted an assault on the person of a peace officer, and applied to the Court of Appeal for a new trial, because he was denied an adjournment by the trial judge when his lawyer was occupied elsewhere.",

    "text": "This appeal was dismissed, the two judges of the majority holding that \"Barrette, even though not represented by counsel, was given the opportunity to make a full defence and he received a fair trial\". The dissenting judge, however, was of the opinion that Barrette had not received \"the full and fair trial to which he is entitled\". The basic facts are related in the report prepared by the trial judge, cited at length by Pigeon J. in his reasons. From this report and the other facts disclosed by the record, I wish to stress in particular: (1) the date of the trial was fixed some five months in advance and until 10:15 on the morning of the trial, no one had mentioned a postponement; (2) the defence had not summoned any witnesses; (3) on the morning of the trial, as the record shows, the articling student of the lawyer chosen by the accused was present but he did not make any representation, although the By-laws of the Bar Association permitted him not only to present reasons in support of the application for a postponement but also, if need be, to conduct the defence; (4) while the judge showed some impatience with the conduct of the accused's lawyer, in other respects he directed the trial perfectly; thus he refused to allow the Crown to file photographs which were not provided by a qualified witness; (5) the accused was able to cross-examine Crown witnesses; (6) the accused testified and was not cross-examined; (7) the only witness who apparently could have been heard in order to complete knowledge of the facts was the companion of the accused; at best, he could only have corroborated the latter; [Page 129] (8) Barrette's record of previous convictions was not placed before the judge before the guilty verdict. The question in this appeal, which of course can only raise a question of law, is as to whether a miscarriage of justice was perpetrated by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion, when he refused to grant the application for postponement which Barrette made in the absence of his lawyer. That is the criterion of s. 613 of theCriminal Codewhich this Court upheld in two decisions which resemble the case at bar because they deal with the fundamental rights of the accused:Vescio v.",

The King[14],andSpataro v. The Queen[15],to which both parties have referred us. The decision of the trial judge was weighed by the Court of Appeal and found to be in accordance with the relevant rules. In any matter where the judgment at first instance is upheld by the Court of Appeal, this Court must interfere only if it is clear that the judgmenta quois based on an error of principle. We must be particularly aware of this rule when the decisiona quohas been pronounced in the exercise of a discretion which presupposes an intimate knowledge of the local situation. That such knowledge played a major role in the case at bar is evident from comparison of the decisiona quowithTalbot v. The Queen[16], in both cases the Chief Justice and Owen J. were on the bench; here, they held that there was no miscarriage of justice, whereas inTalbot,they reached the opposite conclusion because the facts as a whole showed that the accused had not been able to present a full and complete defence. There are no decisions of this Court exactly in point. Reference must be made to the case law of the Court of Appeal of England for examples which can enlighten us and enable the Court to decide whether the courts of Quebec have committed a miscarriage of justice which would permit us to intervene. [Page 130] InMary Kingston[17], theaccused's lawyer was not present in court on the morning of the trial because he was erroneously under the impression that the case would not be called before the afternoon. The Crown itself suggested that the case be adjourned and when this suggestion was rejected, added that another lawyer present could represent the accused. This suggestion in its turn having been ignored, the accused was not represented during the trial, and she chose not to cross-examine and not to offer her own testimony.

    "text": "From the reasons of Humphreys J., speaking for the Court, I take this extract (at p. 187): We have had a report in this case from the learned Recorder of Manchester, and it is quite clear from that report that the primary cause of this unfortunate situation was the failure of the counsel who had been briefed to do his duty to his client and the Court in attending when the case was in the list for trial. If he was unable for any good reason to attend, his duty, as everybody knows, was to see that some other member of the Bar held his brief and was in a position to represent the accused person. It was owing to the fact that that member of the Bar agreed with counsel for the prosecution that neither would go to the Court till 2 p.m. that all this trouble arose. In those circumstances, we think it right to say that in our opinion the Assistant-Recorder was perfectly justified in continuing with the trial of a person although she was unrepresented. The jury had to be considered. It would have been quite wrong for the Assistant-Recorder at 10.30 a.m. to waste the jury's time and tell them there was nothing for them to do and that they must come back at 2 p.m. for the convenience of counsel. No application had been made to the Court to fix the case for 2 p.m. or postpone it in any way. If the matter rested on the facts which I have stated so far, this Court would not have interfered, ... The only reason for the intervention of the Court of Appeal was the decision of the trial judge not to allow another lawyer to represent the accused. AlthoughHowes[18],belongs to the area of legislation on legal aid in England, it is of relevance here. Two paragraphs of the headnote describe the problem: [Page 131] The appellant, who was charged with a serious offence, applied to quarter sessions for legal aid, but was refused. At the trial he obtained a dock brief, but the counsel whom he had selected returned the brief without informing the court.",

At the opening of the trial the appellant, who was then unrepresented, owing to a misunderstanding, did not apply for a dock brief, but did so in the course of the trial. The Deputy-Chairman, who did not realise the actual position, refused the application, and the appellant conducted his own defence. The case against him was an extremely strong one. Heldthat, as in the opinion of the court representation of the appellant by counsel could not have produced a different result, no miscarriage of justice had resulted despite the fact that the appellant was unrepresented, and the conviction must be affirmed. Before the Court of Appeal, the accused submitted that the assistance of a lawyer would have had the result that: (a) the police officer could have been subjected to cross-examination; (b) the evidence would not have been presented in such a way as to suggest that he had a record of past convictions; (c) the tone of the cross-examination to which he himself was subjected might have been different. Lord Parker C.J. stated as follows the question now before this Court (at p. 179): The court has considered all those matters. The real question at the end of the day is whether the court is completely satisfied that, notwithstanding the unfortunate course this case took in regard to the appellant not being represented, there has been no miscarriage of justice. If there is the slightest doubt in the matter, then the court ought to quash the conviction. And the Court held (at p. 180): ...that there is no reason to interfere at all, that really the case was overwhelming, and that no counsel could have produced any different result. [Page 132] The same year, inSowden[19],the Court of Appeal studied two convictions which had resulted in sentences of three years and six months respectively. It dismissed the first and upheld the second.

The appellant really ought to have been legally represented if his case was to be put properly. Mr. Hazan has taken other points, that it might be that further evidence could have been called if he had been legally represented, and matters of that sort. It is sufficient to say that this court is not satisfied, that if he had been represented, the result must have been the same. As to the second conviction, however, the Chief Justice, after having stressed that it was a simple matter, a \"hopeless case\", concluded (at p. 41): It does not seem to this court that any legal representation could conceivably have made any difference... Two years later, inLacey[20],the Court of Appeal refused to interfere with a conviction which had resulted in a sentence of three years. I do not wish to encumber these reasons by referring to the facts. I need only once again cite Lord Parker C.J., who asks the question which the Court must answer (at p. 210): This court finds it quite unnecessary to consider the position that would have emerged if these appellants had had legal aid. No doubt, the course of the trial would have been different from what it was, but it is by no means clear that the result would not have been exactly the same. The court finds it unnecessary to go into that matter, for the simple reason that the first step in the argument must be to satisfy the court that the Deputy Chairman wrongly exercised his discretion by refusing legal aid. [Page 133] And the Court found that there was no reason to intervene in such a discretionary matter. It is, therefore, with a great deal of hesitation that the Court of Appeal of England intervenes in cases such as that now before the Court.",

That Court is a first court of appeal, which has a much freer hand than we do. Furthermore, it must be emphasized that in each of these cases the trial took place a short time after criminal proceedings were instituted; in none of them did such a considerable length of time elapse as the period of five months in the case at bar. The parties have also referred us to the decision of the Privy Council,Galos Hired v. The King[21].I do not see how this decision applies. It suffices to point out that this was a matter of a sentence of death for murder, that the absence of the lawyer before the Court of Appeal was due to unforeseeable circumstances caused by the war, and that the accused had to present his own case even though he was not prepared to do so. On the whole, I am of the opinion that the judgmenta quois not in error. The right to the presence of counsel is a right which has limits, and the administration of justice requires that society be protected as well. The accused has not convinced me that the presence of his lawyer would have changed the outcome, indeed to the contrary. I would dismiss the appeal.

In the early hours of August 31 after most of the guests had departed the appellant and Rust had an argument in the upstairs bedroom which was used by the appellant. Rust was killed by a single shot in the back of the head from a .303 calibre rifle fired by the appellant as he was leaving the room. The appellant did not testify but her statement made to police on the night of the shooting was put in evidence. Portions of it read as follows: Me and Wendy argued as usual and I ran in the house after Kevin pushed me. I was scared, I was really scared. I locked the door. Herb was downstairs with Joanne and I called for Herb but I was crying when I called him. I said, \"Herb come up here please.\" Herb came up to the top of the stairs and I told him that Kevin was going to hit me actually beat on me again. Herb said he knew and that if I was his old lady things would be different, he gave me a hug. OK, we're friends, there's nothing between us. He said \"Yeah, I know\" and he went outside to talk to Kevin leaving the door unlocked. I went upstairs and hid in my closet from Kevin. I was so scared... . My window was open and I could hear Kevin asking questions about what I was doing and what I was saying. Next thing I know he was coming up the stairs for me. He came into my bedroom and said \"Wench, where are you?\" And he turned on my light and he said \"Your purse is on the floor\" and he kicked it. OK then he turned and he saw me in the closet.

All I thought about was all the other times he used to beat me, I was scared, I was shaking as usual. The rest is a blank, all I remember is he gave me the gun and a shot was fired through my screen. This is all so fast. And then the guns were in another room and he loaded it the second shot and gave it to me. And I was going to shoot myself. I pointed it to myself, I was so upset. OK and then he went and I was sitting on the bed and he started going like this with his finger [the appellant made a shaking motion with an index finger] and said something like \"You're my old lady and you do as you're told\" or something like that. He said \"wait till everybody leaves, you'll get it then\" and he said something to the effect of \"either you kill me or I'll get you\" that was what it was. He kind of smiled and then he turned around. I shot him but I aimed out. I thought I aimed above him and a piece of his head went that way. The relationship between the appellant and Rust was volatile and punctuated by frequent arguments and violence. They would apparently fight for two or three days at a time or several times a week. Considerable evidence was led at trial indicating that the appellant was frequently a victim of physical abuse at the hands of Rust. Between 1983 and 1986 the appellant made several trips to hospital for injuries including severe bruises, a fractured nose, multiple contusions and a black eye.

He also saw the appellant with a black eye on one occasion and doubted that it was the result of an accident as she and the deceased stated at the time. Another acquaintance of the couple recalled seeing the appellant with a split lip. At one point on the night of his death Rust chased the appellant outside the house and a mutual friend, Norman Kolish, testified that the appellant pleaded with Rust to \"leave me alone\" and sought Kolish's protection by trying to hide behind him. A neighbour overheard Rust and the appellant arguing and described the tone of the former as \"argumentative\" and the latter as \"scared\".

Another neighbour testified to hearing noises like gunshots and then a woman's voice sounding upset saying \"Fuck. He punched me in the face.

I hope he lives. I really love him,\" and \"He told me he was gonna kill me when everyone left.\" The police officer who took the appellant's statement testified to seeing a red mark on her arm where she said the deceased had grabbed her.

Another doctor noted an injury to the appellant's pinkie finger consistent with those sustained by the adoption of a defensive stance. The expert evidence which forms the subject matter of the appeal came from Dr. Fred Shane, a psychiatrist with extensive professional experience in the treatment of battered wives. At the request of defence counsel Dr. Shane prepared a psychiatric assessment of the appellant. The substance of Dr. Shane's opinion was that the appellant had been terrorized by Rust to the point of feeling trapped, vulnerable, worthless and unable to escape the relationship despite the violence. At the same time, the continuing pattern of abuse put her life in danger. In Dr. Shane's opinion the appellant's shooting of the deceased was a final desperate act by a woman who sincerely believed that she would be killed that night: ... I think she felt, she felt in the final tragic moment that her life was on the line, that unless she defended herself, unless she reacted in a violent way that she would die.",

Dr. Shane stated that his opinion was based on four hours of formal interviews with the appellant, a police report of the incident (including the appellant's statement), hospital reports documenting eight of her visits to emergency departments between 1983 and 1985, and an interview with the appellant's mother. In the course of his testimony Dr. Shane related many things told to him by the appellant for which there was no admissible evidence. They were not in the appellant's statement to the police and she did not testify at trial. For example, Dr. Shane mentioned several episodes of abuse described by the appellant for which there were no hospital reports. He also related the appellant's disclosure to him that she had lied to doctors about the cause of her injuries. Dr. Shane testified that such fabrication was typical of battered women. The appellant also recounted to Dr. Shane occasions on which Rust would allegedly beat her, then beg her forgiveness and ply her with flowers and temporary displays of kindness. Dr. Shane was aware of the incidents described by Ezako about the appellant's pointing a gun at Rust on two occasions and explained it as \"an issue for trying to defend herself. She was afraid that she would be assaulted.\" The appellant denied to Dr. Shane that she had homicidal fantasies about Rust and mentioned that she had smoked some marijuana on the night in question. These facts were related by Dr. Shane in the course of his testimony. The appellant was acquitted by a jury but the verdict was overturned by a majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal and the case sent back for retrial.",

The trial judge found no evidence of wounding and therefore considered only the included offences of sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm. The complainant, D.M., a kindergarten student at Sheho Elementary School, was five years old at the time of the alleged offence. He gave unsworn testimony at the trial. He testified that during the afternoon recess on May 9, 1986, when he left his classroom to get a drink of water, the appellant grabbed him and carried him to the janitor's room located next to the senior boys' washroom. According to the complainant the appellant then pulled down the complainant's pants, pulled and twisted his penis, injuring him, and leaving him in the janitor's room. There were some discrepancies at trial with respect to the complainant's evidence as to the perpetrator(s) involved but the complainant consistently included the appellant and claimed that he was the one who assaulted him in the janitor's room. P.M., the older brother of the victim, also gave unsworn evidence at trial. He testified that he had seen someone he could not identify take his brother into the janitor's room. After that person left, P.M. said that he let his brother out of the janitor's room and that D.M. then returned to his classroom. Seidlick, the complainant's kindergarten teacher, testified that on the day in question she noticed the complainant lying down on the carpet in the classroom away from the other students. She also noticed that he was upset and when she tried to find out what was bothering him he complained of soreness. She further testified that the complainant had informed her that the big boys had hurt him and that he had named the appellant as one of the students involved. D.M's parents testified as to his physical and emotional condition on the evening of the alleged offence. D.M. had complained to his father of a stomachache.",

The complainant, E.G., a student at Sheho Elementary School, was seven years old at the time of the alleged offence and eight years old at the time of the trial. She was sworn in by the trial judge. Her evidence was to the effect that sometime during the noon break during the wintertime when she was in grade one she had been dragged into the boys' washroom by the three appellants and pushed into a cubicle. She was told to pull down her pants and was touched in the area of her \"bum\" and her \"pee-pee\" by the appellants. On cross-examination she affirmed that the incident occurred when she was in grade one and she implicated other youths as parties to the alleged offence in addition to the appellants. At trial the appellants pointed out that the complainant was in grade one in the fall of 1984 and that the information alleged that the offence took place in December of 1985. The Crown submitted, however, that there was other relevant evidence as to the date of the offence and that the complainant's testimony that the incident occurred in grade one must be viewed in light of all the evidence. The evidence included: 1.The floorplan of the school showed that grades 1 and 2 were in the same room. 2.The complainant identified the washroom close to her classroom when she was in grade 2 as the room in which the assault took place. 3.The complainant also testified that she did not know the year in which the assault took place but that her mother was working at the bakery in Foam Lake at the time. 4.The complainant's mother testified that her daughter experienced various problems such as bed-wetting and nightmares during the late months of 1985 and the early months of 1986. She further testified that this stopped abruptly once the complainant spoke with the investigating officer.",

The two key witnesses for the Crown were S.M., the complainant, and C.Z., a co-accused and accomplice who had previously entered a plea of guilty to the same charge prior to trial. S.M. was eight years old at the time of the alleged offence and nine years old at the time of the trial. C.Z. was fourteen years old at the time of trial. Both witnesses were duly sworn by the trial judge. The complainant identified C.Z. and each of the appellants as participants in the alleged assault. He testified that he thought the offence occurred in September of 1985. When cross-examined, however, he was uncertain when the incident occurred and agreed with defence counsel's suggestion that it may have been after Easter and thus in the spring of 1986. The trial judge summarized S.M.'s testimony as follows: I was coming out of the bathroom, G.B. kicked the door open and pushed me back, and they sweared at me -- pulled my pants down and shoved a pencil in my bum and there was blood running out of my bum, and there was blood on the pencil. They pulled my penis and they pulled down their pants, and they forced me to pull their penis -- and banged my head against the wall and broke my glasses. C.Z. gave similar evidence. He testified that he and the appellants came across the complainant in the school washroom just before recess, each kicked the complainant, put a pencil in the complainant's bum, and touched his penis. He testified that he did not recall seeing the appellants' penises at any time. With respect to the time of the offence C.Z. testified that the incident occurred between September 1 and September 30 of 1985 but could not remember if it was the beginning, middle, or end of September.",

The father testified that he had had the complainant's glasses repaired in September of 1985. The only other clear evidence of S.M. breaking his glasses was an incident later in the winter when the lens popped out during gym class after an incident with another student. The appellants all testified and denied that they had sexually assaulted the complainant at any time. The defence also called a number of teachers who testified that there was constant supervision by teachers at the school and they were not aware of, nor advised of, anything untoward happening.

On February 7, 1985 the bodies of James McLean and Ann McLean were found in the bathroom of their home, a trailer, in Valleyview, Alberta. A police investigation led to Martineau and one Patrick Tremblay. Martineau, who was fifteen at the time, was charged with both murders and was transferred to adult court. Martineau was tried by a judge and jury starting on September 12, 1985. Thirty witnesses gave evidence including the accused. The evidence revealed that Martineau and his friend, Tremblay, had set out one evening armed with a pellet pistol and rifle respectively. Martineau testified that he knew that they were going to commit a crime, but that he thought it would only be a \"b and e\". After robbing the trailer and its occupants, Martineau's friend Tremblay shot and killed the McLeans. As they left the trailer, Martineau asked Tremblay why he killed them and Tremblay answered, \"they saw our faces\". Martineau responded, \"But they couldn't see mine 'cause I had a mask on\". They drove James McLean's car to Grande Prairie where they abandoned it. The respondent was convicted of second degree murder. The trial judge charged the jury ons. 213(a) and (d) of theCriminal Codeand ons. 21(1)and(2)of theCriminal Code.",

Various phone calls were made to the husband of the victim after she was kidnapped demanding ransom. The victim was then shot and killed by one of the respondent's accomplices. The Crown alleged that the respondent was a party to the kidnapping and shooting of the victim by virtue of ss. 21(2), 212, 213(a) and 213(d) of theCode. A witness at the trial, David Drew, gave evidence to the effect that while bowling the respondent told him of his involvement in the kidnapping. The respondent told Drew that his role was to watch the comings and goings of people at the home of the victim, and to give the times to his accomplice. He described how all three had followed the victim, grabbed her in an alleyway, hauled her into a van, tied her feet and hands and gagged and blindfolded her. The witness Drew also claimed that the respondent told him how they transported the victim to Burnaby Mountain where one of the respondent's accomplices took her out of the vehicle and shot her. The credibility of Drew was severely attacked in cross-examination, especially on the grounds that he had 15 criminal convictions, he was arrested as a suspect in the murder and that the victim's gloves were found in the garbage behind his flat.

The Court of Appeal for Alberta dismissed, without written reasons, an appeal from conviction. The body of the victim was found lying in a farmer's field at about 7:00 a.m. on April 14, 1984. An autopsy revealed that she had 12 stab wounds to her neck and three to her head. She bled to death as a result of a wound to her carotid artery. At trial, evidence was adduced to establish that the appellant hailed a cab outside a gay night-club and asked the victim, the cab driver, to take him to his motel room. When they arrived at the motel, the appellant asked her to wait for him while he picked up his luggage. At that time the appellant also retrieved a knife from his room. The appellant, upon his return, sat in the front passenger's seat. A witness who observed the victim's driving testified that her driving pattern was very erratic following the departure from the motel. After his arrest, the appellant told the R.C.M.P. that he had been drinking and taking drugs before getting into the cab. He remembered being in a field and wanting the cab driver's money. When he took her money, he had the knife displayed. At his request, the victim got out of the cab and his next memory was of his standing on the highway attempting to flag down a truck. In a later statement he remembered that he had initially pulled out the knife on entering the cab at the motel and told the victim to keep driving until he told her to stop. It was further alleged that the appellant made an incriminating statement to another prisoner while in custody awaiting trial to the effect that he had stabbed the victim inside the cab and again outside the cab because she called him a \"faggot\".

It is not first degree murder if you find a robbery without a forcible confinement. It is not first degree murder if you find no planning or deliberation but, once again, as I told you when I charged you, don't concern yourself with that one, because the Crown conceded that this is not a case of planning and deliberation and I concur, but there was some evidence that you might have found that in any event, so, I charged you on it. So, that one I would suggest you should put aside.... It is not first degree murder if you find in fact you have a doubt as to whether the accused did form the intent to forcibly confine....

At around 11:00 p.m. on September 23, 1983, Hugh Logan, Clive Brown and the respondent Warren Johnson entered a convenience store, wearing masks and armed with revolvers. Hugh Logan shot the lone clerk, Barbara Turnbull, in the neck, causing severe injuries. The cash register was robbed and the men fled. While awaiting trial on the charges, the respondents were held in protective custody in a jail in the Toronto area. Shortly before the trial, the police received information from an informer that the respondent Sutcliffe Logan was boasting openly about his involvement in the planning of the robberies, including the one from which the attempted murder charges arose. Two undercover police officers were placed in protective custody with the respondents, posing as two persons arrested on drug charges. The officers struck up an acquaintance with the two respondents who made certain inculpatory statements. The officers testified that they did not encourage the respondents to talk, but merely provided the opportunity for the making of the statements. The officers made notes of the conversation immediately following the conversation during what they pretended was a visit from an articling student from their lawyer's office. These statements were admitted into evidence at trial. Also during the course of the trial, the respondent Warren Johnson took the stand and, while admitting that he was one of the robbers, testified that he had no intention to shoot anyone and that there had been no discussion concerning the use of guns. In his charge to the jury with respect to the respondent Warren Johnson, the trial judge said that \"you may well have considerable doubt whether he knew or should have known that one of his group would probably shoot somebody with the intention to kill\".",

In his explanation of s. 21 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the trial judge instructed the jury that \"[i]t must be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew or ought to have known that someone would probably shoot with the intention of killing\". Hugh Logan was found by the jury to have been the one who shot the victim. The respondents were convicted by the jury of a number offences including the attempted murder of Barbara Turnbull. The respondents appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The Court of Appeal allowed their appeals with respect to the convictions for attempted murder, and substituted convictions for armed robbery in their stead. The only issue before this Court is the constitutionality ofs. 21(2)of theCriminal Code.",

About twenty minutes later, the police located the vehicle and found the appellant sitting in the driver's seat and another person sitting beside him. The investigating officer was not sure whether the vehicle was in motion when he located it. However, he testified that while he got out of the police car and approached the vehicle, he saw the appellant gesturing as if putting it in reverse and, in effect, the vehicle moved back about one foot. The key was in the ignition and the ignition was on. The passenger was found in possession of an additional set of keys in his pocket. The appellant and the passenger were immediately arrested by the police. It is common ground that the accused had been drinking heavily in the hours which preceded his arrest. He testified that he had no recollection of any of the events that took place between midnight and the moment he was awakened in his cell, late that morning. The appellant was acquitted of the four counts of which he was charged: robbery contrary to s. 303 of theCode, theft of the car contrary to s. 294(a) of theCode, possession of the car contrary to s. 312(1)(a) of theCodeand care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 234 of theCode.

    "text": "In neither case are the facts disputed. The facts and procedural history of each case may be summarized as follows: Hess The appellant Victor John Hess was charged in 1985 unders.146(1)of theCriminal Code. He initially entered a plea of guilty, but was permitted to change his plea when other cases raised doubts as to the constitutionality of the section. By way of motion after plea, he raised the unconstitutionality of the section as a defence, admitting for the purposes of the motion that an act of sexual intercourse had taken place and that the complainant was under the age of fourteen years and the appellant was over the age of eighteen years. Graham Prov. Ct. J. allowed the motion, on the grounds thats.146(1)infringeds. 15of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsby providing protection to females but not to males under fourteen years of age. He was of the view that it had not been demonstrated that the infringement was justified under s. 1, and that although biological differences between males and females might once have been grounds for affording greater protection to the latter, it was doubtful that this could be justified in these times. The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, in a judgment rendered February 3, 1988, and ordered a new trial: 25 O.A.C. 43, 40 C.C.C. (3d) 193. Dubin J.A., writing for the Court, first noted that the impugned legislation had been repealed. He then considered whether a contravention of s. 15 had been made out. In his view, the fact that young males under fourteen were not given the same protection as young females under fourteen did not violate s. 15. Under that section, it was necessary to determine \"whether the law was reasonable or fair, having regard to its purpose and effect\". Dubin J.A., noting the grave consequences which result to the victim and society and relying on the British Columbia Court of Appeal's decision inR. v. Ferguson(1987), 16 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273, concluded that it was neither unfair nor irrational for Parliament to have treated sexual intercourse with a female under fourteen as a more serious offence. Nguyen The appellant Van Hung Nguyen was charged with sexual assault and contravention of s. 146(1).",

At the preliminary hearing, the Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the sexual assault charge, but Nguyen was ordered to stand trial on the second charge. He brought a preliminary motion challenging the validity of s. 146(1) on the grounds that it infringeds. 7ands. 15of theCharter. The Court of Queen's Bench dismissed the motion and the trial proceeded. The evidence established that sexual intercourse had taken place, that the complainant was twelve years old at the time, and that the complainant did not indicate her lack of consent to the appellant because she was too scared. Nguyen was convicted and sentenced to fifteen months' incarceration. The Manitoba Court of Appeal dismissed Nguyen's appeal: (1989), 57 Man. R. (2d) 267, [1989] 3 W.W.R. 646.

Having informed the accused and counsel of these communications and having asked for and failed to obtain agreement of counsel as to what steps should be taken, and since in my opinion there was, at that stage of the trial, only one course to follow, I conducted my own inquiry, which is fully documented in the Record of the case, and interviewed each accusing juror in turn exclusively as to the reasons for her suspicions. I satisfied myself that these were without foundation. I therefore permitted the jury's deliberations to continue, rejecting the two alternative courses of (a) removal from the jury of the two jurors against whom the accusations had been made, or (b) declaring a mistrial. I formally advised the accused and counsel of my decision. The two notes sent to the judge by the two jurors read as follows: [TRANSLATION] Your Honour, I have doubts with respect to the honesty of two jurors, may I meet with you? Yours truly, Pauline Charbonneau. Your Honour, We are in a state of panic caused by the behaviour of Daniel and Denis (juror numbers 9 and 4), who do not want to listen to anyone. They are like wild beasts, and I accuse them of doing everything possible to influence in a diabolical manner the weaker jurors; and they are doing this in their own interest, and I believe I know the source of that interest. I will have much more to say at a more appropriate time and place. Yours respectfully, Janette Trudel. The judge, in the presence of the accused and of counsel, read the notes and made the following request: [TRANSLATION] Might I just request the consent of counsel for the defence to my examining-without the presence of counsel and without the presence of the accused-to my meeting at her request with juror No. 5 to hear what she has to say?",

    "text": "While consented to by the Crown, this was clearly objected to by the defence. There ensued a discussion, and, after a recess for lunch, counsel for the defence made a motion for mistrial. This motion was based on the fact that given the nature of the accusation the jury could not enjoy the [Page 8] serenity required to fulfill its duties. Furthermore, there was some concern that if jurors No. 9 and No. 4 knew of the nature of the suspicion entertained by some of the jurors, they would be pressured into giving a verdict that would dispel these suspicions. The defence asked, in the alternative, that the two jurors who sent the notes be excluded from the panel. The motions were denied. Lamb J. met together with these two jurors in his chambers, in the sole presence of a court reporter. It was only once the verdict was pronounced that counsel and the accused were informed in open court of his meeting with the jurors and given a transcript of the exchange that took place in the judge's chambers. The record does not reveal whether the judge's disposition of the motions was made prior to his meeting with the jurors. In fact, as was revealed in the Court of Appeal and referred to by Owen J.A. in his judgment: When asked by counsel for defence whether he had conducted an inquiry with respect to the two jurors who had written notes, the presiding judge replied: [TRANSLATION] I can tell you that I have come to the conclusion that there is no valid reason that the jury cannot, will not, be able to or should not continue its deliberations in order to arrive at their verdict.",

The Crown's case consisted principally of one hundred thirty-six intercepted communications. At trial, avoir direwas held to determine the admissibility of the interceptions. At its conclusion, the trial judge held all but nine inadmissible. The Crown called no evidence before the jury and the trial judge directed the jury to acquit the appellants. The Crown's appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered: (1986), 33 D.L.R. (4th) 744, [1986] 5 W.W.R. 131, 29 C.C.C. (3d) 516, 53 C.R. (3d) 56. This appeal is made as of right under s. 618(2) of theCriminal Code. The case involved an intensive police investigation which was carried out in widely separated areas of the province of British Columbia, and resulted on September 11, 1983 in a seizure of 278 lbs. of marijuana in a vehicle driven by the appellant, McDonald, in which Rosen was a passenger. The police were aware from the outset that those under investigation resorted to and made wide use of pay telephones as a means of communication, and that in doing so they used a code to advise each other of the locations at which they could be reached. During the investigation, the police installed and operated interception devices upon several pay telephones, private residential premises and hotel rooms occupied by the appellants or some of them. Three authorizations were procured by the authorities during the investigation. The authorizations are identical except for the dates, the agent applying for the authorization, the names of the affiants, and the identities of the persons whose private communications may be intercepted (targets) in paragraph (c) in each authorization.

This resulted in interception of conversations of persons not covered by the authorizations. This is apparently contrary to R.C.M.P. policy with respect to monitoring pay telephones. On such occasions the procedure was to rewind the tape, and play enough of the intercepted conversation to determine if a \"target\" was speaking. Only if a target was speaking would the whole conversation be listened to and noted. Otherwise, the conversation would be played forward at a fast speed and a low volume so that it was unintelligible. If, however, no targets were speaking but early in the conversation it became apparent that the conversation related to other criminal activity, the entire conversation would be listened to.",

The principal evidence consisted of: (a) intercepted private communications, many of which were between Garofoli in Hamilton and Frank Savasta in Florida; (b) the evidence of Earl Smith, who was employed by Savasta to transport three kilograms of cocaine from Florida to Hamilton in November 1983; (c) the evidence of Biebuyck, as to the purchase by Vanderkooy of a quantity of cocaine in November or December 1983, and the subsequent sale and the delivery of certain of the proceeds to Scibetta; and (d) evidence confirming the presence of Smith in Hamilton in November 1983 and Savasta in Hamilton in January 1984. The Court of Appeal held that the jury would be warranted in finding the following facts. Garofoli in Hamilton arranged with Savasta in Florida to purchase three kilograms of cocaine. On November 20, 1983, Criminisi and Allen flew to Florida and paid Savasta $20,000 of a total price of $61,000 for three kilograms of cocaine. Criminisi rented a car, and the cocaine was placed in its spare tire. Smith and Allen drove the car to Buffalo where Smith was to collect the balance of the purchase price. Smith and Allen registered at a hotel in Buffalo, and were joined by Scibetta. It was decided that Smith would drive the car across the border. After crossing the border, Smith and Allen drove to a hotel in Hamilton where they registered as guests early in the morning of November 23. Later that morning, Criminisi and Scibetta joined them at the hotel. Scibetta removed the spare tire from the rental car's trunk, put it in his car, and drove away. Smith, Criminisi and Allen went to the M & R Auto Body Shop, and met Garofoli and others. The car was stored there, with the Florida licence plates removed. Smith remained in Hamilton, attempting to collect the balance of the purchase price. Around November 27 Criminisi paid him a further $10,000. A few days later, Smith, Criminisi and Allen went to Garofoli's home to discuss the balance. They telephoned Savasta at his office in Florida from a nearby pay telephone. Criminisi spoke first to Savasta. Then Garofoli spoke to Savasta, telling him he could be trusted to pay the balance.",

Then Garofoli spoke to Savasta, telling him he could be trusted to pay the balance. While speaking to Savasta, he gave $4,790 to Criminisi which he gave to Smith. Then Smith spoke to Savasta who told him to return to Florida. In late November or in early December 1983, Vanderkooy and Biebuyck drove to the M & R Body Shop. Vanderkooy went in, returned with Scibetta, and pointed to his car. Vanderkooy and Biebuyck left, and returned about one half-hour later. Vanderkooy again went into the shop. He returned and drove to Biebuyck's home, where he removed a package containing a kilogram of cocaine from the trunk of his car. The cocaine was divided into one-ounce packages. Most of it was sold, with certain of the proceeds being turned over to Scibetta. After Smith returned to Florida, there were several telephone calls from Savasta to Garofoli concerning payment of the money. In January 1984 Savasta came to Hamilton where he met with Garofoli. During the investigation, there were four orders authorizing the interception of the private communications. They were granted September 26, September 29, November 21 and December 30, 1983, by judges of the High Court of Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario. The evidence of Garofoli's involvement in the conspiracy is derived in large measure from private communications intercepted under these authorizations. These included telephone conversations which ostensibly referred to the importing of various automobiles and jewelry, but which the jury were invited to interpret as referring to cocaine. At the conclusion of avoir direto determine the admissibility of the intercepted communications, the trial judge refused to order the opening of the sealed packets containing the affidavits upon which the orders were obtained and ordered that the wiretap evidence was admissible. The appellant did not appear for the next day of the trial. The trial was adjourned while inquiries were made as to his whereabouts. When it appeared that there was no explanation for his absence, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.

    "text": "Aggravated Assault The appellant and his brother, David Lachance, were convicted by Ferguson Dist. Ct. J., sitting alone, of aggravated assault of Derrick Hollett. The appellant had become acquainted with Hollett at the Don Jail in Toronto. In January 1985, the Lachance brothers were involved in trafficking speed with Hollett. Hollett's debts to them are variously reported as $500 to $4,000. Wiretap evidence showed that both the appellant and his brother were looking for Hollett to collect the money. Hollett, however, successfully avoided them despite his promises to pay. In one particular instance, he made the excuse that he had been arrested for breaking and entering. He arranged to meet with the Lachance brothers at a donut shop to show them the bail papers, but did not show up. On March 27, 1985 Hollett was visiting a friend's apartment. The Lachance brothers arrived at about 7:00 p.m. Hollett went to the bathroom. The trial judge found as fact that Hollett emerged from the bathroom concealing a knife in his right hand. He confronted the appellant, who saw the concealed knife. The appellant punched Hollett in the face, which the trial judge found to be reasonable force used in self-defence. The trial judge found that Daniel Lachance did not see the concealed knife, and that Hollett's threatening behaviour was not directed towards Daniel Lachance. Daniel Lachance moved behind Hollett, held his knife to Hollett's throat, and wounded Hollett. The appellant took Hollett's knife. With it, he cut Hollett's face, slit his stomach area, and stabbed him in the stomach and chest. The wiretap evidence was an important factor in the factual findings. It confirmed elements of Hollett's testimony. Hollett might not otherwise have made a very credible witness due to, among other things, his long criminal record. The trial judge referred in particular to two interceptions made March 28, the day following the stabbing. He said: The intercepted communications which were admitted in evidence leave in my mind no doubt whatsoever that both of the accused were intent on confronting Hollett and that they were entirely satisfied with the manner in which Hollett had been dealt with physically. The words used by them in the intercepted communications are consistent only with the conclusion that they boasted of their physical accomplishment.",

    "text": "The words used by them in the intercepted communications are consistent only with the conclusion that they boasted of their physical accomplishment. Wiretaps The relevant authorizations for wiretaps were obtained with respect to the robbery of a precious metal dealer, Intercontinental Gold, in December, 1984. Authorizations were obtained on January 31, February 8, and February 27, 1985. Each was obtained on the basis of an affidavit sworn by Sergeant John Lamont. The intercepted communications tendered as evidence were all obtained under the February 27 authorization. The January 31 affidavit names 5 individuals as targets, who the police believed committed the robbery on the basis of information from an informant and other investigation. The February 8 affidavit is substantially the same, but corrects the addresses given for two of the targets. The February 27 affidavit repeats the contents of the prior affidavits. It then adds new facts, set out in para. 1(i). (i) That subsequently Sergeant Paul Landry, a member of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force attached to the Hold-Up Squad, has informed and I verily believe: (i) That on the 9th day of February, 1985, he had conversation with an informant, who has not been previously mentioned in this my Affidavit. (ii) That this informant told him that Art Szostak and a male he knew only as Ted set up the robbery of Intercontinental Gold previously mentioned in this my Affidavit. (iii) That the informant told him that the jewellery stolen from Intercontinental Gold was given to a male party he knew only as \"The Jew\" to sell. (iv) That the informant told him that Art Szostak and \"Ted\" have recruited at least three other men to do another robbery for them in the near future. (At present, it is not known if there are other participants in this planned robbery.) (v) That the informant told him that these three men were Daniel LaChance, his brother David LaChance and Derrick Hollett. (vi) That the informant told him that as a result of having been previously investigated by the police for Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, the three men were aware they were known to the police and would take measures to avoid police surveillance.",

    "text": "In paragraph 1(j) Sergeant Lamont deposes that based on his own observations and investigations, he verily believes that the information obtained by Sergeant Landry from the informant is correct. Later, in para. 10 of the affidavit, Sergeant Lamont repeats his belief that the targets are uncooperative and surveillance-conscious. He deposes that the targets form a close-knit group of friends and relatives, so that any attempt to involve an undercover police officer would be futile. He deposes that the only remaining investigative step would be to question the targets, which would be highly unlikely to assist the investigation. He therefore concludes that the only practical investigative technique would be to intercept the private communications of the targets. In Hollett's testimony at trial, it is apparent that he is the informant referred to in Sergeant Lamont's affidavit. He testified in chief that he was arrested for cocaine possession in January or February 1985. He testified in cross-examination that he lied when he told David and Daniel Lachance that he was arrested for breaking and entering, but that he lied in order to cover up his involvement with the Hold-Up Squad. In re-examination he testified that sometime in February 1985 he began working for the Hold-Up Squad as an informant. He told them of the involvement of the Lachance brothers in the Intercontinental Gold robbery. He was asked by the Hold-Up Squad to \"get back in\" with the Lachance brothers, which he attempted to do. He was aware that when he telephoned the Lachance brothers, the telephones were wiretapped. The Hold-Up Squad asked him to arrange a meeting with the Lachance brothers, and to wear a body pak for the meeting. Hollett agreed to do this, although he was skeptical about the idea. Sergeant Lamont's testimony onvoir direalso supports the inference that Hollett was the informant referred to in the affidavit. He testified in chief that part of the information implicating the Lachance brothers in the robbery was obtained from the informant, Hollett. In cross-examination he testified that he first met Hollett in late February 1985, although his partner had had earlier contact with him. On cross-examination he was asked why Hollett was named on the authorization. He testified that the police had believed other offences were about to take place, although Hollett was not a suspect in relation to the offences listed in the authorization.",

They were given notice, in accordance with the statutory requirement, that evidence against them included wiretap evidence obtained under twenty-two authorizations under Part IV.1 of theCriminal Code. The appellants applied to the Vancouver County Court for an order pursuant to s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii) to have access to the contents of the sealed packets containing the affidavit filed in support of the wiretap authorizations. The application for access was in each case supported by an affidavit stating that access to the statements by the police officers was necessary to properly conduct a preliminary hearing and in order for the accused to make full answer and defence. Wetmore Co. Ct. J. granted access in an oral judgment, following the cases ofWilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594 (presumably the minority judgment), andR. v. Finlay and Grellette(1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 48 (Ont. C.A.).

    "text": "During the summer of 1984 the Toronto Police commenced an investigation aimed at determining the location of \"floating\" gaming houses frequented by gamblers of Oriental extraction. As part of this investigation, police officers attended at various downtown hotels and asked the security officers in those establishments to inform them of \"anything unusual as to Orientals attending hotels\". Some time after this request, in September of the same year, the security staff at a major downtown hotel contacted the police with information relating to the possible use of their premises for illegal gaming. On September 17, the officers in charge of the gambling investigation went to the hotel and attended at a recently vacated room. There the officers found that the occupants of the room had rearranged the furniture in order to form a long table suitable for gambling. In addition, on searching the garbage the occupants had left behind, the police found many slips of paper bearing Chinese characters. The slips bore the address and number of the hotel room, and the chief investigating officer was able to identify these notices as similar to some which he knew were distributed to potential Oriental gamblers in various restaurants in Toronto's Chinatown area. The police checked the hotel register and discovered that the appellant, Santiago Wong, had booked this room for the 19th and 20th of the same month. On the basis of their findings of the 17th, the police concluded that the room booked by the appellant might be used for illegal gambling. After determining that it would not be feasible to see into the room from the roof of the other wing of the hotel, the officers in charge of the investigation concluded that only video surveillance would enable them to further their investigation by actually monitoring what transpired in the room booked by the appellant. Notably, the police rejected the idea of employing undercover officers. On the basis of past experience, they were certain that the gaming would be conducted behind locked doors, by and for Orientals alone. Since the identity of Oriental police officers was well known in the community, the investigating officers concluded it would be virtually impossible to infiltrate the gambling sessions with undercover operators.",

Once it was determined that video surveillance was the only feasible way of monitoring what went on in the room, the officers contacted the Metro Police Intelligence Branch and a Crown Counsel to discuss the possibility of obtaining a warrant. These discussions left the police officers with the impression that it would not be possible to obtain judicial authorization to conduct the video surveillance. The investigators therefore decided to proceed without this authorization, and on September 19 the police installed a video camera in the drapery valence of the room that was registered to Mr. Wong. The camera had a lens about the size of the lead of a pencil and was attached to simultaneous recording equipment which the police monitored from an adjacent hotel room. The police installed this equipment with the permission and co‐operation of the hotel management. The police monitored the activities in the rooms on five separate occasions. These observations left no doubt that illegal gambling sessions were being held in the hotel suite. This surveillance culminated in a raid in the early morning hours of October 1, 1984. The police entered the room with a key provided by management and found a large group of Oriental males in the suite. A search of these persons revealed numerous slips of the type seized in the initial search of September 17. The appellant was found to be in possession of profit lists, while debt lists were seized from some of the other occupants of the room. The police were also able to seize gambling paraphernalia and a large amount of money found lying on the gaming table. The appellant and ten other accused were later charged with the offence of keeping a common gaming house. At trial, all the accused pleaded not guilty. On September 11, 1985, the trial judge dismissed the charges against all those concerned. He held the video surveillance of the accused to be a violation ofs. 8of theCharter, and excluded the evidence thereby obtained unders. 24(2)of theCharter.",

OnJanuary 12, 1981, Father Mercure appeared in a proceeding before theProvincial CourtforSaskatchewanpresided over by His Honour Judge L. Deshaye. Before entering a plea, the appellant, whose native tongue was French, requested the trial judge to conduct the entire proceedings in French. He also requested to have the hearing delayed until the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan could provide him with five pertinent provincial statutes printed in French. On April 15, 1981, Judge Deshaye rendered a decision denying the application: (1981), 44Sask.R. 43, [1981] 4 W.W.R. 435. Judge Deshaye held that the appellant did have the right to use the French language before theProvincial Court, but was not entitled to be provided with the relevant statutes printed in French. The right to the use of the French language before the court was restricted to the provision of an interpreter. The matter was then adjourned toApril 24, 1981, at which time Father Mercure, when asked to enter a plea, indicated that he wished to stand mute. The judge entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was conducted entirely in English. The appellant did not testify at trial. The appellant was found guilty of the charge. No interpreter was present at the trial as the appellant took the position that having an interpreter translate the proceedings was not sufficient recognition of his right to use the French language before the court, and, in any event, he argued that he could not defend himself without access to the statutes printed in French. Father Mercure appealed by way of stated case to the Court of Appeal forSaskatchewan. On October 28, 1985, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal: (1985), 44Sask.R. 22, 24 D.L.R.

The police go to a location where they believe there has been a high incidence of impaired driving or alcohol related accidents. Motorists passing through this location are requested, on a random basis, to pull over and stop. Police officers ask the driver for a valid driver's licence and proof of insurance and they note the condition of the vehicle and the driver. The demand for a licence and proof of insurance is made for the purpose of initiating conversation with the ultimate goal of allowing the police to detect the drinking driver whom they might otherwise be unable to detect.

The police did not have reasonable and probable grounds for believing he had committed or was committing a criminal offence under any statute, either provincial or federal. The officer did not, at the time of the stop, have any reasonable suspicion that the appellant had alcohol in his body. 4.The appellant complied with the request to stop his vehicle.

    "text": "The Court of Appeal found there was no abuse of process orCharterviolation in theCrown's staying of proceedings before the first judge after the adverse ruling, and then recommencing them before a new judge. It stated thatCrowncounsel was not simply circumventing an unfavourable ruling, but was protecting an important public interest. Observing that the use of a stay must remain subject to judicial review, it concluded that \"having regard to the public interests with which theCrownwas concerned, there was compelling reason to stay the proceedings\". In essence, the Court of Appeal is saying that the use of a stay to circumvent an adverse ruling is legitimate because theCrownhad a good reason founded in public interest for following the course it did. I question whether such reasoning is sufficient to avoid the inference of abuse of process. As this Court stated inKeyowski,supra, theCrown's good faith and motive are only two of the factors to be considered in determining whether an abuse of process is made out. The same has repeatedly been held with respect toCharterbreaches; under theCharterlack of good faith and motive are irrelevant on the question of whether the accused's rights have been breached, although they may be considered unders. 24(2)in determining the use to which evidence obtained as a result of a breach may be put. It would appear at least necessary to take the further step of examining the magnitude of the affront to justice and fairness against the public interest in prosecution. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal, moreover, fails to fully address the real concerns raised by theCrown's conduct -- concerns relating to judge-shopping, the impartiality of the administration of justice and the integrity and dignity of the judicial process. I have the same concerns with regard to the reasons of my colleague, Cory J. He, too, emphasizes that theCrownacted in good faith and that its actions were not abusive, in the sense that they were aimed at protecting the identity of a police informer. This, while relevant, is insufficient in itself to justify an abuse of process. Cory J. makes two further points. TheCrown, he says, had no alternative but to stay the trial in order to fulfil its duty. I cannot agree.",

TheCrown, he says, had no alternative but to stay the trial in order to fulfil its duty. I cannot agree. TheCrown, faced with the evidentiary ruling which might have led to disclosure of the informer's identity, could have stood the witness down and declined to call further evidence. The result would probably have been an acquittal. TheCrownthen could have appealed the acquittal on the ground of the judge's erroneous ruling in the usual way, asking for a new trial. This is what happened inR. v. Banas and Haverkamp(1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 164. There the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from an acquittal made after theCrowndeclined to lead evidence following an adverse ruling. Martin J.A. stated at p. 169: We do not think that theCrown, in the circumstances, is precluded from appealing the directed verdict becauseCrowncounsel decided not to continue with the trial which he considered would be fruitless and which would not result in a conviction due to the erroneous exclusion of vital evidence. We are satisfied that if the trial judge had not excluded the evidence of the intercepted private communications the verdict of the jury would not necessarily have been the same. If the Crown had followed this course in the case at bar the concerns to which I have alluded would have been avoided. TheCrowncould not be accused of judge-shopping, since the new trial would be the result of a court decision rather than aCrowndecision. Concerns for the impartiality of the administration of justice would not arise, since the critical decision would be made by the Court of Appeal where the accused may be fully heard. And the integrity and dignity of the judicial process would be preserved, in that the adverse ruling would not be circumvented by the act of theCrown, but would be properly set aside by an appellate court. Finally, Cory J. alludes to the fact that the accused was not prejudiced by way of delay since he was at all times in custody on another matter.",

Generally speaking (and leaving to one side the question of trial delay unders. 11(b)of theCharterwhere differing views have been expressed) it is not incumbent upon an accused to demonstrate actual prejudice as a condition of being able to rely on hisCharterrights. Nor does prejudice figure prominently in the jurisprudence on abuse of process. Finding myself unconvinced by the reasons enunciated in the court below or by Cory J. for the proposition that abuse of process or breach of theCharterhas not been made out, I find it necessary to embark on my own analysis. Guidance as to the content of \"oppressive\", \"vexatious\" and \"contrary to the fundamental principles of justice\", the basic test for abuse of process, may be had from the cases which have considered that doctrine. Those cases invoke concerns for the fairness of the process from the vantage point of the accused as well as the public interest in proper functioning of the judicial system. The specific concerns raised in this case involve the spectre of judge-shopping, concern for impartiality of the judicial process, and concern for the maintenance of the integrity and dignity of the judicial system and the judges within it. These concerns must be balanced against the public interest in prosecuting crimes to ascertain whether they outweigh that interest with the result that allowing the proceedings to stand would tarnish the image of the court. Each of the concerns I have raised may be seen to involve a fundamental principle of justice underlying our community's sense of fair play and justice. A system that allows the Crown an advantage in choosing or changing judges, a system which either in fact or appearance is partial, a system which permits a judge's ruling to be circumvented other than by the normal appeal process -- such a system would be open to the charge that it offended the fundamental principles of justice upon which our society rests. By the same token, proceedings which permit such abuses might be characterized as \"vexatious\" or \"unfair\". The question is whether the apparent concerns are of such gravity that they may be said to outweigh the public interest.",

The question is whether the apparent concerns are of such gravity that they may be said to outweigh the public interest. In my view the answer is yes. The public has an interest in prosecuting crimes as well as in protecting the identity of informers. But, as I have already suggested, both these interests could have been met by adopting the alternative of calling no further evidence and appealing the resulting acquittal. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the public interest justifies or offsets the affront to justice and fairness involved in the course theCrownchose to follow. The situation, moreover, falls within the rubric of \"the clearest of cases\". The deviation from the fundamental principles of justice is clear and, being unnecessary, incapable of justification.

I conclude that theCrown's conduct in staying the proceedings to avoid an adverse judicial ruling and then recommencing them establishes the case for abuse of process.

    "text": "3.Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal related and analysed the facts in great detail in their judgments. I do not think it is necessary for me to do so in this judgment. I need only say the following. Rousseau is a lawyer. Three of his clients were involved in theft and receiving. Two of them worked for the security company which had the contract to protect the businesses where the thefts occurred. 4.The attempted obstruction of justice and conspiracy for that purpose arose from the fact that Rousseau allegedly agreed with the police officer responsible for the investigation of these crimes, a man named Asselin, to lay charges only for a part of them and to conceal the identities of the perpetrators from the authorities as to the remainder, in return for money obtained from his clients, money which Rousseau claimed was to be shared with the police officer. 5.The extortion was allegedly committed by a request made by the lawyer Rousseau to the lawyer of the security company for the sum of $10,000 to avoid publicity which, in connection with events involving employees, would have been bad for the company. The lawyer Rousseau allegedly said that he would be able to have the charges quietly dropped. The evidence of this request for money rested simply on the testimony of the company's lawyer. 6.The evidence relating to the other two counts is more complicated. Essentially, it consisted of conversations which Rousseau had with his clients, related at the trial by two of them, a discussion between Rousseau and the police officer, and finally statements made by the police officer to Rousseau's clients. 7.The trial judge disposed of the second and third counts quite briefly, saying simply that [TRANSLATION] \"The evidence does not support a guilty verdict on counts 2 and 3.\" However, he undertook a meticulous and exhaustive analysis of the evidence on the charge of conspiracy. The following passage summarizes his analysis: [TRANSLATION] The evidence did not establish any agreement between Rousseau and Asselin in the presence of any other person.",

The appellant was subsequently convicted of first degree murder by a jury in the High Court of Justice of Ontario. Much of the evidence at trial came from an agreed statement of facts. It was admitted by the appellant that he had made arrangements, several days before the incident, to return to his native country, India, along with his two children. To this end, he purchased three airline tickets and collected them on May 2, 1986. He also purchased a number of other items during this period, including an axe and a suitcase. The appellant admitted that he and his wife argued over a number of matters several days before the incident, to the extent that his wife left their home in order to stay with relatives for a short time, returning only on the afternoon of May 2, 1986. The argument that caused her to leave was precipitated in part by the appellant's decision to quit his job. The spouses had also disagreed on numerous occasions as to whether the family should return to India. Immediately after killing his wife, the appellant tried but failed to enlist the help of friends in order to remove her body from the home. He finally severed the body into smaller parts with an axe and disposed of them in a nearby river. He cleaned the premises and later made attempts to enter the United States. The sole defence raised by the appellant at trial was the insanity defence unders. 16of theCriminal Code. Expert psychiatric evidence was given at trial that the appellant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia at the time that the act was committed. The mental disorder caused the appellant to become deluded that he was a prophet who had been called upon by God to lead the world in forming an international government; the disorder also caused him to hear voices telling him that he and his family were cursed and that they must return to India.",

The respondent was arrested the following day and questioned by police with respect to the incident. He had been charged and convicted, approximately three years earlier, of assaulting the victim. The respondent refused to speak to any police officers and was released several days later. Almost four months later, in response to renewed questioning by the police, the respondent confessed to having caused the death of Mr. Fortin. He admitted that he had planned the event: he had acquired a firearm for this purpose some time earlier and had entered the home of the victim on the day in question with the weapon concealed on his person. After firing two shots at the victim's head, he left the premises, threw the firearm in a river and returned to his own home. The respondent was convicted of first degree murder by a jury in the Superior Court of Quebec. The respondent conceded that he had committed the physical act of killing Mr. Fortin, but argued that he should be found not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant tos. 16of theCriminal Code. Uncontradicted evidence was given at trial that the respondent suffered from a severe psychosis that made him believe that he was God and had a mission to destroy all forces of evil on Earth. He suffered from the further delusion that Mr. Fortin was \"Satan\" and that he had to kill him in order to rid the Earth effectively of all evil forces. The respondent knew that murder was a crime and that he would in all likelihood be arrested for this act, but he believed nevertheless that the act was necessary in order to fulfill his Divine mission. The trial judge instructed the jury to consider the insanity defence, stating that the respondent should not be convicted if he lacked the capacity, because of disease of the mind, to appreciate the nature or quality of his act or to know that the act was legally wrong. The Court of Appeal of Quebec unanimously set aside the respondent's conviction and substituted a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity: (1988), 48 C.C.C.

There have been two trials on the indictment. The evidence called by the Crown in both trials was virtually the same. In neither case was evidence called by the defence. The principal Crown witness was Sgt. Myny, a police officer from Michigan. Phase I Sgt. Myny's testimony revealed that he arrested one \"Sue Ellen\" on a cocaine trafficking charge in December of 1983. In exchange for a promise of lenient treatment, Sue Ellen agreed to introduce Myny to other cocaine dealers. Pursuant to her undertaking, she arranged to have Sgt. Myny meet a person named Brent Harding at a restaurant in Windsor, Ontario, on December 14, 1983. Harding was then residing in Kitchener. According to Sue Ellen, he imported cocaine from Venezuela and Colombia. Sue Ellen had acted as a \"mule\" and carried the cocaine into Michigan to Harding who would then smuggle it into Canada. During the meeting of December 14, Sgt. Myny, Harding and Sue Ellen discussed the possibility of Harding's arranging for Myny to purchase cocaine. Two suppliers were discussed, one Florida supplier named Williams and a \"West Palm Beach\" supplier. It was agreed that Harding would purchase one kilo from the West Palm Beach supplier for $40,000 and then charge Myny $5,000 for acting as the go-between. At the same meeting, Harding advised that he had a partner who was later identified as Douglas Reidt. The appellants Douglas and Douris were not mentioned during this meeting, they were not involved in this initial agreement and they were not connected in any way with the Florida suppliers.",

It was agreed that the cocaine would be delivered in Michigan and paid for in American dollars. Two days later, on December 16, Harding informed Myny that the deal would now cost $50,000, that Harding's partner, Reidt, would make the arrangements and that it would take a couple of days to obtain the cocaine. The arrangement was that Harding would contact Reidt who would in turn go to the source. Harding and Myny arranged to meet with Reidt in London, Ontario, on December 20. On that day, Harding arrived without Reidt and refused to complete the transaction. He gave as an excuse that he did not know Myny well enough and suspected that he might be a police officer. On December 22, Sue Ellen advised Myny that Harding was ready to complete the deal. She said that they had been testing him at the December 20 meeting. Further negotiations led to the final agreement that Myny would purchase two kilos of cocaine for $100,000 U.S. A meeting was arranged for January 6 in Port Huron, Michigan, to finalize the details. The transaction itself was to be completed on January 8. It was agreed that Myny would show his money to Harding and Reidt at the meeting, who would then telephone the Florida supplier. The supplier, in turn, would then travel to Michigan and deliver the drugs to Myny. The proposed January 6 meeting was delayed because Harding was having problems getting in touch with the supplier. On January 9, Harding informed Myny that the supplier had refused to make delivery in Michigan. Myny stated that he was unwilling to go down to West Palm Beach to take the delivery. As a result, the deal was frustrated and came to an end on January 9, 1984. Phase II Harding phoned Myny again on January 12, 1984. This time he informed Myny that he had a \"new player\". Arrangements were made to meet in Sarnia on January 14. On that date, Harding introduced Myny to the two appellants in a Sarnia tavern.

As was the situation in Phase I, Reidt was not the supplier, but he was Harding's assistant in contacting the appellants and appears to have been very much involved in the organization of the deal. At the January 14 meeting, the appellant Douris told Myny that the transaction would take place within four days of Myny's advising him that he was ready to take delivery. Once again, the sale was to be for two kilos of cocaine at $50,000 each. Myny made certain that the appellants would take care of Harding's share out of the proceeds of the sale. Douris indicated the following procedure for taking delivery: Douris and Myny would meet in a Michigan hotel to complete the delivery of the cocaine and payment for it. Each would have the assistance of a courier. Douglas told Myny that Harding's previous deal fell through because he was dealing with amateurs. He told Harding that he had done his part and that the appellants would now deal with Myny. The next day, January 15, Myny accepted the offer put forward by Douglas and Douris. On that same day, the telephone surveillance evidence and the wiretap evidence confirmed that Harding was meeting the appellants in Kitchener at the time that Myny confirmed his purchase of the cocaine. The events of the next few days revealed that the deal was not going as planned. Harding informed Myny that the appellants wanted him to take delivery in Canada. On January 31, Harding said that Douris had told him that the drugs would be ready in three days. Myny requested another meeting to discuss the changes to the deal, but this meeting never took place and, as Myny expressed it, the deal died around February 4, 1984. Phase III Two and a half months later, Harding re-established contact with Myny and arranged to meet him on April 30. At this meeting, Myny dealt with both Harding and Reidt and an agreement was reached whereby they were to deliver three kilos of cocaine to Myny in Michigan.",

The parties do not dispute the facts surrounding the sale, which are as follows. The undercover officer was involved in a \"buy-and-bust\" operation conducted by the Vancouver Police Department. In a buy-and-bust operation, undercover police officers attempt to buy illicit drugs from individuals who appear, in the opinion of the officers, to be inclined to sell such drugs. If an officer is successful, the individual is immediately arrested for trafficking. This particular operation was undertaken by the Department with respect to the Granville Mall area in the city of Vancouver, which covers a six-block section of Granville Street. On the day of the arrest, the undercover officer approached the accused, Philip Barnes, and his friend, as they were walking towards Granville Street. The officer testified at trial that she approached the accused and his friend because she had \"a hunch, a feeling that they'd -- possibly might be in possession\". She believed that he and his friend fit the description of persons who possibly had drugs in their possession and who would be willing to sell to her: \"I had a feeling. They fit my general criteria. I look for males hanging around, dressed scruffy and in jeans, wearing a jean jacket or leather jacket, runners or black boots, that tend to look at people a lot.\" The officer indicated that there was nothing else that aroused her suspicions. The officer approached the accused and asked him if he had any \"weed\". He said \"no\", but his friend repeated to him: \"She wants some weed.\" The accused again responded negatively. The officer persisted and the accused then agreed to sell a small amount of cannabis resin to the officer for $15. Shortly afterwards, the accused was arrested by another officer and small amounts of cannabis resin and marijuana were seized from his person. The accused was tried in the County Court of Vancouver before Leggatt Co. Ct. J., and was found guilty of trafficking in cannabis resin, of the included offence of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and of possession of marijuana. The accused conceded that he sold illicit drugs to the officer, but argued that a judicial stay for entrapment should be directed.",

    "text": "On June 13, 1988, Norman Smith, a fisherman, killed his friend, Larry Goreham, with a shotgun. Smith and Goreham had been drinking with two other men, Earl Hopkins and Ronald Hines, in Goreham's barn. After several hours of drinking an argument erupted between Smith and Hopkins, apparently over their respective abilities as fishermen. The fight became physical. While there is some dispute about exactly what happened, there is no doubt that Smith was beaten quite badly as a result of the altercation. According to Hines, he left the barn pointing his finger at the other men and saying: \"I'll get you all.\" Smith denies this. Smith returned ten to fifteen minutes later with his loaded 12-gauge shotgun. Upon hearing Smith's vehicle, Hopkins looked out the window to see Smith holding the gun. Smith fired, shattering a barn window. Hopkins ducked out of the way. Goreham was less wise; appearing at the upper doors of the barn, he began taunting Smith. Smith fired. The shot struck Goreham on the face and chest, and he fell back and died. Investigation established that the gun was fired at a distance of about 96 feet and that there were 169 pellet holes in Goreham's body. Smith got in his vehicle and went home. Substituting a rifle and ammunition for his shotgun, he proceeded to his sister's residence, where he spent the night. Early the next morning he telephoned the police, and at 6:00 a.m. the police came to arrest him. When Smith walked out of the house to surrender, he was met by three officers covering him with rifles; he was directed to his knees, handcuffed and placed in the rear of a police vehicle. In the police vehicle, Constable Terry Faye advised Smith that he was under arrest \"for a shooting incident at the residence of Larry Goreham\". Constable Faye then instructed Smith that \"[you have] the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay\". The officer asked Smith if he understood what that meant and he replied: \"It means I can get a lawyer doesn't it?\" The officer answered: \"Yes, it does\". Constable Faye then provided Smith with the standard police warning and asked him if he understood the warning. Smith replied: \"I can tell you fellas what went on or I don't have to\".",

The officer then advised Smith to say nothing until they reached the police station. Smith arrived at the R.C.M.P. detachment in Barrington, Shelburne County, Nova Scotia, at 6:25 a.m. Once inside an interview room, Constable Faye stated: \"I just want to refresh your memory back there in the car about what I told you. First of all, I told you you were under arrest and that you could contact a lawyer. Lastly, I read you the police warning and you said that you understood that. Norman, do you want the opportunity to exercise those rights about anything I have said to you so far?\" Smith responded: \"No\". The officer then said to Smith, \"O.K. Norman I'd like to get your side of the story. We've heard the other side and I think it's only fair that we get your side.\" Between 6:33 a.m. and 7:47 a.m. the police then took a statement from Smith, in which Smith admitted the shooting but sought to explain it on the grounds of drunkenness and provocation. While the statement was being taken, Constable Faye was able to detect a very slight odour of alcohol on Smith's breath. He also observed that Smith's left eye was almost completely swollen shut and that there was some bruising on his face. During the interview, Constable Faye also became aware that Smith did not know that Mr. Goreham had died. The police had only told Smith that he was being arrested for \"a shooting incident\". Although the police knew that they were investigating a murder, at no time during the interrogation did they inform Smith of this fact. Smith was not informed of Goreham's death until some time after 8:37 a.m., after Smith had finished his statement and had been fingerprinted, photographed and placed in a cell. At that time, Constable Faye also told Smith that he would be discussing the matter with the Crown prosecutor but that Smith should \"think the worst\". Smith was charged with first degree murder. At trial, after avoir direat which the appellant testified, the appellant's statement was held to be admissible in evidence.",

Mr. Szabo appealed his conviction to the Quebec Superior Court; this appeal was dismissed by Mayrand J. on November 21, 1986. Mr. Szabo alleges that on December 17, 1986, he spoke to the clerk of the Quebec Court of Appeal and was told that he could appeal his conviction to the Quebec Court of Appeal as of right. The clerk in question denies (by way of affidavit) having given such advice to the appellant. Subsequently, Mr. Szabo inscribed his appeal without seeking leave of the Court of Appeal. The Crown contacted Mr. Szabo by telephone in December of 1987 and informed him that he required leave to appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, but the appellant did not believe this and refused to follow the Crown's advice. Consequently, on March 23, 1988, the Crown moved to have the appeal dismissed, pursuant to s. 771(1) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and s. 27 of theRules of Practice in Criminal Matters in the Court of Appeal of Quebec, SI/83-107, on the basis that leave had not been granted or requested and that the time period for requesting leave had long since expired.

    "text": "The complainant, T. W., is the niece of the accused. He was 42, she 16. She testified that on two occasions the accused had intercourse with her without her consent. The incidents are alleged to have happened in the course of a three-day period while the complainant was staying temporarily at the accused's home. The complaint was lodged the day after the second incident, and the accused was arrested that night. She testified that on both occasions he was driving her over to her boyfriend's house. He stopped the car in a remote area, demanded intercourse, she submitted out of fear, and on completion he drove her to her destination. What corroborative evidence there was of her story is weak. Her panties were found to have semen stains emitted by a Type A secretor. Thirty-two per cent of the population is such a secretor. The accused is one. However, the complainant spent two nights in the same clothing with her boyfriend. There is no evidence of his \"type\" or whether sexual activity took place with him. Furthermore, her testimony was that the accused ejaculated into a Kleenex on both occasions. The accused testified in his own defence that the alleged incidents never happened. He testified that he simply drove her from his house to her destination without incident. There is no independent evidence corroborative of his version. There is a valid basis of attack with respect to the credibility of both witnesses. The complainant is sixteen years old, an unemployed dropout, and after leaving her parents' home has since been thrown out of several friends' homes. As the defence made clear, she did not complain of these incidents immediately after they occurred despite numerous opportunities to do so, and indeed went back to the accused's house after both drives. She claimed that she returned because she had left her purse behind. Furthermore, it was the position of the defence that the allegations were made out of spite because the accused had ordered the complainant from his home: because of his and his wife's very constrained financial situation, they simply could not afford to have guests. It is apparent from the transcript that the accused was a poor witness.",

These charges arose from an incident in which the appellant, Mr. Swain, attacked his wife and two infant children in a bizarre manner. Fortunately, Mrs. Swain and the children sustained only superficial physical injuries. At trial, the appellant's wife testified that during the incident Swain appeared to be fighting with the air and talking about spirits. At the time of his arrest, the appellant was very excited and spoke in a \"dialect\" about religious themes. Mr. Swain testified at trial that, during the incident, he felt his family was being attacked by devils and that he had to protect them by carrying out certain acts. On November 1, 1983, the appellant was transferred from the Toronto Jail to the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre pursuant to a Form 1 application under theMental Health Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 262. While at the Centre, Swain behaved in a bizarre and regressive manner. Two anti-psychotic drugs were prescribed and administered to him and his condition improved rapidly. By December 19, 1983, the appellant was released into the community (on the condition that he would continue to see a psychiatrist) on the recommendation of Dr. Fleming, the Director of the forensic unit at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre. Mr. Swain returned briefly to jail and was granted bail on conditions shortly thereafter. The appellant remained on bail until June 10, 1985, and continued to take medication and to see a psychiatrist. On May 3, 1985, Mr. Swain's trial took place in the District Court of Ontario before O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. At trial, the Crown sought to adduce evidence with respect to insanity at the time of the offence, to which the appellant objected. After conducting avoir dire, the trial judge ruled that the Crown could adduce such evidence. At the conclusion of the trial, Mr. Swain was found not guilty by reason of insanity on all counts. Defence counsel then moved to have s. 542(2) of theCode(now s. 614), which provides for the automatic detention at the pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor of an insanity acquittee, declared inoperative on the basis that it violated theCharter.

J. reserved judgment and on June 10, 1985, held that Mr. Swain's constitutional rights were not infringed by s. 542(2) and ordered that the appellant be kept in strict custody at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre in Toronto until the Lieutenant Governor's pleasure was known. Mr. Swain filed a notice of appeal in the Ontario Court of Appeal and applied for bail pending appeal. Martin J.A., in Chambers, adjourned this application in order to permit an early hearing of the appellant's case by the Advisory Review Board (the body which may be appointed to advise the Lieutenant Governor concerning the detention of insanity acquittees). On June 12, 1985, the Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant further detaining the appellant in safe custody in a mental hospital for assessment and report to the Advisory Review Board within 30 days. Neither the appellant nor his counsel received prior notice of this decision, although it would appear that some attempts were made to notify the appellant's counsel. Accordingly, neither the appellant nor his counsel made submissions with respect to this decision. Pursuant to the above-mentioned warrant, Mr. Swain was sent for psychiatric examination and assessment to the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, where he remained a patient in the forensic unit until July 12, 1985. The Advisory Review Board held a review hearing on July 26, 1985, pursuant to the provisions of s. 547 of theCode(now s. 619). The appellant and his counsel were present at this hearing. On August 6, 1985, the Advisory Review Board recommended to the Lieutenant Governor that Mr. Swain should remain in safe custody at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre. Shortly thereafter, the Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant for the further detention of Mr. Swain. The Lieutenant Governor accepted the recommendations of the Board which provided,inter alia, that the administrator of the Queen Street Mental Health Centre have the discretion to permit the appellant to re-enter the community with conditions as to supervision and follow-up treatment. On two occasions (July 30, 1985 and August 20, 1985), the appellant's counsel wrote to the Lieutenant Governor requesting the right to appear and make submissions before the Lieutenant Governor at the time when the recommendation of the Advisory Review Board would be considered.

    "text": "[68]The judge in this case faced a difficult problem and he thought that an intermittent sentence of imprisonment was part of the solution. The judge found the offender, Mr. Middleton, guilty after trial of a number of acts of domestic violence arising from two incidents (2006 CarswellOnt 9387). The first, in September 2004, included an assault that left the appellant's fiancée, who is the mother of his young daughter, with a broken clavicle. The second, in February 2005, included threats and pointing a pellet gun. The judge rightly sought to denounce and deter this sort of senseless brutality and to protect the appellant's fiancée and others. But he was also concerned about the financial impact of a jail sentence on Mr. Middleton's daughter. The judge did not want Mr. Middleton's punishment to deprive his child of the court-ordered financial support he was capable of providing through his well-paid employment. [69]In an attempt to give effect to these competing objectives, the judge imposed a 90-day period of imprisonment to be served intermittently for the assault and concurrent 18-month conditional sentences for the threatening and pointing of the pellet gun, all to be followed by three years of probation. This, the judge thought, would meet the need to impose \"a real jail sentence\" while at the same time allowing Mr. Middleton \"to maintain [his] employment and to continue to support [his] daughter pursuant to the Court Order\" (2006 CarswellOnt 9388, at paras. 6-7).",

    "text": "[80]Following the trial judge's initial charge, the jury returned with the following question: Can we please get a legal definition of reasonable doubt? What things can it be based upon, for example, feelings, intuitions, et cetera? If mostly based on circumstantial evidence, where do we draw the line? Please advise. In his response to this specific question from the jury, the trial judge repeated three more times the incorrect component of this instruction, using the term \"equally\". Because the jury was likely to have paid particular attention to the answer to their question, this would have amplified the misdirection . [81]Pursuant to an objection by defence counsel, the trial judge gave additional instructions, finally using the correct language. However, he did not draw the jury's attention to the repeated error in his previous instructions. On the contrary, he reiterated a statement that he had made to the jury several times before, merely omitting, on this occasion, the incorrect term \"equally\". This could not possibly have dispelled the confusion. [82]We agree with our colleague that jury instructions should be read as a whole. However, this reading must include the correctand the incorrectdirections. The defective statements are not eclipsed by a correct statement of the law elsewhere in the charge. If an incorrect instruction has been given, the trial judge must advert to it and correct it clearly. Otherwise, the unidentified incorrect statements may linger in the juror's minds, creating confusion as to the state of the law and obliging the jury to decide on their own which of the competing expositions of the law to apply to the facts. In this sense, the jurors would be left toinstruct themselvesas to the law they were required to apply in reaching their verdict. [83]In order to ensure that a misdirection to the jury has been successfully rectified, a trial judge will generally have to repeat the direction he or she has given, acknowledge that it was incorrect, tell the jury to put it out of their minds and then tell them in plain and simple terms what the law is:R. v.

    "text": "[4]The encounter at the centre of this appeal occurred at mid-day on November 17, 2003, in the Greenwood and Danforth area of Toronto. With four schools in the area and a history of student assaults, robberies, and drug offences occurring over the lunch hour, the three officers involved in the encounter were on patrol for the purposes of monitoring the area and maintaining a safe student environment. Two of the officers, Constables Worrell and Forde, were dressed in plainclothes and driving an unmarked car. Although on patrol, their primary task was to visit the various schools to determine if there were persons on school property who should not have been there — either non-students or students from another school. The third officer, Constable Gomes, was in uniform and driving a marked police car. On \"directed patrol\", he had been tasked with maintaining a visible police presence in the area in order to provide student reassurance and to deter crime during the high school lunch period. [5]Mr. Grant, a young black man, was walking northbound on Greenwood Avenue when he came to the attention of Constables Worrell and Forde. As the two officers drove past, Cst. Worrell testified that the appellant \"stared\" at them in an unusually intense manner and continued to do so as they proceeded down the street, while at the same time \"fidgeting\" with his coat and pants in a way that aroused their suspicions. Given their purpose for being in the area and based on what he had just seen, Cst. Worrell decided that \"maybe we should have a chat with this guy and see what's up with him\". Worrell wanted to know whether Mr. Grant was a student at one of the schools they were assigned to monitor, and, if he was not, whether he was headed to one of the schools anyway. Noticing Cst. Gomes parked on the street ahead of Mr. Grant, and in light of his uniformed attire, the two plainclothes officers suggested to Cst. Gomes that he \"have a chat\" with the approaching appellant to determine if there was any need for concern. [6]Cst. Gomes then got out of his car and initiated an exchange with Mr. Grant, while standing on the sidewalk directly in his intended path.",

At one point, the appellant, behaving nervously, adjusted his jacket, prompting the officer to ask him to \"keep his hands in front of him\". By this point, the two other officers had returned and parked on the side of the street. [7]Cst. Worrell testified on cross‐examination that he and Cst. Forde pulled up because he got a funny feeling based on Mr. Grant's way of looking over at them, looking around \"all over the place\", and adjusting himself. On direct examination he said that \"[h]e still seemed to be, I don't know, looking a bit nervous the way he was looking around, looking at us, looking around when speaking to Officer Gomes. And at this time, I suggested to my partner, you know, I don't think it would hurt if we just go up to Officer Gomes and just stand by, just to make sure everything was okay.\" Thus, after a brief period observing the exchange from their car, the two officers approached the pair on the sidewalk, identified themselves to the appellant as police officers by flashing their badges, and took up positions behind Cst. Gomes, obstructing the way forward. The exchange between Cst. Gomes and Mr. Grant subsequent to the arrival of the two officers was as follows: Have you ever been arrested before? I got into some trouble about three years ago. Do you have anything on you that you shouldn't? No. Well, I got a small bag of weed. Where is it? It's in my pocket. Is that it? A. (Male puts his head down.) Yeah. Well, no. Do you have other drugs on you? No, I just have the weed, that's it. Well, what is it that you have? I have a firearm. [8]At this point, the officers arrested and searched the appellant, seizing the marijuana and a loaded revolver. They then advised Mr. Grant of his right to counsel and took him to the police station.",

Sellers of the Saskatoon City Police Service saw Mr. Shepherd's vehicle fail to stop at a stop sign and then begin to travel at 20 to 25 kilometres per hour over the posted speed limit. Sellers activated his police cruiser's siren and lights in an effort to get the vehicle to pull over. The vehicle slowed down but did not stop. It then accelerated and changed lanes multiple times over approximately a three-kilometre distance before finally pulling over. [6]Sgt. Sellers approached the vehicle and informed Mr. Shepherd that he was under arrest for failing to stop for the police. Mr. Shepherd explained that he had not stopped because he thought the police car was an ambulance. The officer noted that Mr. Shepherd looked lethargic and fatigued and had red eyes. He could smell alcohol on his breath. He also noted that his movements and speech were slow and deliberate. On the basis of these observations, Sgt. Sellers formed the opinion that Mr. Shepherd was \"intoxicated\". The officer read Mr. Shepherd hisCharterrights and made a breathalyzer demand. [7]Mr. Shepherd was taken to the police station by Cst. Horsley, another officer who arrived at the scene shortly after Mr. Shepherd's arrest. On the way there, Mr. Shepherd repeated his explanation to Cst. Horsley that he thought the police car was an ambulance. Mr. Shepherd provided two breath samples at the police station. At trial, he moved to have the samples excluded on the basis that they were obtained in violation ofss. 8and9of theCharter. [8]The trial judge accepted Sgt. Sellers' evidence that he subjectively believed that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol, but concluded that this belief was not objectively reasonable. In reaching his decision, the trial judge relied heavily on the accused's explanation to Cst. Horsley that he thought the police car was an ambulance. The trial judge noted that this was \"just as valid an explanation\" for Mr. Shepherd's erratic driving as the suggestion that he was impaired by alcohol (Appellant's Record, Part II, at p. 7). The accused's explanation also left the trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the intention to evade police when he failed to stop.",

He acquitted Mr. Shepherd of all charges. [9]The Crown appealed the acquittals on the impaired driving and driving \"over 80\" charges to the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench. Foley J., the summary conviction appeal judge, upheld the trial judge's decision (2006 SKQB 91, 30 M.V.R. (5th) 307). He noted that although the trial judge was wrong to rely on Mr. Shepherd's explanation to Cst. Horsley since it was given subsequent to Sgt. Sellers' demand, an \"identical explanation\" was provided to Sgt. Sellers before the demand was made . Accordingly, Foley J. was of the view that the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice. He also concluded that there was ample evidence to support the trial judge's \"factual finding\" that the officer did not have objective grounds to make the demand . He dismissed the appeal. [10]A majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial (2007 SKCA 29, 45 C.R. (6th) 213). Sherstobitoff J.A. concluded that on the facts as found by the trial judge, the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. He stated that the trial judge failed to give sufficient consideration to the officer's opinion that Mr. Shepherd was intoxicated, while at the same time affording undue weight to the accused's evidence that he thought the police car was an ambulance. Lane J.A. was in substantial agreement with Sherstobitoff J.A., adding that, in his view, the trial judge's acceptance of the accused's explanation for his erratic driving was the result of a misreading of Mr. Shepherd's obligations under theHighway Traffic Act, S.S. 1986, c. H-3.1. Even if the police car had in fact been an ambulance as believed by Mr. Shepherd, his conduct would not have complied with the requirements of s. 67(8) of the Act concerning emergency vehicles.

No roadside sobriety test was administered, and some of the officer's evidence regarding signs of impairment was successfully challenged on cross-examination. [12]Having found aCharterviolation, Smith J.A. then considered whether the samples should be excluded unders. 24(2)of theCharter. Smith J.A.'s analysis centered on whether breath samples obtained in breach of theCharterare subject to automatic exclusion as conscriptive evidence, or whether all three categories of factors inR. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, should be considered in deciding whether to exclude the evidence. She concluded thatR. v. Stillman, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607, did not create an exception for breath samples; as non-discoverable, conscriptive evidence, they were automatically excluded under the trial fairness branch ofCollins. After reviewing cases subsequent toStillmanwhich suggest thatStillmannever intended to create an automatic exclusionary rule for conscriptive evidence, Smith J.A. concluded thatStillmanwas still the leading authority on this point, and thus (barring rare exceptions) such evidence should be excluded without considering the second and third branches of theCollinstest.",

The complainant, who was 16 years of age at the time, had gone out drinking with friends late on the evening of Friday, August 6. She and her friends wanted to attend a house party but they were denied entry. As a result, they went to a park across the street from where the party was taking place. [9]The complainant testified that in addition to alcohol, she had shared a marijuana \"joint\" with some friends. She became dizzy and characterized herself as intoxicated. The complainant passed out and says she awoke with the accused engaging in sexual intercourse with her. The accused admitted speaking to her in the park and trying to help her but denied sexual contact. [10]The accused was charged with sexual assault. As stated by the majority of the Court of Appeal at para. 2, \"the credibility of the complainant and the accused was the central issue for the jury in deciding whether the Crown had proved the offence beyond a reasonable doubt\". [11]The trial judge provided the jury with a thorough 71-page charge. The jury had a written copy of the judge's charge in the jury room. [12]The charge had correctly instructed the jury that, \"[y]ou must find Christopher Layton not guilty of the offence unless Crown counsel satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty.\" [13]The trial judge then went on to explain reasonable doubt: A reasonable doubt is not a far-fetched or frivolous doubt. It is not a doubt based on sympathy or prejudice. Rather, it is a doubt based on reason and common sense. It is a doubt that logically arises from the evidence or lack of evidence or absence of reliable evidence. It is a doubt about an essential element of an offence. It is not enough for you to believe that Mr. Layton is probably or likely guilty. In those circumstances, you must find him not guilty because Crown counsel would have failed to satisfy you of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Proof of probable or likely guilt is not proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. You should also remember, however, that it is nearly impossible to prove anything with absolute certainty. Crown counsel is not required to do so.",

Something less than absolute certainty is required . . ., and something more than probable guilt is required. [A.R., at pp. 115-16] [14]The jury deliberated all day but did not reach a verdict.

Defence counsel, Mr. Cramer, stated: Well, the only thing is I think they're confused about what balance of probabilities means and . . . . [A.R., at pp. 155-56] Crown counsel, Mr. Ullrich, said: But again, I think we're conceding what Mr. Cramer said. The concept of balance of probabilities might be the sticking point here, given the way that they've worded the question as well it seems to be that that might be one of the issues in their minds.

Ms. Ettinger had tried to end their relationship, asking him to move out of her apartment, but he refused to leave and instead made an attempt at reconciliation. Eventually they went to bed, at which point the appellant tried to become intimate and to remove Ms. Ettinger's clothing. She resisted, and called out to the neighbours through the bedroom wall to get them to call the police. The appellant brought her the phone himself so she could make the call. [5]According to the transcript of her conversation with the RCMP dispatcher, Ms. Ettinger suggested that the argument could become \"physical\", and she told the dispatcher that the appellant had said he was prepared to put up a fight when the police arrived. Once the call had ended, the appellant removed a shotgun from the closet — he claimed that he felt this would make her stop arguing — and pumped it to show that it was loaded. This caused a live round to eject, which he placed back in the gun before returning it to the closet. The appellant then had a cigarette and coffee while waiting for the police to arrive. Ms. Ettinger testified that the appellant double-checked the gun in the closet when Cst. Seewald knocked on the door, and put it back when Ms. Ettinger admonished him to do so. The appellant denied having done this. [6]When Cst. Seewald arrived, Ms. Ettinger answered the door and informed him that the appellant had a gun before letting him into the apartment. The officer assured her that everything would be fine and entered the apartment. Ms. Ettinger testified that no guns were visible in the apartment at that time. Once inside, the officer asked the appellant to sit down in the living room. According to the appellant, he refused to sit down and Cst. Seewald then pushed him into a chair, ripping his T-shirt in the process. Ms. Ettinger left the room to get him a new shirt. In her absence, the appellant claimed, he stood up from the chair and the officer started to pepper-spray him, causing intense pain and a burning sensation in his eyes.",

Ms. Ettinger did not hear or see anything while she was getting the shirt, but she testified that when she returned to the living room, the appellant was trying to shield his eyes from the pepper spray, exclaiming that it hurt. [7]Ms. Ettinger then recalled seeing the appellant and Cst. Seewald struggling with each other in the living room and moving out onto the porch, where the struggle continued. She did not see either of them pick up the shotgun, but first noticed it when the two men were outside on the porch. She testified that they both had their hands on the weapon, and that Cst. Seewald had said something like \"Give me the gun\", while pushing down on the barrel. Finally, she heard a shot and saw a bright flash. Constable Seewald exclaimed \"I'm shot\" and fell to the ground. A neighbour testified that she heard Ms. Ettinger cry out \"No, don't\" before the shot was fired. Ms. Ettinger recalled screaming after the officer was shot, and described a look of disbelief on the appellant's face. [8]At trial, to counter the appellant's claim that the shot was fired accidentally in a struggle over the gun, the Crown led expert evidence on the likely distance from which the shot was fired. According to Dr. Bannach, a forensic pathologist, the scalloped edges of the wound were consistent with a shot fired from a distance of at least three feet, while the existence of satellite wounds and the presence of plastic wads extended the likely distance to between four and eight feet. Mr. Voth, an RCMP forensic firearms expert, offered a similar estimate that the shot was fired at a distance of between two and five feet; his estimate was based on his analysis of gunshot residue on Cst. Seewald's parka and on a parka similar in make and style to the one worn by the officer on the night of the shooting. Mr. Voth also testified that the gun could not have discharged accidentally or as a result of being dropped or struck.",

The incident leading to the charge was a fist fight between the two men, in a parking lot outside a hotel near Sudbury, Ontario, on September 19, 1986. At the date of the killing, Rodney Haggart was 25 years old. He had consumed some beer. His blood alcohol level, measured a few hours after the incident, was 160 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, but the trial judge found that Haggart appeared \"perfectly fine\" and \"perfectly normal\". Jobidon, a young, fit and powerful man, had also been drinking beer prior to the fight, but in the opinion of the trial judge was not inebriated. The two men initiated their aggression in the bar of the hotel. With his brother and a few friends, Haggart was celebrating his impending marriage. He approached Jobidon, who was also in the hotel with friends, and started a fight with him. Haggart was larger than the appellant, and had previous training as a boxer. In this first encounter, Haggart was prevailing when the owner of the hotel separated the combatants and told Jobidon and his brother to leave the hotel. Jobidon and Haggart exchanged angry words in the lobby, and the trial judge found that the two men agreed the fight was not over. Jobidon and his brother waited outside in the parking lot. When the Haggart party exited the hotel their respective older brothers began fighting at the far end of the lot. Jobidon and Haggart argued. A crowd of people, many of whom had come outside to see the fight, gathered around them. While Haggart and Jobidon stood facing each other, Jobidon struck Haggart with his fist, hitting him with great force on the head and face. Haggart was knocked backward onto the hood of a car. The trial judge determined that Haggart was rendered unconscious by this initial punch and that he appeared to be \"out cold\". He was not moving and offered no resistance to the appellant. Immediately after throwing that first punch, Jobidon continued forward. In a brief flurry lasting no more than a few seconds he struck the unconscious victim a further four to six times on the head.",

In a brief flurry lasting no more than a few seconds he struck the unconscious victim a further four to six times on the head. The trial judge found that there was no interval between Haggart's fall and the continued punching. The punches were part of \"one single continuing transaction . . . one fluid event, punctuated by specific blows\". The judge noted that the most reliable witness testified that it all happened so quickly he thought Haggart would bounce off the hood and resume the fight. Instead, Haggart rolled off the hood and lay limp. He was taken to the hospital in a coma, where he died of severe contusions to the head. Medical evidence showed that he had sustained extensive bruising and abrasions to the head and neck. It was determined that the cause of death was one or more of the punches he had received at the hand of the appellant in the parking lot. The trial judge found that Jobidon did not intend to kill Haggart, nor did he intend to cause the deceased serious bodily harm. However, the possibility of injury more serious than a bruise or bloody nose, such as a broken nose, was contemplated. Jobidon intentionally hit Haggart as hard as he could, but believed he was fighting fair. He did not depart intentionally from the kind of fight that Haggart had consented to. Jobidon believed that Haggart had consented to a fair fight, the object of which was to hit the other man as hard as physically possible until that person gave up or retreated. The trial judge also found that, although mistaken, and not supported by objective facts, Jobidon honestly believed that after Haggart had been struck onto the hood of the car he was merely stunned, but still capable of fighting back, and still trying to fight. Jobidon was tried before a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, and was found not guilty of manslaughter: (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 340. The judge held that Haggart's consent negated assault, and held further that Jobidon had not been criminally negligent.",

    "text": "[48]Indeed, the sentencing regime under Canadian law must be implemented within, and not apart from, the framework of theCharter. Sentencing decisions are always subject to constitutional scrutiny. A sentence cannot be \"fit\" if it does not respect the fundamental values enshrined in theCharter. Thus, incidents alleged to constitute aCharterviolation can be considered in sentencing, provided that they bear the necessary connection to the sentencing exercise. As mitigating factors, the circumstances of the breach would have to align with the circumstances of the offence or the offender, as required by s. 718.2 of theCode. Naturally, the more egregious the breach, the more attention the court will likely pay to it in determining a fit sentence. [49]This is consistent with the communicative function of sentencing. A proportionate sentence is one that expresses, to some extent, society's legitimate shared values and concerns. As Lamer C.J. stated inM. (C.A.): Our criminal law is also a system of values. A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated. In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by theCriminal Code. [para. 81] A sentence that takes account of aCharterviolation is therefore able to communicate respect for the shared set of values expressed in theCharter. In the words of Professor Allan Manson: The communicative function of sentencing is all about conveying messages. The messages are directed to the community. They are about the values which ought to be important to the community. (\"CharterViolations in Mitigation of Sentence\" (1995), 41 C.R. (4th) 318, at p. 323) Indeed,s. 718of theCriminal Codedescribes the fundamental purpose of sentencing as that of contributing to \"respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society\". This function must be understood as providing scope for sentencing judges to consider not only the actions of the offender, but also those of state actors.",

Provided that the impugned conduct relates to the individual offender and the circumstances of his or her offence, the sentencing process includes consideration of society's collective interest in ensuring that law enforcement agents respect the rule of law and the shared values of our society. [50]The conclusion that the circumstances of allegedCharterbreaches can be considered during sentencing, when they are relevant to the offender and to the offence, is consistent with much of the sentencing jurisprudence. In several cases, courts have reduced a sentence to reflect the prejudice caused to the accused by the incident giving rise to aCharterviolation, without invoking s. 24(1). For instance, inR. v. Munoz, 2006 ABQB 901, 69 Alta. L.R. (4th) 231, an offender's overall sentence was reduced to take account of the breach of his s. 7 and s. 12 rights by police guards. While awaiting trial for serious offences including robbery and aggravated assault, the accused was subject to acts of physical violence by the guards and was forced to wear a degrading prisoner uniform called a \"baby doll\". Writing for the court, Wilkins J. described the accused's treatment at the hands of the police as \"grossly disproportionate to the punishment that was appropriate\" . He held that a fit sentence, notwithstanding theCharterbreaches, would have been seven years' imprisonment, on the high end of the scale for those particular offences. Taking the breaches into account, and after ordering an enhanced credit of 33 months for time served in the remand facility, he ordered a sentence of two years less a day in jail. The court did not cites. 24(1)of theCharteras authority for the sentence reduction. [51]Perhaps more instructive to the current appeal isR. v. Pigeon(1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (B.C.C.A.), which illustrates the court's authority to address police violence within the context of ordinary sentencing principles. The offender was a Chilcotin man who had fled from police after committing a break and enter. After an officer fired a shot into the air, Mr. Pigeon returned from whence he had fled — unarmed and unaggressive — with the intent to surrender. The officer grabbed Mr. Pigeon by the hair and threw him onto the pavement.",

Rather than handcuff the accused at this point, the officer lifted him back up and dragged him by the hair to where the other officer was stationed. He threw him onto the ground again and, with the other officer's foot firmly placed on the accused's neck, handcuffed him. Mr. Pigeon did not resist arrest or attempt to escape at any time. [52]The accused was convicted and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment followed by 18 months' probation. The trial judge acknowledged the injuries suffered by Mr. Pigeon during his arrest, but concluded that the officer's use of force was irrelevant to the offender's sentence: Although you deserve some sympathy on account of that ill treatment, it is not a factor that I am prepared to take into consideration. You have a civil remedy. After releasing those reasons, the trial judge filed a formal report to the Court of Appeal recommending a reduced sentence of six months' imprisonment. He wrote: I refused to take into account the assaults that the accused had suffered at the hands of the police, and told him that he had a civil remedy for that. On reflection I am of the view that effect ought to have been given to the assaults. Had I considered it appropriate to do so I would have further reduced the term of imprisonment by three months to six months. . . . I am respectfully of the view that it is not in the public interest that police constables should be perceived as \"getting away\" [with] ill treating aboriginal people, and I am no longer of the view that a civil remedy is the proper form of redress. On appeal, Carrothers J.A. accepted the trial judge's findings that the degree of force used by police was unwarranted and excessive. He noted that, although the court is \"not sitting in judgment of the police\", it is within the ambit of the appellate court's review of the fitness of the sentence to consider all that is known about the offender and the offence, along with the \"realities and complexion of the community . . . which are relevant to and bear upon the public perception of justice\" (p. 343).",

    "text": "In light of these considerations, Carrothers J.A. ordered a reduced sentence of six months' imprisonment, falling to the low end of the scale of sentences for similar offences. [53]It is important to note that a sentence can be reduced in light of state misconduct even when the incidents complained of do not rise to the level of aCharterbreach. InPigeon, the court did not need to determine whether the accused's s. 7 rights had been violated, as there was sufficient scope within the regular sentencing process to address the impropriety of the police officers' actions. Likewise, the Ontario Court of Appeal held inR. v. Bosley(1992), 18 C.R. (4th) 347, that the trial judge had properly considered excessive but not unconstitutional delay as a mitigating factor in his determination of a fit sentence (see alsoR. v. Leaver(1996), 3 C.R. (5th) 138 (Ont. C.A.)). And inR. v. Panousis, 2002 ABQB 1109, 329 A.R. 47, the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench treated the delay in the proceedings as a relevant mitigating factor that led to a reduced sentence for the offence of trafficking in cocaine. Although the delay did not amount to a s. 11(b) violation, the court held that it had caused prejudice to the accused that was relevant and probative to the sentencing process. The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal, in brief oral reasons (2004 ABCA 211 (CanLII)), reversed the trial judge's decision and imposed a sentence of incarceration of two years less a day and a heavy fine. The majority did not state whether it disagreed with the trial judge's finding that delay was a relevant mitigating circumstance, but it is notable that its final sentence went below the trial judge's appreciation of the usual sentences for serious drug offences. [54]To be certain, the concept of recognizing harm or prejudice caused to the offender as a mitigating circumstance upon sentencing did not originate with theCharter. In the pre-Chartercase ofR. v. Kirzner(1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 665, the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a sentence for drug offences to reflect the police force's role in exposing the offender to the opportunity to commit the offences for which he was convicted. The RCMP had used the offender, who was addicted to heroin, as an informer to infiltrate and gain information about the drug trade in Montreal.",

The court found that, although the defence of entrapment was not available to the accused, the police were sufficiently implicated in the offender's actions to warrant a reduction of his sentence. Likewise, the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a sentence in the pre-Chartercontext to mitigate the effects of an unlawful search of the accused's premises inR. v. Steinberg, [1967] 1 O.R. 733. Excessive delay attributable to the prosecution or police has also been considered a mitigating factor in a number of pre-Chartercases (R. v. Cooper (No. 2)(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 35 (Ont. C.A.);R. v. Simon(1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 159 (Ont. C.A.)). Likewise, delay arising out of strategically delayed charges in respect of contemporaneous offences has led to reduction of the sentences (R. v. Parisien(1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 433 (B.C.C.A.);R. v. Burke, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 124 (Ont. C.A.);R. v. Fairn(1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 423 (N.S. Co. Ct.)). [55]Thus, a sentencing judge may take into account police violence or other state misconduct while crafting a fit and proportionate sentence, without requiring the offender to prove that the incidents complained of amount to aCharterbreach. Provided the interests at stake can properly be considered by the court while acting within the sentencing regime in theCriminal Code, there is simply no need to turn to theCharterfor a remedy. However, if aCharterbreach has already been alleged and established, a trial judge should not be prevented from reducing the sentence accordingly, so long as the incidents giving rise to the breach are relevant to the usual sentencing regime. Of course, as we shall see, as a general rule, a court cannot reduce a sentence below a mandatory minimum or order a reduced sentence that is not provided for by statute. That said, circumstances of aCharterbreach or other instances of state misconduct, in exceptional circumstances, do allow a court to derogate from the usual rules to which its decisions are subject.",

In particular, para. 5 of the ITO, the first to adduce specific facts in support of the application, contains two glaring and misleading inaccuracies. It states, first, that \"[o]nce on the computer HOUNJET observed 'Lolita Porn' on the screen\", and then that Mr. Hounjet \"returned the next day to find the porn removed\". [46]The clear implication of these assertions is that Mr. Hounjet in fact saw \"Lolita Porn\" (pornography involving young girls) on the screen and that he determined that this pornography was subsequently removed from the computer. But Mr. Hounjet saw nothing of the sort. As is clear from thevoir dire, all he saw were two links labelled \"Lolita Porn\" and \"Lolita XXX\" in the \"Favourites\" menu of the Internet browser. \"Favourites\" or bookmarks are nothing more than \"menu entries\" that serve as shortcuts that provide easy access to an Internet site. [47]Justice Deschamps finds (at para. 155) that \"[t]here could be no confusion about what was seen.\" I respectfully disagree. Nowhere does the ITO disclaim the clear statement in para. 5 that Mr. Hounjet saw \"Lolita Porn\" and that \"the porn\" was subsequently removed. While para. 10 does specify that Mr. Hounjet saw \"Lolita Porn\" and \"Lolita XXX\"icons, the last sentence of that very paragraph perpetuates the impression thatactualchild pornography (rather than links) was seen: It asserts that when Mr. Hounjet arrived the next day \"all the child porn off the computer was gone\". [48]There is no reasonable basis for assuming that the justice of the peace would have understood these clear and misleading statements to refer exclusively to the icons mentioned in para. 10.

This is an entirely false claim, and these statements must therefore be excised from the ITO. [49]Aside from false statements, the ITO in several places gave an incomplete and misleading account of the facts, in contravention of the informant's duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material information. [50]For example, thevoir direrevealed that the two bookmarks described in the ITO — the bookmarks labelled \"Lolita Porn\" and \"Lolita XXX\" — were \"just scattered through the favourites\" among additional links pointing to \"regular adult material\" (Testimony of Adrian Hounjet at thevoir dire, A.R., at pp. 98-100). This is not mentioned at all in the ITO. [51]Moreover, the only pornographic image that Mr. Hounjet actually did see — an image on the accused's computer desktop or Internet homepage — was perfectly legal adult pornography. The failure to mention these facts creates a misleading impression that the accused was particularly inclined towards child pornography or exclusively seeking it out. [52]Once it is clearly understood that the suspicious \"Favourites\" were in fact anomalies or exceptions, found together with much more material that was undisputedly legal, the inference that the accused possessed illegal images — or that evidence of criminal possession would be found upon a search of the computer — becomes significantly less compelling. [53]Similarly, the ITO placed great emphasis on the presence of a \"web-cam pointing towards [children's] toys\", and noted also that \"[t]he client was alone in the house with a three year old child\" (ITO, at para. 5). Indeed, these statements appear in the very first substantive paragraph of the ITO. Later in the ITO, one learns that the webcam was not hooked up to the computer but was rather plugged into a VCR that recorded to videotape . [54]The descriptions of the webcam and its placement are juxtaposed immediately alongside the descriptions of the suspicious \"Favourites\" and the claims that Mr. Hounjet had \"observed 'Lolita Porn'\". The ITO thus invited the justice of the peace to make an unwarranted connection between the two \"Lolita\" bookmarks and the webcam trained at the children's play area.",

Read as a whole, the ITO could thus be understood to allege that the accused had made and possessed his own illegal pornography, in addition to possessing images from the Internet on his computer. [55]The informant's narrative would have appeared much less sinister — and much less supportive of the claim that the accused possessed child pornography — had the ITO included a number of additional facts known to the police. [56]First, the three-year old child mentioned (but not identified) in the ITO was in fact the accused's daughter. Second, the ITO stated that the accused was alone in the house with the girl, but failed to mention that his wife lived with them. Third, the ITO failed to mention that the child was fully clothed, that there was no evidence of abuse, that the computer room had a child gate and appeared to double as a playroom for the child, and that the child was playing with the scattered toys in the middle of the room when Mr. Hounjet arrived, before being taken out of the room by the accused (A.R., at pp. 206-10). [57]These omitted facts all tend to undermine suspicions about the accused. Once they are added to the picture, it seems much more plausible that the accused was simply using the VCR and webcam to videotape his young daughter at play for posterity's sake, rather than for any purpose connected to child pornography. [58]In failing to provide these details, the informant failed to respect his obligation as a police officer to make full and frank disclosure to the justice. When seeking anex parteauthorization such as a search warrant, a police officer — indeed, any informant — must be particularly careful not to \"pick and choose\" among the relevant facts in order to achieve the desired outcome.

[63]Essentially, only two inferential paths could have led the justice to conclude that the warrant should issue: (1) the two suspicious bookmarks; (2) the claims about the propensity of certain \"types of offenders\" to hoard images, combined with reason to believe that the accused is of that \"type\". In my view, both paths lead instead to an evidentiary dead end: they culminate in suspicion and conjecture, never reaching the mandatory threshold of reasonable and probable grounds to believe. [64]The presence of the two \"Lolita\" links in the Favourites certainly supports a reasonable inference that the accused browsed a Web site that contained explicit images of females under the age of 18. And it is not unreasonable to infer from the mere presence of the links on the appellant's computer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they were knowingly added by him. [65]This does not suffice, however, to establish possession. First, as earlier explained, merely browsing a Web site or viewing images onscreen does not constitute possession. Neither does creating a bookmark on one's computer establish possession over the content of the Web site: bookmarks merely provide quick and easyaccessto the indicated Web sites. Indeed, clicking on a bookmark may simply disclose that material previously on the Web site has been removed; that material previously absent has been added; that the Web site address is no longer valid — or that the Web site no longer exists at all.

[67]Even if one takes the broader view that possession is complete on merely viewing images on-screen, other facts in the ITO preclude the possibility of inferring from the icons alone that evidence of the crime would be found in the appellant's computer. [68]Specifically, the ITO states that on the day after the icons were viewed, the computer's hard drive was \"formatted\". On thevoir dire, it was confirmed that this meant that the entire contents of the hard drive were deleted. Not only would the suspicious links have thus been erased, but illegal image files in the computer and any files evidencing past access to Web sites containing illegal images (such as browser histories or cache files) would also have been removed. Normally, moreover, the greater the lapse of time after a hard drive has been formatted, the more likely it will be impossible to recover the former contents of the drive using forensic tools. In this case, four months had passed. And, in any event, the nature of \"formatting\" and data retention on computer drives was not sufficiently described in the ITO to permit issuance of the warrant on these grounds. [69]To conclude that evidence of possession would be found four months after the hard drive was erased, one must therefore accept either that the accused had made external copies of illegal images present in the computer before formatting its hard drive or that he acquired additional illegal images after the formatting. [70]Both possibilities require drawing inferences based on the likely behaviour of the accused.

[71]In my view, the ITO does not establish either the veracity of the generalization about the alleged \"type of offender\", nor that the accused is in fact the \"type\" to which the generalization might have applied. [72]More specifically, the ITO makes two statements about the \"propensities\" of offenders. It first states that \"these type[s] of offenders are habitual and will continue their computer practices with child pornography\" (ITO, at para. 12). This claim is attributed to Corporal Boyce of the RCMP Technological Crime Unit. The ITO also claims that \"offenders treasure collections on their computer and like to store them and create backup's [sic] in case they loose [sic] it. Discs and floppy disks are used for this purpose. Offenders will typically sort information and store pictures on different file names to catagorize [sic] them.\" (ITO, at para. 13). This statement is attributed to Constable Huisman of the Saskatoon Police Service Vice Unit. [73]The main difficulty with these generalizations about certain \"types of offenders\" is that they are entirely devoid of meaningful factual support. The ITO contains no evidentiary material in this regard, even anecdotal, apart from the bald assertion of the two police officers. Furthermore, there is virtually nothing to describe, let alone establish, the expertise of the officers to whom the claims are attributed. The only information provided in the ITO consists in the officers' names, positions, and places of work. This is surely an insufficient evidentiary basis to enable a justice of the peace, hearing an applicationex parte, to determine that the generalization is sufficiently credible or reliable to form the basis for a finding of reasonable and probable grounds. [74]The amplification evidence presented on thevoir direis of little assistance to the Crown.

Huisman, and his understanding that Cst. Huisman had previously worked on unspecified \"child exploitation offences\". Ochitwa's testimony does not mention any knowledge of the relevant experience that Cst. Huisman may have had or the basis for his opinions about the proclivities of child pornography offenders (Testimony of Cst. Ochitwa, A.R., at pp. 158-59 and 192-94). [75]The evidence presented at thevoir direwith respect to Cpl. Boyce's statements is more problematic still. Ochitwa testified that he approached Cpl. Boyce in order to obtain information about \"how computers operate\" because \"[Cpl. Boyce] was involved with the term [sic] technological crime\". Boyce thus appears to have been sought out as an expert oncomputer technology, not the habits of child pornography offenders. While Cst. Ochitwa was aware that Cpl. Boyce worked in the Technological Crime Unit and knew what his duties were there — investigating crimes involving computers — there is no indication at all whether or how his work in that unit formed the basis for his opinions about child pornography offenders (Testimony of Cst. Ochitwa, A.R., at pp. 157-58 and 191-92). [76]Perhaps even more troubling than the paucity of information as to the basis for the officers' opinions is the fact that the class of persons to whom specific proclivities are attributed is defined so loosely as to bear no real significance. Both officers speak about the propensities of undefined \"types of offenders\" or simply \"offenders\". [77]While it is clear from the context that the officers are referring to some variety of child pornography offenders, it cannot be assumed, without evidence, that broad but meaningful generalizations can be made about all persons who commit (or are suspected of committing) child pornography offences. For example, a person with an exclusive interest in child pornography is surely of a different \"type\" than a person who is primarily or exclusively interested in legal adult images, but has nevertheless downloaded a small number of illegal images.",

There is no reason to believe, on the basis of the information in the ITO, thatallchild pornography offenders engage in hoarding, storing, sorting, and categorizing activity. And there is nothing in the ITO that indicates which specific subset of these offenders does generally engage in those activities. [79]To permit reliance on broad generalizations about loosely defined classes of people is to invite dependence on stereotypes and prejudices in lieu of evidence. I am thus unable to agree with Justice Deschamps (at para. 162) that the ITO's claims in this regard could properly be relied on by the justice. [80]Justice Deschamps supports her reliance on claims about the behaviour of \"types of offenders\" by citing child pornography cases in which courts, in her view, have accepted the tendency of certain kinds of child pornography offenders to collect many images and store them over long periods of time . These decisions are rather in favour of the conclusion that an evidentiary basis is required to support a finding as to the characteristics or propensities of child pornography offenders. [81]That some child pornography offenders do seek out and hoard illegal images is, of course, neither surprising nor helpful in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds exist in a particular case. Still, it is not the role of courts to establish by judicial fiat broad generalizations regarding the \"proclivities\" of certain \"types\" of people, including offenders.

    "text": "Matters of this sort are best left to be established by the Crown, according to the relevant standard — in this case, reasonable and probable grounds for belief. As suggested earlier, moreover, courts must be particularly wary of endorsing such generalizations when, as in this case, the crime alleged is the subject of intense emotional responses and widespread condemnation, and the temptation to rely on stereotype rather that evidence is therefore especially dangerous and strong. [82]An evidentiary basis is required as well for a finding of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the alleged offender belongs to the class of child pornography offenders whose characteristics or propensities are mentioned in the ITO. This view of the law was adopted inR. v. Fawthrop(2002), 161 O.A.C. 350, the only Canadian appellate decision cited by Justice Deschamps. My colleague finds in that decision support for her suggestion that general opinions on the propensity of child pornography offenders to collect and hoard child pornography material can give rise to reasonable and probable grounds for issuing search warrants. With respect, I readFawthropdifferently. As noted earlier,Fawthropaffirms the need for evidence both as to characteristics of an identified class of child pornography offenders, and as to the offender's membership in that class. [83]As Borins J.A., speaking for the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, explained inFawthrop(at para. 42): In my view, the trial judge's finding, based on the testimony of Det. Const. Pulkki, that the police were engaged in a \"fishing expedition\" for items of child pornography leads to the conclusion that the breach of the appellant'ss. 8Charterrights was serious. It appears from the record that after she interviewed A.Y. and members of her family, Det. Const. Pulkki suspected that the appellant was a pedophile, which led her to further suspect that he might possess items of child pornography. To be fair to her, she realized that her suspicion was insufficient to enable her to obtain a warrant. She was aware that it was necessary that she have reasonable grounds to believe that child pornography would be located in the appellant's home. She sought the opinion of Dr. Collins in the hope that it would tip the scales from suspicion to reasonable grounds. As the trial judge recognized, the opinion of Dr. Collins failed to do so. He recognized the fatal flaw in the opinion.",

    "text": "As the trial judge recognized, the opinion of Dr. Collins failed to do so. He recognized the fatal flaw in the opinion. Although Dr. Collins opined that it was not uncommon for pedophiles to collect items of child pornography, he was unable to form an opinion as to whether the appellant was a pedophile. Without that link, Det. Const. Pulkki was in the same position as she had been before she contacted Dr. Collins. All she had was a suspicion that the appellant might be in possession of child pornography. . . . This resulted in an unauthorized search for those items by means of what the trial judge correctly labelled a \"fishing expedition\". This is what the search warrant process is meant to prevent. In the result, the evidence seized under the warrant was excluded pursuant tos. 24(2)of theCharter. [84]In short, in most of the cases cited by my colleague, the original warrant application included relatively detailed descriptions of the habits of a specific class of child pornography offender. They thus provided evidence sufficient to establish a credible profile of a class of child pornography collectors and their typical behaviours, and a proper factual foundation for concluding that the alleged offender belonged to that class. This is not our case. [85]Here, even if the impugned generalizations are accepted, the ITO as amplified does not reasonably permit the inference that the accused was the \"type of offender\" who sought out illegal pornography and stored it. This requirement was well explained inUnited States v. Weber, 923 F.2d 1338 (9th Cir. 1990), at p. 1345: \"[I]f the government presents expert opinion about the behavior of a particular class of persons, for the opinion to have any relevance, the affidavit must lay a foundation which shows that the person subject to the search is a member of the class.\" [86]Two suspiciously labelled links in the \"Favourites\" menu do not suffice to characterize a person as an habitual child pornography offender of the type that seeks out and hoards illegal images.",

    "text": "Indeed, the fact that the bulk of the pornographic material that Mr. Hounjet observed at the accused's house was perfectly legal adult pornography suggests that the accused did not have a \"pronounced\" interest in child pornography at all, contrary to my colleague's assertion (paras. 177 and 179). [87]Also, and again with respect, the cases my colleague relies on (at para. 173) do not support the notion that a warrant can be issued months after a person might have merely viewed child pornography. For example, inUnited States v. Terry, 522 F.3d 645 (6th Cir. 2008), the warrant was issued on a probable cause finding that the accusedhad in fact saved child pornography on his computer five months earlier. Also, the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal inR. v. Graham, 2008 PESCAD 7, 277 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 103, neither upheld the warrant nor affirmed the trial judge's finding as to the effect of the passage of time. [88]More broadly, Justice Deschamps may be understood to permit reasonable and probable grounds for belief to rest on evidence that has only a tenuous relation to the crime in question — possessing illegal child pornography. [89]For example, my colleague is of the view that the presence of the webcam, which was functioning effectively as a camcorder recording to a VCR, \"showed that [the accused] was interested in reproducing images, accumulating such material, and keeping it for his future use\", showed that the accused \"was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography\" . With respect, neither the legal nor the logical relevance of these considerations is apparent to me. [90]While it may be true that the accused was adept at recording videotapes and storing the tapes for future use — as is nearly everyone who owns a camcorder — this says absolutely nothing about his propensity to store a completely different kind of image (child pornography), in a completely different medium (a computer, as opposed to videotape), acquired in a completely different manner (downloading, as opposed to filming). [91]The mere fact that a person collects, reproduces, or storesanything— music files, letters, stamps, and so forth — hardly supports an inference that he or she is of the type to hoard illegal images.",

    "text": "To draw that inference here is to speculate impermissibly. At its highest, the proposed inference might provoke suspicion in some. And, as a matter of law, suspicion is no substitute for reasonable and probable grounds to believe either that the appellant committed the alleged offence or that evidence of the offence would be found in his computer. [92]Nor do I consider that the accused's conduct after the visit — tidying up the room and formatting the hard drive — supports the conclusion that the accused was the sort of person to seek out and hoard child pornography. [93]Justice Deschamps contends that these actions were evidence of a \"desire not to arouse suspicion with respect to his reproduction of images or his computer practices\" and that the conduct created \"a credibly based probability that the appellant was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography\" . [94]In my view, there is an obvious and innocent explanation for this conduct that is at least as plausible: The accused might well have tidied up and formatted his computer simply to avoid further embarrassment from having an outsider see the disorderly state of his home and the evidence of his consumption of pornography on his computer. Again, the accused's conduct might raise suspicions, but it establishes nothing more. [95]In short, as mentioned at the outset, the ITO in this case is reduced by scrutiny to two links in the browser's list of \"Favourites\" — links that were known to have been erased four months earlier. At best, this may be a ground for suspicion, but surely the deleted links afford no reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant was in possession of child pornography, and still less that evidence of that crime would be found upon a search of his computer. [96]Once the material facts omitted from the ITO are taken into consideration, it is apparent that none of the other evidence in the ITO — principally the presence of the webcam and the claims about propensities of unspecified \"types of offenders\" — can elevate mere suspicion into sufficient grounds for a warrant. [97]Because the warrant should not have issued, the subsequent search violateds. 8of theCharter.",

    "text": "VI [98]To determine whether the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal search should be excluded under s. 24(2), we are bound to apply the test recently set out inGrant, at para. 71: [U]nder s. 24(2), a court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society's confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of theCharter‐infringing state conduct (admission may send the message the justice system condones serious state misconduct), (2) the impact of the breach on theCharter‐protected interests of the accused (admission may send the message that individual rights count for little), and (3) society's interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. The court's role on a s. 24(2) application is to balance the assessments under each of these lines of inquiry to determine whether, considering all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I shall consider these three factors in turn. [99]First, theCharter‐infringing state conduct in this case was the search of the accused's home and the seizure of his personal computer, his wife's laptop computer, several videotapes, and other items. The search and seizure were unwarranted, but not warrantless: they were conducted pursuant to a search warrant by officers who believed they were acting under lawful authority. The executing officers did not wilfully or even negligently breach theCharter. These considerations favour admission of the evidence. To that extent, the search and seizure cannot be characterized as particularly egregious. [100]The opposite is true on considering the ITO upon which the warrant was obtained. The officer whopreparedthe ITO was neither reasonably diligent nor mindful of his duty to make full and frank disclosure. At best, the ITO was improvidently and carelessly drafted. Not only did the ITO fail to specify the correct offence (accessing*rather than possession of child pornography); it was also drafted in a misleading way, resulting in the issuance of a warrant on insufficient grounds.",

While the trial judge found no deliberate attempt to mislead, no attesting officer, acting reasonably, could have failed to appreciate that repeated references to \"'Lolita Porn' on the screen\" and to the deletion of \"all the child porn off the computer\" would cause most readers — and, more particularly, the issuing justice — to believe there was evidence that child pornography was actually viewed on-screen by the witness Hounjet. [101]Similarly, the officer should have known — if he in fact did not — that the immediate juxtaposition of these misleading statements and the incomplete description of the \"web-cam pointing towards toys\" would be unjustifiably inflammatory. [102]The repute of the administration of justice is jeopardized by judicial indifference to unacceptable police conduct. Police officers seeking search warrants are bound to act with diligence and integrity, taking care to discharge the special duties of candour and full disclosure that attach inex parteproceedings. In discharging those duties responsibly, they must guard against making statements that are likely to mislead the justice of the peace. They must refrain from concealing or omitting relevant facts. And they must take care not to otherwise exaggerate the information upon which they rely to establish reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of a search warrant. [103]We are bound to accept the trial judge's finding that there was no deliberate misconduct on the part of the officer who swore the Information. The repute of the administration of justice would nonetheless be significantly eroded, particularly in the long term, if such unacceptable police conduct were permitted to form the basis for so intrusive an invasion of privacy as the search of our homes and the seizure and scrutiny of our personal computers. [104]I turn in that light to the second factor set out inGrant: The impact of the breach on theCharter-protected interests of the accused. The intrusiveness of the search is of particular importance in this regard. Our concern here is with the search of the appellant's home, in itself a serious breach of the appellant's rights unders. 8of theCharter. But there is more.",

The infringement in this case involved a search of the appellant's personal computer — and his wife's laptop computer as well. In passing, I recall here the Informant's failure to mention that the appellant lived with his wife. This not only cast a dark light in the appellant's presence alone with their child — perfectly understandable in the circumstances — but may also explain why the laptop, which was in fact not his, was seized and presumably scrutinized as well. [105]As I mentioned at the outset, it is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and read, watch, or listen to on the Internet. [106]It is therefore difficult to conceive a s. 8 breach with a greater impact on theCharter-protected privacy interests of the accused than occurred in this case. [107]I turn, finally, to the third factor to be weighed unders. 24(2)of theCharter— society's interest in adjudication of the case on its merits.

It would thus seriously undermine the truth-seeking function of the trial, a factor that weighs against exclusion (Grant, at paras. 79-83). [108]In balancing these considerations, we are required byGrantto bear in mind the long-term and prospective repute of the administration of justice, focussing less on the particular case than on the impact over time of admitting the evidence obtained by infringement of the constitutionally protected rights of the accused. [109]In my view, the repute of the administration of justice will be significantly undermined if criminal trials are permitted to proceed on the strength of evidence obtained from the most private \"place\" in the home on the basis of misleading, inaccurate, and incomplete Informations upon which a search warrant was issued. [110]Justice is blind in the sense that it pays no heed to the social status or personal characteristics of the litigants. But justice receives a black eye when it turns a blind eye to unconstitutional searches and seizures as a result of unacceptable police conduct or practices. [111]The public must have confidence that invasions of privacy are justified, in advance, by a genuine showing of probable cause. To admit the evidence in this case and similar cases in the future would undermine that confidence in the long term. [112]I am persuaded for all of these reasons that admitting the illegally obtained evidence in this case would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. [113]I would therefore exclude that evidence and, since there was no possibility that the accused could have been convicted in the absence of the evidence, I would allow the appeal, quash the appellant's conviction and enter an acquittal in its place.

[115]The case at bar raises one such challenge. The appellant contends that the search of his computer breached his rights unders. 8of theCanadian Charterof Rights and Freedomsand that the evidence found on the computer should therefore be excluded and an acquittal entered on a charge of possession of child pornography (s. 163.1(4)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Before he was sentenced, however, Kindler escaped from prison and fled to Canada, where he was subsequently arrested and, after a hearing before Pinard J., committed for surrender, [1985] C.S. 1117. Ng is charged in the State of California with nineteen charges arising from multiple and brutal killings. On twelve of those charges, Ng, if found guilty, could receive the death penalty. He was arrested in Calgary following a bungled shoplifting attempt during which he shot and wounded a store security guard. At the end of a six-week hearing, Trussler J. committed Ng for extradition: (1988), 93 A.R. 204. Section 25 of theExtradition Actleaves the final decision to surrender with the Minister of Justice.

Shortly after midnight on April 3, 2005, 13-year-old Nina Courtepatte and her friend, Ms. K.B., were lured from West Edmonton Mall on the false promise of being taken to a party. The two young girls got into a car with five individuals: Mr. Laboucan, his co‐accused Michael Erin Briscoe, and three youths, Mr. M.W., Ms. S.B. and Ms. D.T. Mr. Briscoe drove the group to an isolated golf course. While they were walking down a gravel path and onto a fairway, Ms. S.B. hit Nina with a wrench, causing her to fall. Nina was then held down, sexually assaulted by Mr. Laboucan and Mr. M.W., and beaten to death. Nina's friend, Ms. K.B., was not assaulted. [4]All five individuals whom Nina and her friend joined that fateful night were charged with kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, and first degree murder. The two adults in the group, Mr. Laboucan and Mr. Briscoe, were jointly charged and tried together in this proceeding by a judge sitting without a jury. The three youths, Mr. M.W., Ms. S.B., and Ms. D.T., were charged separately. At the time of the joint trial, Mr. M.W. had pleaded guilty and was awaiting sentencing. The other youths were yet to be tried. Except for Mr. Briscoe, all charged individuals testified at the trial, as did Ms. K.B., giving various accounts of the tragic events. [5]During his testimony at trial, Mr. Laboucan admitted that he was present when the victim was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and murdered, but denied participating in any of those crimes. It was his position that the testimony of the other witnesses inculpating him had been fabricated for reasons of \"jealousy, a desire for revenge, or a desire to avoid responsibility for their own actions\" (trial judgment, at para. 201). [6]DNA and other forensic evidence was not conclusive insofar as it related to the two accused before the court. Credibility of the witnesses, including Mr. Laboucan, was, therefore, of central importance in the trial. [7]The trial judge provided lengthy and detailed reasons for judgment. In this appeal, we are concerned solely with the assessment of Mr. Laboucan's credibility and the role it played in arriving at a verdict of guilt. After outlining the approach set out inR. v.",

Because you wanted to pursue the argument. You were mad. You had raised your voice at him. He wanted to avoid and he went upstairs and you followed him and you kept arguing with him. Isn't that right? That would be fair to say. And then as he is upstairs, as you stated, or somewhat as you stated, you took the diploma.",

Would you say that this diploma was important to him? I'm sure it had some value to him. You took it, you looked at him, and you banged in on the floor. Uh-huh. [A.R., at p. 79] Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz said that she was standing on \"a little landing\" (A.R., at p. 60) measuring about 3 feet by 3 feet (A.R., at pp. 81-82). After she threw down the diploma, the appellant, she says, was upstairs and yelling and had \"raised his fist\" and Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz said to him, \"'Go ahead, hit me if you want to, Gary'. And he just went, 'Humph'\" (A.R., at p. 61) and she then went to a framed picture (also hanging on the landing wall) And I flicked the corner of it, and it fell down the stairs behind and smashed. Like, the glass smashed and the frame broke, and then i.e.afterMrs. Szczerbaniwicz had \"flicked\" down thesecondframed print Gary came charging down the stairs at me and just – I don't know how – I don't know how, if he grabbed me or how he did it, but he basically turned me around and pushed me up the stairs . . . [A.R., at p. 61] Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz acknowledged that her ongoing attack on his property \"was intentional on [her] part\" (A.R., at p. 81) and that when he came down the stairs, it seems, \"[t]here wasn't enough space\" for both people on the landing (A.R., at p. 81). [31]The military judge concluded from her evidence that she had suffered bruising on her back, legs and elbow but the fact that Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz had some bruises after falling on the staircase does not itself show that the force was excessive in the sense of disproportionate to what was \"necessary\". We were advised by counsel that some photographs were taken of Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz's bruises. The photographs were disclosed to the defence. Neither the prosecution nor the defence put the photographs in evidence at trial or sought to do so on appeal.",

He took an interest in then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's involvement with the Grand-Mère Golf Club located in Mr. Chrétien's home riding of St-Maurice, Quebec. His investigation led him to suspect Mr. Chrétien's involvement with a 1997 loan from the BDBC to the Auberge Grand-Mère, a hotel located next to the golf club, and with other federal grants in the riding. During his investigations, Mr. McIntosh contacted a person known to us only as X, but at that time X was unwilling to talk to Mr. McIntosh, even on a confidential basis. A.The Secret Source [9]However, in the Fall of 2000, another individual known only as Y contacted Mr. McIntosh and indicated that he or she had important information but would only disclose it in return for a promise of confidentiality. Mr. McIntosh was generally authorized by the then editor-in-chief of theNational Postto give promises of confidentiality and he routinely did so. The editor-in-chief testified that he considers himself a party to such promises of confidentiality. Indeed, the reviewing judge found that \"[a]ll of Mr. McIntosh's work was done with the support of the then Editor-in-Chief\" . [10]Mr. McIntosh testified that \"[t]he condition I agreed to in order to gain access to these materials was that I would . . . give a blanket, unconditional promise of confidentiality to protect the identity of both X and Y\" (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 156). [11]Y told Mr. McIntosh that he was acting on X's behalf and explained that X was willing to provide McIntosh with documents and information concerning the Auberge Grand-Mère loan. Based on materials received from Y, including what appeared to be copies of original documents from BDBC files and information received from other sources, Mr. McIntosh reported in theNational Postthat Mr. Chrétien had called the president of the BDBC and urged approval of the bank loan to Auberge Grand-Mère. When asked by reporters to comment, Mr. Chrétien acknowledged that the story was accurate. Numerous articles followed.

B.The Plain Brown Envelope [12]On April 5, 2001, Mr. McIntosh received a sealed plain brown envelope at the Ottawa Bureau of theNational Post. The envelope contained a document that appeared to be a copy of a BDBC internal loan authorization for a $615,000 mortgage to Les Entreprises Yvon Duhaime Inc. (Auberge Grand‐Mère) in August 1997. On the face of it, the document purported to show that, at the time it applied for and received the loan, Auberge Grand‐Mère listed an outstanding debt of $23,040 to \"JAC Consultants\", a Chrétien family investment company. Mr. McIntosh concluded that if the document were genuine, it would represent a major escalation in the Shawinigate story. [13]To check the authenticity of the document, Mr. McIntosh faxed copies to the BDBC, the Prime Minister's office, and to a lawyer for the Prime Minister. All three said that the document was a forgery. The BDBC sent two letters to theNational Poston April 6, 2001. The first claimed that the BDBC's records showed no indication of a debt owed to JAC Consultants. In the second letter, the BDBC warned theNational Postthat bank documents were confidential and should not be disclosed. A short time after receiving these letters, Mr. McIntosh put the document and its envelope somewhere, he claims, only he is able to access them. [14]The Bloc Quebecois also received a copy of the BDBC \"document\" which it photocopied and distributed to its members and others. The story was picked up by some news sources. The police believe, however, that only theNational Posthas an envelope and document that could disclose fingerprint or DNA evidence that might in turn lead to identification of the perpetrator(s) and provide physical evidence of the alleged crime(s). [15]Since it was unable to confirm the document's authenticity, theNational Posthesitated to publish the allegations. However, other news organizations published details about the leaked document and the reference to the alleged $23,040 loan and eventually theNational Postpicked up the story and reported that theGlobe and Mail, SunMedia and CTV had already published some details of the alleged bank document, as had theOttawa Citizen.",

X confirmed that it was he or she who had sent the envelope and asked that it be destroyed. X expressed concern that the police might try to use it to identify him or her through fingerprint or DNA analysis, and feared that the envelope might link him or her to the bank document now alleged to be a forgery. Mr. McIntosh testified that he told X \"that I would not dispose of them. I said this would be both improper and highly unethical given the serious allegation that the document had been forged\" (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 225). [17]However, as stated earlier, Mr. McIntosh also told X that so long as \"I believed that [X] had not provided the document to deliberately mislead me, my undertaking of confidentiality would remain binding. I also told Confidential Source X that should irrefutable evidence to the contrary emerge, our agreement of confidentiality would become null and void. X agreed to these terms\" (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 227). [18]Mr. McIntosh testified that X explained that he or she had received the document in the mail anonymously and had passed it on to Mr. McIntosh in the belief that it was genuine. On at least one other occasion, Mr. McIntosh had been able to confirm the authenticity of documents that X claimed to have received in the same way. In his evidence, Mr. McIntosh said he was satisfied that X was a reliable source and that the loan authorization was genuine. If the loan authorization was a forgery, Mr. McIntosh did not believe X knew that. D.The Police Investigation [19]In the meantime, the BDBC had complained to the RCMP about the alleged forgery. On June 7, 2001, RCMP Corporal Roland Gallant met with Mr. McIntosh, his editor-in-chief, another editor of theNational Post, and its legal counsel. Counsel for theNational Postrefused Corporal Gallant's request to produce the documents. The police officer was told that before becoming aware of the police investigation, Mr. McIntosh had placed the document and envelope in a secure location not onNational Postpremises.",

The police officer was told that before becoming aware of the police investigation, Mr. McIntosh had placed the document and envelope in a secure location not onNational Postpremises. Mr. McIntosh declined to identify the secret source. [20]Corporal Gallant indicated that he would have to apply for a search warrant and assistance order in relation to two offences — forgery (creation of a false document with the intent that it be acted upon as genuine) and uttering a forged document (attempting to cause Mr. McIntosh and theNational Postto act on the forged loan authorization as if it were genuine). TheNational Postexpressed \"grave concerns\" about the constitutionality of a warrant to disclose a confidential source and requested aninter parteshearing on the warrant application. E.The Search Warrant and Assistance Order [21]On July 4, 2002, Corporal Gallant applied to the Ontario Court of Justice for a warrant assistance order stating that the evidence he wished to seize was not available from any other source because the document and envelope formed part of theactus reusof these offences and would be required to substantiate any charges. He intended to submit the document and envelope for forensic testing to determine if they had \"fingerprints or other identifying markings which might assist in identifying the source of the document\". These other possible identifying markers included saliva, from which a DNA sample could be obtained. [22]Khawly J. was advised of the desire of theNational Postfor notice and a hearing but decided to proceedex parte. The search warrant and assistance order were issued without written reasons. The intended effect of the assistance order was to require the editor-in-chief of theNational Postto assist in locating the two documents in question and to make them available to Corporal Gallant. [23]In relation to procedural protection, the terms of the orders attempted to accommodate the special position of the media. It was provided that the orders were to be served on July 5, 2002. The appellants would thereafter be given a month to consider their position. On August 9, 2002 (or such earlier date as the appellants agreed to) Corporal Gallant was again to attend at the offices of theNational Postand request production of the BDBC loan authorization and the \"associated\" brown envelope.",

The warrant then provided that after waiting two hours (to give the appellants an opportunity for voluntary compliance without prejudice to any subsequent challenge they might see fit to make to the issuance or execution of the warrant) the police officer would then be free to search theNational Postpremises. The police were directed to interfere \"as little as possible with the operations of the place being searched and avoid, to the extent possible, examining any notes, documents, records or lists unconnected with securing the location of the things subject to seizure\". If found, the documents would on request be marked for identification and sealed in a package and delivered for safekeeping to the Ontario Court of Justice. The appellants would then have 14 days to apply \"for the continued sealing and return of any things sealed\". [24]The appellants duly applied to quash the warrant and assistance order. Relying upon a considerably amplified record which included the cross-examination of Mr. McIntosh and the filing of 15 affidavits from experienced journalists on the use and importance of secret sources, Benotto J., the reviewing judge, concluded that while there was \"sufficient information to conclude the document was a forgery\" , there was \"only a remote and speculative possibility that the fingerprints were those of the alleged forgerer\" and \"[d]isclosure of the document will minimally, if at all, advance the investigation while at the same time damage freedom of expression\" . Accordingly, she set aside the search warrant and assistance order. Her decision was reversed by the Ontario Court of Appeal on February 29, 2008 in reasons jointly authored by Justices Laskin and Simmons (2008 ONCA 139, 89 O.R. (3d) 1).

She was approximately 11 to 14 years old when the events complained of are alleged to have occurred, and 17 at the time of trial. [5]S.G.T. met the complainant's mother in 1995. The couple were married in 1996, and had a son, B, in 1997. S.G.T. subsequently adopted A. The couple separated in 2000, agreeing to a joint parenting arrangement according to which the two children would stay with their father two days a week, alternate weekends and one month during the summer. A stayed with her father under this arrangement until 2003 when she claimed she was uncomfortable staying at his place and would only go there if she was with her friends. A complained to her friend about her father's inappropriate sexual behaviour and eventually to her mother in the spring of 2003. Although A's mother contacted the police, she did not follow through when asked to call back, and nothing further was done about the situation at the time. [6]About a year later, in May 2004, A told her guidance counsellor at school about her father's actions and the police were called. A complained that S.G.T. touched her in a sexually inappropriate manner on three occasions during the time she spent at his home. These incidents form the subject matter of the charge against him. [7]S.G.T. agreed to be interviewed by the police on May 27, 2004. At the conclusion of the interview with the police, S.G.T. wrote out an apology to A on the police statement form. This apology was ruled inadmissible at trial, on the basis that the police officer had offered an inducement by implying that S.G.T. would not be charged if he apologized. More will be said later about the trial judge's findings on thevoir dire. [8]S.G.T. was charged with the offence of sexual assault on June 30, 2004. [9]By this time, A's mother had made arrangements to travel to California with A and B on July 6, 2004, to visit her parents. However, in order to travel with A and B, A's mother required, pursuant to their arrangement, S.G.T.'s consent. A's mother sent S.G.T. a number of e-mails in an effort to obtain his consent. He finally responded on July 5, 2004, with the following e-mail:",

In addition to the complainant's testimony, two items of evidence emanating from the accused figured prominently in the Crown's case: his confession to the police, which included the written apology to A; and the e-mail he sent to A's mother. [11]At the commencement of the trial, avoir direwas held regarding the statement to the police. The accused did not testify on thevoir dire. Based on the evidence adduced on thevoir dire, the trial judge held that \"the officer, on several occasions, left the impression to the accused that this was not a significant matter, that it was extremely minor, that the accused would not lose his job, that all that was necessary was an apology\" (Appellant's Record, at p. 68).",

    "text": "He concluded that the officer \"appears to imply that [the accused] may not be charged if he apologizes\", and \"[i]n so doing the officer held out hope of advantage to the accused\" (ibid.). The trial judge ruled the statement involuntary and, consequently, inadmissible. The evidence on thevoir direwas not admitted on the trial proper. [12]The Crown then called two witnesses: A and her mother. During the course of her testimony, the mother gave evidence about her e-mail correspondence with the accused, including his response on July 5, 2004. When asked by the trial judge whether the defence objected to the filing of the e-mails as an exhibit in the trial, counsel for S.G.T. responded \"No\". Nor was any objection raised concerning the mother's testimony about the July 5th e-mail. [13]S.G.T. testified in his defence. He denied sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. With respect to the apology in the e-mail, he explained that it had nothing to do with the allegations of sexual assault. His words of regret for any emotional pain he may have caused A were in reference, rather, to an incident when he had allowed the young complainant and some of her friends to share two alcoholic \"coolers\", an incident that had caused grief with some of the young girls' parents. [14]The contents of the e-mail ultimately played a crucial role in the trial judge's verdict against the accused. The trial judge disbelieved S.G.T.'s explanation. Since S.G.T. also spoke in the e-mail of the possibility of going to jail and never being able to coach his son or travel outside Canada, the \"only possible interpretation\" was that the e‐mail was \"a confession of guilt and one of remorse\" in respect of the sexual assaults, which, in turn, confirmed the testimony given by the complainant (2006 SKQB 234 (CanLII), at paras. 34-35). The trial judge convicted S.G.T. of sexual assault as charged. [15]On appeal from conviction and sentence before the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, S.G.T. raised several grounds, including that \"the learned trial judge erred in placing excessive weight on the evidence of [the e-mail] in finding [that he] had a 'guilty mind\"'. He also brought an application to introduce fresh evidence.",

Among other things, he stated in his affidavit filed in support of the application that he had lied about the e-mail at trial, and that he had given his evidence at the suggestion of his counsel. He explained that he included an apology in the e-mail because he had been told by the police in his interview \"that all that was needed to resolve the matter was a form of apology\" (Appellant's Record, at p. 103). He therefore hoped \"that the charge would not proceed as promised by the police\" (ibid.). In response to S.G.T.'s fresh evidence application, trial counsel filed an affidavit denying ever having \"suggested in any way, shape or form that [his] client tell anything but the absolute truth\" (ibid., at p. 112) and confirming that S.G.T.'s explanation for the e-mail had always been that offered in his testimony. [16]The Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to dispose of S.G.T.'s application to admit fresh evidence (2008 SKCA 119, 237 C.C.C. (3d) 55, at para. 109). It allowed the appeal against conviction on the sole ground that the trial judge had erred by failing to conduct avoir dire, on his own motion, to determine the admissibility of the e‐mail. The court was of the view that there were three \"exclusionary rules or limiting principles that might have been invoked to exclude the e-mail from evidence, or weaken, or neutralize its impact\": the confessions rule, provided that the mother could be brought within the characterization of a person in authority; the trial judge's inherent jurisdiction to exclude prejudicial evidence outweighing its probative value; and the derived confessions rule . While not faulting trial counsel or the trial judge for not anticipating \"every conceivable argument that hindsight and leisurely reflection can serve to devise or construct\", given these concerns about the e-mail and the \"decisive influence on the result\", the court saw no viable alternative other than setting aside the conviction and ordering a new trial .",

It is also important to remember that the decisions made by the police as to how to conduct the entry to the residence must be assessed in light of the information reasonably available to them at the time the decision was made. There is no question here that, had police known what they would in fact encounter in the residence, the approach would have been different. However, as the trial judge wisely observed, \"the [appellant] cannot attack the police decision on the basis of circumstances that were not reasonably known to the police\": A.R., vol. I, at p. 16. [5]The police obtained three search warrants on the morning of November 30, 2005. Two of the warrants related to dwelling houses and the third to a motor vehicle. The appellant was not and never had been a target of the investigation. Rather, the police were investigating what they believed to be \"dial-a-dope\" operation run by two members of a violent criminal gang. Based on surveillance and other evidence, the police thought that the appellant's residence was being used in that operation. This investigation was not about someone like the appellant who was previously unknown to police and who was keeping a little cocaine in his bedroom. The police nonetheless were entitled to draw reasonable inferences about the risks the search of the Cornell residence posed to them and in relation to the destruction of evidence from the activities and people involved. As I shall outline in a moment, the police had good reasons to believe based, among other things, on their surveillance of the premises, that the Cornell residence, which the appellant had given as his address, was being used in a drug dealing enterprise carried on by members of a violent criminal gang. They also had good reason to believe that the appellant himself was associated with at least one of these gang members who, through police surveillance of the Cornell residence, appeared to be welcome there.",

Attempts to consider the appellant in isolation from these facts are, in my respectful view, highly artificial. [6]In 2005, the Calgary police received information from a confidential informant that Henry Nguyen and Tuan Tran were running a \"dial‐a‐dope\" cocaine trafficking operation. They were believed by police to be members of an organized criminal group known as the \"Fresh Off the Boat\" gang. Police also believed that this gang, in the time leading up to the events in issue in this appeal, had been engaged in a violent war with another criminal gang that had resulted in a number of shootings and deaths. As one of the investigators said in his evidence at trial: . . . it was a real concern for police officers having to attend any residence that may be frequented by persons from these groups, in that they could pose a real threat to the police. We would not want them to react to our presence, take hostages, to fight the police to try to gain their escape, to try to fend off the police while the evidence was destroyed. So it became a very, very real security risk for the police officers that would be attending these residences. [A.R., vol. II, at p. 103] The trial judge accepted this evidence. [7]As mentioned, the police applied for, and obtained, search warrants for two residences which they believed were being used in the operation — the Tran residence and the Cornell residence — and, in addition, for a motor vehicle frequently used by Nguyen.",

In particular, the ITO stated that Nguyen had made brief visits to the appellant's residence on four occasions over a period of approximately two weeks. On the last visit, an unknown male accompanied Nguyen back to the vehicle for a short time and then returned to the residence. ·The Cornell residence was owned by Phuong Kim Thi Le and was occupied by Lorraine Cornell. ·Nguyen had been taken into custody two months before the search and released. A mobile phone registered to the appellant as subscriber was found in the car Nguyen was driving at that time. The subscriber information for the telephone showed the appellant's address as the Cornell residence. The appellant had also given the address of the Cornell residence when he had been involved in a car accident about five months earlier. ·The tactical team would be required to enter the residence in order to avoid the destruction of evidence by potential occupants and for the safety of both the public and the police because of Nguyen and Tran's history of violence and association with the organized crime group \"Fresh Off the Boat\". [8]A judge of the Alberta Provincial Court authorized warrants to search the Cornell residence as well as the other residence believed to be Tran's and a motor vehicle operated by Nguyen. The Cornell residence was placed under surveillance from the morning of November 30, 2005, until the search warrant was executed shortly before 6:00 that evening. [9]The situation was complicated by the fact that the police felt that it was important to execute the three warrants as closely in time as possible.",

A tactical team was to be used at both residences and in the stop of the vehicle. Its job was to secure the site and then turn it over to the investigators who would conduct the search. [10]At the Cornell residence, the tactical team conducted an unannounced hard entry, sometimes referred to as a \"dynamic entry\", by nine police officers with weapons drawn and wearing balaclavas and body armour. Entry involved battering the front door and entering the house while yelling \"Police, search warrant\". The only person in the house at the time was the appellant's brother, who was 29 years old and mentally challenged. He was taken down and handcuffed with his hands behind his back. His emotional distress became quickly apparent and the officer dealing with him removed the handcuffs, took off his balaclava, called the accompanying paramedic to assist and facilitated a call by the man to his mother Lorraine. According to the evidence, from the time of entry to the time that this individual was out of the handcuffs and seated on a couch being comforted by one of the officers was about four minutes: C.A., at para. 40,perSlatter J.A. As noted by Slatter J.A. in the Court of Appeal, there was some damage to the premises during the entry, but Ms. Cornell testified that she was able to repair it with material she had around the house without incurring any expense: C.A., at para. 31. [11]The tactical team did not have the warrant with them when they entered the house. Detective Bent, who was in charge of the investigation and of the search that started as soon as the house was secured by the tactical team, had a copy of the warrant. He entered the residence approximately four minutes after the tactical team went in.",

    "text": "[4]On arriving in Canada in 2001, the appellants, who are a couple, applied for refugee status for themselves and their children, alleging that acts of violence had been committed against them in their country of origin, Hungary. Their application was based on three incidents between 1997 and 2001 in which the male appellant, together on one occasion with the female appellant, was attacked by Hungarian citizens because of their Gypsy ethnic origin.The appellants and their children were granted refugee status and became permanent residents. [5]Some two years later, Hungary issued an international arrest warrant in respect of a charge of fraud that had been laid against the appellants.The Hungarian authorities allege that in early November 2000, the couple sold the right of lease for premises in Budapest for approximately C$2,700, despite the fact that they did not possess the right to lease the flat. [6]The Minister sought an order from the Superior Court of Quebec for the appellants' committal on the Canadian offence of fraud contrary tos. 380(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which corresponds to the conduct alleged against them in Hungary. The committal order was granted and has not been appealed. [7]The Minister then ordered their surrender. In reaching his decision, he considered the principle ofnon-refoulement, but concluded it did not stand in the way of ordering the appellants' surrender. The Minister noted first that there is an exception tonon-refoulementwith respect to persons who are accused of a serious non-political offence which he noted was defined in the immigration context to be an offence punishable by imprisonment of 10 years or more. Fraud, he noted, is such a crime. He did not, however, address the appellants' contention that, given the amount of the alleged deprivation, the offences alleged against them would not attract a punishment of 10 years in Canada. The Minister then turned to the issue of risk of persecution. He stated his view that persons challenging their surrender on the basis that they will be persecuted in the requesting state must establish two things on the balance of probabilities: that the persecution would sufficiently shock the conscience or be fundamentally unacceptable to Canadian societyandthat they will in fact be subjected to this persecution.",

To assist his consideration of risk the appellants would face if returned to Hungary, the Minister sought and received the views of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. The advice was to the effect that, following Hungary's accession to the European Union in 2004, there was no serious possibility that the appellants would be subjected in Hungary to persecution on the basis of their Roma origin. [8]The appellants sought judicial review of this decision in the Quebec Court of Appeal. Doyon J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal, dismissed the joint application for judicial review. In his view, the respondent had jurisdiction to order the surrender of the appellants after having consulted with the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (\"MCI\") about this. Doyon J.A. also concluded that the respondent's decision was reasonable: [translation] He could reasonably conclude that the situation in Hungary is such that extradition of the applicants is not oppressive or unjust, does not shock the conscience of Canadians, and is not unacceptable. The opinion of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration authorized him to conclude that the situation in Hungary has changed since the applicants' departure. Hungary's accession to the European Union in May 2004 is proof that the country has satisfied certain criteria with regard to the stability of its democratic institutions, the rule of law, human rights, and the respect and protection of minorities; it has also had to harmonize its laws and institutions with those of the European Union. The detailed risk analysis sent by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration permits the assertion that the respondent could reasonably conclude that there is no longer a risk of persecution in Hungary on the basis of racial origin and that these changes indicate that the situation there is completely different from the situation there about a decade ago.

Pursuant to Mr. Libman's directions the sales personnel telephoned United States residents and attempted to induce them to purchase shares in two companies, Hebilla Mining Corporation and Claravella Corporation, which purported to be engaged in gold mining in Costa Rica. In addition to the telephone representations, the United States residents also received promotional material which was mailed from Panama City, Panama and San José, Costa Rica by associates of Mr. Libman. 4.The telephone sales personnel, on the direction of Mr. Libman, made material misrepresentations with respect to their identity, where they were telephoning from, and the quality and value of the shares they were selling. As a result of these misrepresentations, a large number of United States residents were induced to purchase shares in the two mining companies. There was some evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry from which it could be inferred that these shares were virtually worthless. 5.The United States residents who agreed to purchase shares were told by the telephone sales personnel to send their money to offices operated by Mr. Libman's associates in either San José, Costa Rica or Panama City, Panama. There was evidence tendered that Mr. Libman went to a location outside Canada, usually Costa Rica or Panama, to meet with his associates and receive his share of the proceeds of the sale of the shares. Mr. Libman then brought this money back to Toronto and distributed a portion of it to his sales personnel. There was also evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry with respect to the wire transfer of monies from Panama City to Mr. Libman in Toronto.",

The Immigration and Refugee Board (\"IRB\") allowed the appellant's claim for refugee protection. [3]The Romanian authorities later requested that he be extradited to serve a prison sentence on a conviction for forging visas. The appellant had allegedly been convicted in Romania for participating in the forging of Schengen visas for two persons in exchange for US$1,800. The appellant did not reveal in his refugee claim that he was wanted by the Romanian police or that he had been convicted of forging visas. He had not appeared at his trial or at the hearing of his appeal, even though he was still residing in Romania at the time. He had therefore been convictedin absentia.

Between his arrival in Canada and the time he was taken into custody pursuant to an order made under theExtradition Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18(\"EA\"), the appellant was convicted of several indictable offences, including theft, fraud, possession and use of forged documents (credit card), obstruction of a peace officer, possession of break-in instruments, and conspiracy. [6]In May 2006, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada applied to the IRB to vacate the decision to allow the appellant's claim for refugee protection.

In its decision, the IRB found that the INTERPOL notice seemed to have been fabricated, as it was unlikely that INTERPOL would issue a wanted notice without fingerprints for a person who has allegedly been arrested, tried and convicted. [7]The Quebec Superior Court ordered that the appellant be committed into custody to await his extradition. The appellant contested his extradition, alleging,inter alia, that he was at risk of being mistreated and that he would be unable to have the verdict and the sentence reviewed. On July 2, 2008, the Minister of Justice (\"Minister\") ordered that the appellant be extradited to his country of origin to serve his prison sentence.

The Minister stated that Romania had joined the European Union and therefore had to meet that organization's requirements regarding, in particular, the rule of law as well as respect for, and the protection of, minorities. The fact that it had become a member of the European Union also meant that its citizens are now afforded the protection and guarantees of theConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 213 U.N.T.S. 221. The Minister concluded that the appellant had not satisfied him that his surrender would be unjust, oppressive or contrary to theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Minister expressed the view that granting refugee status does not preclude extraditing a person if doing so is otherwise justified.

C-34 (now s. 207(3)). In particular, they were accused of counselling the breaking of the so-called 15%-20% rule (a maximum of 15% of the revenues can go to management costs and a minimum of 20% of the revenues must go to the charity). The terms and conditions for such lotteries are set out in Order-in-Council 2797/82 and other rules, regulations and directions issued by the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations of Ontario. The allegation was that the substantive offence of breaching the terms and conditions of the licences was an offence under s. 190(3) of theCodeand that, therefore, s. 22 applied (counselling an offence). The appellants challenged the provisions of ss. 190(1)(b) and 190(2) (now ss. 207(1)(b) and 207(2)). They submitted that Parliament exceeded its powers of delegation in permitting exemptions from criminality for charitable or religious organizations operating a lottery pursuant to a licence issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of a province. They further argued that, even if there were a proper delegation of power to the provincial authority, Order-in-Council 2797/82 was not passed in accordance with provincial legislation and that the order, together with the other rules and directions, were not published and, therefore, did not create an offence known to law. Finally, they contended that the legislative scheme set out in ss. 190(1)(b) and 190(2) violateds. 15of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsby reason of the unequal effect of those provisions throughout the country. The trial judge, finding that the provisions of theCodepurporting to delegate power to the Lieutenant Governor in Council wereultra viresParliament as an improper delegation of criminal law, dismissed the charges against the appellants.

He was carrying and showing off a Glock firearm. The victim, Lee Matasi, was shot and killed after a scuffle outside a nightclub. Earlier that evening, Mr. Matasi had been drinking in Gastown with some friends. On his way home, he encountered the appellant on the street outside another club. As stated, they were unknown to each other. [147]According to the appellant's ex-girlfriend, he was being loud, he was \"in the party mode\", and according to another witness he seemed \"very aggravated\". At one point, the appellant lifted up his shirt to show some people he had a gun. Other witnesses heard someone question whether the gun was real, and watched as the appellant shot at a building to prove that it was, saying \"It's not real, right\", in a sarcastic voice. [148]During this exchange, Mr. Matasi volunteered the comment that said, \"It's not cool shooting a gun\". Mr. Matasi and his friends were intoxicated. One witness heard them yell something to the effect of: \"Why don't you shoot the gun again?\" or \"Shoot the window out\". Another said they yelled \"Smash the window, smash that truck\". The appellant yelled back at Mr. Matasi's group and went up the hill in their direction. When the appellant reached the Matasi group he picked a fight with Mr. Matasi. A scuffle ensued. At one point the gun went off. It came loose on the ground but was recovered by the appellant. The struggle continued. [149]At this point accounts diverge. Some witnesses said that before the second — fatal — shot went off, both men were standing grappling with each other. However, the Crown's main witness, who had not been drinking, described seeing a person he identified as the appellant holding up another man who had his rear end on the ground, and had his legs splayed out in front of him. The appellant was standing uphill from the first, was holding the other up by the scruff of his neck, and was in a fit of rage. He was pointing a firearm down at the other man.

Mr. Matasi died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. [150]After the shot was fired, the appellant immediately fled the scene, and ran into an alley. The police watched as he deposited something into a dumpster. The appellant was arrested, and a Glock firearm was retrieved from amongst the rubbish. At trial, he did not testify. Crown counsel in his closing submissions stated to the jury that they could draw an inference from the appellant's \"immediate flight\" after the shooting that the appellant was guilty of murder. The Crown submitted that the appellant's lack of hesitation before fleeing indicated that he acted with an intent to kill. The permissible use of evidence of the post-gunshot demeanour and flight of the appellant forms the subject matter of the appeal.

At trial, K.D. estimated that she was unconscious for \"less than three minutes\". She testified that she consented to J.A. choking her, and understood that she might lose consciousness. She stated that she and J.A. had experimented with erotic asphyxiation, and that she had lost consciousness before. [6]When K.D. regained consciousness, she was on her knees at the edge of the bed with her hands tied behind her back, and J.A. was inserting a dildo into her anus. K.D. gave conflicting testimony about whether this was the first time J.A. had inserted a dildo into her anus. During her examination in chief, she stated that this was a first, and initially maintained this answer during cross-examination by defence counsel: [Mr. Goldstein]: In terms of having what you referred to as a dildo inserted -- you had said in your butt, is that something that had happened before? [K.D.]: No, we hadn't done that. We discussed the possibility of it. At the moment I just went with it in the spirit of experimentation. [7]However, when confronted with the transcript of her testimony at J.A.'s bail hearing, K.D. changed her answer: [K.D.]: . . . we had tried it one time prior. [Mr. Goldstein]: Okay. . . . [K.D.]: Somewhat of a drunken evening a while ago. I do apologize. [8]K.D. testified that J.A. removed the dildo ten seconds after she regained consciousness. The two then had vaginal intercourse. When they had finished, J.A. cut K.D.'s hands loose. [9]K.D. made a complaint to the police on July 11.",

She was 17 at the time of both incidents; he was 22 at the time of the first and 23 at the time of the second. The trial judge found that the two incidents described by the complainant had occurred. The main issue, in his view, was whether the sexual activity had been proved to be without the complainant's consent ). [3]The judge found that the appellant had \"adopted a lifestyle\" that included regular parties at his home and providing young women — including the complainant and her 15-year-old sister — with alcohol . [4]The first incident described by the complainant occurred in February 2006. The complainant and appellant were socializing in his apartment, including drinking alcohol that he had provided. The complainant's younger sister as well as the appellant's roommate and another friend were also present, but the friend left before the others went to sleep. At the end of the evening, the complainant's sister went to sleep on the couch, the roommate went to sleep in his room and the appellant and complainant went to sleep in the appellant's bed. The complainant testified her sleeping in the appellant's bed had not been discussed beforehand. [5]The complainant testified that in the early hours of the morning, the appellant moved closer to her and began grabbing and touching her. She testified that she said \"stop\" but that he eventually had unprotected intercourse with her. She got up, cleaned herself off, walked around the house and returned to bed with the appellant, although she did not sleep. Later in the morning, she got up, woke up her sister and they left. She did not mention the incident, and her sister testified that nothing seemed amiss. The complainant's sister, however, testified that when she woke up on this occasion, the complainant was in the appellant's bedroom. When questioned about this apparent inconsistency between her evidence and that of the complainant, her sister responded that she could be confusing it with a different time when they were at the appellant's house.

Once again, she testified that he began touching and kissing her, and that she said \"no\" before they had unprotected intercourse. Afterwards, she was \"too on edge\" to leave the apartment, despite having a car, so she returned to the same bed and went to sleep. She left the next day and did not tell anyone about the occurrence. [7]The complainant posted a poem online. The judge found that it had been written very soon after the February 2006 incident \"as an outlet\" . Her sister saw the poem on the Internet and the incidents came to light when she began to discuss it with the complainant. The complainant filed a police report, and the appellant was charged with two counts of sexual assault. At trial, the appellant testified and denied any sexual contact with the complainant. [8]The trial judge acquitted the appellant on both counts. After summarizing virtually all of the evidence the trial judge found that he had \"absolutely no doubt\" that sexual intercourse had taken place between the appellant and complainant; he specifically rejected the appellant's denials in this regard . [9]However, the trial judge acknowledged that he also had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual activity had occurred without the complainant's consent. He noted some \"concerns\" in this regard. He referred to the sister's evidence that she might have been confused between the times that she saw the complainant in the appellant's bed. The judge said that this caused him to wonder how many times the complainant had ended up in the appellant's bed. He asked himself \"why did [the complainant] insist in going back to the same bed that she had been violated in?\" . The judge then noted that he suspected \"very strongly\" that the complainant was confused and that she \"wrestled\" with going into the accused's bedroom.

[10]The trial judge referred to the poem the complainant had written, entitled \"Black Dark\", and quoted it in its entirety in his oral reasons. As noted, he accepted both that it was written very shortly after the February incident, and that it had been written as an outlet. He then stated, \"[w]hen I read [the complainant's] description of the incidents on February 11th, concerns are raised\" . He noted that the words \"bittersweet\" and \"regret\" which she had used in the poem were \"[h]ardly the words that describe a rape\" . The trial judge then concluded that \"[i]n all of the circumstances of this case, notwithstanding that I do not believe the accused, notwithstanding that I am satisfied that sexual intercourse did occur on both of these occasions, I cannot be satisfied that [the complainant] was sexually assaulted without her consent\" . [11]The Crown appealed successfully to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial on both counts of the indictment (2009 ONCA 834, 256 O.A.C. 246). The court concluded that the trial judge erred in law in his approach to the evidence. Specifically, it found that he failed to consider some lines of the poem in the context of the others, and that he failed to consider the poem in the context of the complainant's testimony on consent. This, according to Watt J.A., was a \"piecemeal\" approach which was incompatible with the trial judge's obligations to consider the cumulative effect of all relevant evidence and constituted an error of law as set out in this Court's decision inR. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57. [12]The appellant argues that the trial judge did not approach the evidence in a \"piecemeal\" fashion. The appellant further argues that even if the trial judge did err as the Court of Appeal suggested, the Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction to entertain a Crown appeal because any error was an error of fact and not an error of law alone as is required bys. 676(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.",

Of the 628 images, 616 were \"accessible\", defined at trial as \"ones which can be located by any computer user with a minimum of effort\" (Agreed Statement of Facts (A.R., at p. 183)). All of these materials showed the actual abuse of real children, including babies. Some of the images depicted children engaging in sexual activity with adults and other children, while others showed children exposing their genitals, and being anally and vaginally penetrated. [16]At trial, Mr. Katigbak admitted that all of the images of children constituted child pornography within the meaning ofs. 163.1(1)of theCriminal Code, and that he had collected them between 1999 and 2006. However, he contended that he only collected child pornography because he intended to create an artistic exhibition exploring the sexual exploitation of children. As such, he argued that he was entitled to rely on the defence in s. 163.1(6) for artistic expression. He explained that his artistic project would not include any images of actual child pornography, but rather that he would try to convey the psychological effect of child abuse by using mannequins and dolls. [17]Mr. Katigbak stated at trial that he collected child pornography to research what child pornography looked like and then explore his emotional responses to it. He explained that he knew that viewing images would invoke an \"extreme sense of anger\" and that he wanted \"those feelings to be fresh\" when he was working on the project (A.R., at p. 93). [18]Investigators also found a large collection of adult pornography intermingled with the images of child pornography on Mr. Katigbak's computer. When asked in cross-examination, Mr. Katigbak stated that the images of adult pornography found in his possession were not related to the proposed art project but for \"personal entertainment\" (A.R., at p. 113). He admitted to making no effort to isolate the child pornography from the adult images on his computer. He also took no steps to add safeguards on the computer, such as adding password protections to the child pornography files.",

On a daily basis, this included his father and brother, and occasionally at parties, up to 30 or 40 people. [19]Mr. Katigbak testified that he conceived of this art project on child pornography while he was completing a Bachelor's degree in psychology at McMaster University. As evidence, he introduced his notebooks from 2000, 2001 and 2003 in which he wrote about how such an exhibit could be created. In one such entry, Mr. Katigbak wrote: \"[H]ow do you do a show on child porn? (you can't show it) — maybe do a documentary? . . . models should show a broken spirit, fear, helplessness — show a child w/ an adult in the background (looming or doing-up his pants after the abuse has occurred)\" (A.R., at p. 239). [20]Mr. Katigbak also spent a number of years working in the photography industry, and testified that he hoped his exhibit on child pornography would draw attention to his work. One of his colleagues from Japan Camera Centre, Stacey Tyrell, testified that she and Mr. Katigbak discussed various ideas for artistic projects. She testified that, in early 2004, the two talked about using child mannequins in an artistic project after they saw a store window that displayed undressed child mannequins. Mr. Katigbak never specifically spoke to her about a project relating to the sexual abuse of children, but she stated that this was one of the themes that they discussed. He never told her that he was collecting child pornography as part of an art project. [21]By the time Mr. Katigbak was charged with possession of child pornography in 2006, seven years had passed since he had started collecting the materials.

    "text": "[7]In March 2005, Sgt. Kevin Brezinski of the Edmonton drug squad obtained and executed a search warrant at the home of Irfan Qureshi based in part on the information provided by a confidential police informer. The police seized 1.5 kg each of methamphetamine and cocaine, three handguns, a bulletproof vest and paraphernalia for cooking and packaging cocaine. In the same month a second search netted a seizure of 4 kg of cocaine, 6 oz. of methamphetamine, a handgun, and $55,000. Qureshi and others were charged with a number of drug trafficking and firearms offences. [8]Defence counsel retained the appellant Ross Barros, a private investigator, to look into the strengths and weaknesses of the Crown's case. Mr. Barros is a retired police officer with 25 years of experience with the Edmonton police service, seven of which were engaged in investigating drug crimes. [9]Mr. Barros decided to take steps to discover the informer's identity. According to the theory of the prosecution, he met with Qureshi's associates, told them he was working for the defence and was going to find out who had informed on Qureshi. He demanded the associates' cell phone numbers to see if any of them had been in touch with the investigating officer, Sgt. Brezinski. Mr. Barros warned them that the informer in their midst should seek legal advice and contact him so that they could \"work this thing together\". [10]Mr. Barros obtained the associates' call records from sources unknown. He also compared the criminal record of each of the associates against the disclosed criminal record of the informer to eliminate potential candidates. He helped identify a polygraph operator, and suggested that those of Qureshi's associates who had not provided their cell phone numbers should instead participate in a polygraph test. He later began approaching individuals, telling each that he \"knew\" that person was the informer. [11]Mirza Kassam, the only one of the associates to testify at trial, said he arrived late at the initial meeting in which Mr. Barros requested the associates' phone numbers. He left his name and number on a piece of Mr. Barros's letterhead. After Kassam missed a subsequent meeting, he was instructed to call Mr. Barros, whom he later met in a parking lot.

Kassam says he denied the accusation but was afraid of falling under suspicion because \"out there, informants get killed\". Mr. Barros demanded Kassam's cell phone records. Kassam said he felt that if he did not comply, Mr. Barros would conclude that he was the informer. Kassam testified to his belief that Mr. Barros wanted him to confess so that Mr. Barros could put it to the police that he knew who their source was and get the charges dropped. Kassam said that after this meeting, despite his denial, the other associates became very hostile towards him and he feared that he might be killed. (The trial judge found this evidence to be wholly unreliable.) [12]Mr. Barros eventually arranged a meeting with Sgt. Brezinski for May 6, 2005, at a local golf course. Krewenchuk was also present at this meeting. Qureshi had a bail hearing scheduled for the same date. Brezinski had already recommended bail for Qureshi on strict conditions. Mr.Barros advised Sgt. Brezinski (up until that time a personal friend) that he knew the identity of the informer but that he had not revealed this information to Qureshi. Nor was he going to advise his retaining counsel of the informer's identity \"at this time\". [13]Mr. Barros told Sgt. Brezinski and Sgt. Krewenchuk of several cases Mr. Barros recalled from his time on the Edmonton police force where the charges against an accused were dropped in order to protect the informer once the identity of an informer was discovered. Mr. Barros said that although he had not told anyone about the informer's identity, he would eventually have to report it to defence counsel. Brezinski testified that he understood Mr. Barros to be asking him to drop the charges against Qureshi if he didn't want the identity of the informer to be revealed. Brezinski told Mr. Barros that he was committing extortion and obstruction of justice. [14]Mr. Barros was charged with one count of obstructing justice for taking investigative steps to identify a confidential police source \"for the purpose of interfering with criminal proceedings\" against Irfan Qureshi.

[15]In a cautioned statement to police on May 13, 2005, following his arrest, Mr. Barros said that he knew the identity of the informer and was aware that the person thus identified would be in danger if this were disclosed, even if his \"identification\" turned out to be mistaken.

One of the respondents was overheard to say[translation]\"You're going to die tonight\". Sarrazin and Jean then left. They returned five minutes later. Sarrazin had armed himself with a sawed-off shotgun. After another brief verbal scuffle, Sarrazin pointed the weapon at Noël and fired the shotgun just as Noël reached out for it, shooting him in the forearm. As Jean and another person urged him to kill Noël, Sarrazin discharged the barrel into Noël's abdomen and fled. Noël collapsed and was rushed to hospital. The gunshot wound to his abdomen caused life-threatening injuries, particularly to his liver. Skilful surgical intervention and medical care saved his life, at least for a short time. [5]Although Noël's post-operative progress was somewhat uneven, by March 13, 1998, he was doing well enough to be released from the hospital. Dr. Joel Freeman, his surgeon, expected that Noël would make a full recovery. Five days later, for reasons that are not entirely clear, he suddenly collapsed and died of a pulmonary thromboembolism (blood clot) that blocked the flow of blood to his lungs. Dr. Freeman described the death as a \"freakish\" medical happening. In the autopsy, trace amounts of cocaine were detected in Noël's blood. This presence of the drug indicated cocaine consumption within 30 to 45 minutes of death. [6]Expert testimony indicated that the blood clot was probably related to the injuries sustained in the shooting, but, given that cocaine could cause hypercoagulability (propensity to develop blood clots), the pathologist called by the Crown refused at trial to rule out the possibility that the clot wasentirelythe result of the victim's consumption of cocaine.

    "text": "[4]The relevant facts of this case are not in dispute. For the purposes of this appeal, it will suffice to mention that the appellant, Tommy Bouchard‐Lebrun, and a long‐time acquaintance of his, Yohann Schmouth, had smoked marijuana and taken amphetamines during the day on October 23, 2005. In the evening, they decided to go to Amqui so the appellant could visit his parents. They took the bus from Rivière‐du‐Loup, where the appellant lived, to the last stop in Mont‐Joli. They were still intoxicated when they got on the bus. [5]When they arrived in Mont‐Joli during the night on October 24, the appellant and his friend decided to hitchhike to Amqui. At about 1:30 a.m., Gilles Tremblay, an old acquaintance of the appellant's family, picked them up in his car. At that time, no signs of intoxication were apparent from the appellant's behaviour. At trial, Mr. Tremblay stated that he had not noticed anything unusual about the appellant at any time during the car trip. His statements confirmed Mr. Schmouth's testimony that the appellant was [translation] \"OK\" again when they were around Val‐Brillant, a municipality about 15 kilometres from Amqui. Therefore, it seems that the drugs taken by the appellant during the day on October 23 had ceased to have effect before he arrived in Amqui with Mr. Schmouth. [6]In Amqui, the two young men purchased ecstasy pills of a type known as \"poire bleue\", which they took during the night on October 24. During the hours that followed, the appellant and Mr. Schmouth decided to go and beat up Dany Lévesque, who was known as \"Pee‐Wee\", for the real or imagined reason that he wore an [translation] \"upside‐down cross\" around his neck. Around 5:00 a.m., the appellant and Mr. Schmouth illegally entered the building where Mr. Lévesque lived. Roger Dumas, who lived on the second floor of the building, was woken up by noise coming from the ground floor and went down to Mr. Lévesque's apartment to find out what was going on. The two occupants of the building met in the stairs and realized that the appellant and Mr. Schmouth were there, and the latter two then brutally attacked Mr. Lévesque by punching and kicking him many times. [7]Mr. Dumas saw that Mr. Lévesque could not defend himself against his two attackers and tried to intervene.",

    "text": "The appellant grabbed him and threw him violently down the stairs. Mr. Dumas lay on the floor at the bottom of the stairs. The appellant went down to where he was and stomped on his head. The assault left Mr. Dumas disabled, and he will have to spend the rest of his life in a hospital. [8]At the time of the assault, the appellant was highly intoxicated because of the effects of the \"poire bleue\" pill he had taken a few hours earlier. In addition to the \"normal\" symptoms of intoxication resulting from the use of that drug, the highly toxic pill had produced a striking and, according to the appellant, unanticipated effect on him, as it caused a complete dissociation between the appellant's subjective perceptions and the objective reality. To put it bluntly, he was [translation] \"on another planet\". Two witnesses at the trial stated that he [translation] \"started acting weird\" and was \"completely out of it\" after taking the \"poire bleue\" pill. [9]In actual fact, the appellant experienced an episode that might be described as religious delirium in light of its symptoms. It was after taking the drug that he became obsessed with the \"upside‐down cross\" supposedly worn by Mr. Lévesque. During the attack, he made statements of a religious nature that, although coherent, were basically absurd. For example, he said that the Apocalypse was coming. At one point, he raised his arms in the air and asked the victims and the helpless witnesses to the attack whether they believed in him. After referring a few times to God and the Devil once the attack was over, he blessed Mr. Dumas's spouse by making the sign of the cross on her forehead. Mr. Dumas was still lying on the floor when the appellant then left the scene very calmly as if nothing had just happened. [10]It has never been in dispute, in any of the courts, that the appellant was in a serious psychotic condition at the time of the offences and that the effects of that condition diminished gradually until they disappeared on October 28, 2005. The essential issue in this appeal is instead how that psychosis affects the appellant's criminal responsibility. I will consider this issue later in these reasons.",

He had no underlying disease of the mind, nor was he addicted to a particular substance.

    "text": "On December 4, 1987, an R.C.M.P. officer observed a person whom he believed to be the respondent (Mr. Grant) driving a motor vehicle in the city of Charlottetown and pursued him, believing him to be driving while disqualified. The officer followed the car, and caught up with Mr. Grant, who was apparently, at that time, standing on the sidewalk approximately 300 feet from his vehicle. The officer then asked Mr. Grant to enter the police car for questioning. During the conversation in the police car, the officer smelt alcohol on Mr. Grant's breath, which caused him to suspect that he had been operating a motor vehicle with alcohol in his body. The officer thereupon decided to make a demand under s. 238(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 254(2)), that Mr. Grant submit to an A.L.E.R.T. test. However, the officer did not have the necessary apparatus with him at the time so he had another officer deliver it to him. The apparatus did not arrive for another 30 minutes, during which time Mr. Grant remained in the police car. Mr. Grant did not take the test and the officer charged him with failing or refusing to comply with his demand contrary to s. 238(5) of theCode(now s. 254(5)). Mr. Grant was also charged with operating a motor vehicle while disqualified contrary to s. 242(4)(b) (now s. 259(4)(b)) of theCode. At no point during the 30 minutes during which Mr. Grant was in the company of the police officer was he informed of his right to counsel unders. 10(b)of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. At trial in the Prince Edward Island Provincial Court, counsel for Mr. Grant moved, unders. 24(2)of theCharter, for the exclusion of evidence of statements made by Mr. Grant to the police officer, including his refusal or failure to comply with the demand to provide a breath sample, on the basis that Mr. Grant's s. 10(b) rights had been infringed. Thompson C. Ct. J. found that there had been an infringement of s. 10(b) and excluded the evidence relating to the statements made by Mr. Grant, pursuant tos. 24(2)of theCharter.He then entered an acquittal on the charge of refusing to comply with a request for a breath sample for lack of evidence.

He suffered a tragic upbringing, which saw the death of his alcoholic mother when he was a child and the development of his own serious alcohol addiction by the time he was 12 years old. His life is marked by an ever-present alcohol addiction coupled with a propensity to inflict brutal violence on those with whom he comes into contact while intoxicated. [103]From the age of 12 to 18, he accumulated a record of 36 convictions, mostly property-related. As an adult, Mr. Ipeelee continued to commit property offences, but added to them a series of increasingly violent crimes. The series of violent offences began in September 1992, when he was 19. On this occasion, he attacked a man with an ashtray and chair when he was refused entry into the victim's home. He pled guilty to assault causing bodily harm and was sentenced to 21 days' imprisonment followed by one year's probation. [104]In August 1993, he committed a second assault causing bodily harm when, while on probation for the prior offence, he beat an individual unconscious outside a bar in Iqaluit, kicking him in the face at least 10 times and continuing the assault after the individual had lost consciousness. This attack left the victim hospitalized. Less than one year later he pled guilty to yet another aggravated assault. This time the victim was hospitalized after being beaten to unconsciousness by Mr. Ipeelee, who then continued to stomp on his face. Mr. Ipeelee was sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment for the August 1993 offence and 14 months for the subsequent offence. [105]Three weeks after receiving early release from prison for this attack, he committed a sexual assault in which he and another man raped a woman who had passed out from intoxication at a party. He pled guilty and received a sentence of two years in prison. A consecutive eight-month sentence was added for his escape from prison two days before the plea and sentencing hearing.",

In the six months after his release for this offence, he was arrested at least nine times for public intoxication. [106]In August 1999, he committed a sexual assault causing bodily harm when he raped a homeless woman, during the course of which he threatened to kill her, and punched her repeatedly in the face. The woman required treatment in hospital for her injuries. It was this crime that led to his designation as a long-term offender. At the hearing the sentencing judge noted ): This summary of Mr. Ipeelee's crimes of violence shows a consistent pattern of Mr. Ipeelee administering gratuitous violence against vulnerable, helpless people while he is in a state of intoxication. [para. 34] Mr. Ipeelee was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for this offence to be followed by a 10-year LTSO. [107]The offence that led to this appeal occurred in August 2008 after Mr. Ipeelee had been on release for 17 months. On this occasion, police found Mr. Ipeelee intoxicated in downtown Kingston and he was charged with breaching the abstention from intoxicants condition of his LTSO. He pled guilty on November 14, 2008, and received a sentence of three years in prison.

He was born in 1962 and, like Mr. Ipeelee, suffered a tragic childhood, with both alcoholic parents dying while he was quite young. At the age of five, he was sent to a residential school and on his return, he lived with his grandparents. It was then, at the age of nine, that he began drinking. He has continued to have serious problems with alcohol and drugs throughout his life, with the exception of a six-year period of sobriety in the 1990s, a time when he was also free of convictions. [109]Mr. Ladue has a criminal record of 40 convictions. It includes a lengthy list of property and impaired driving offences. He has two convictions for robbery, and two convictions for common assault. His most serious convictions stem from a series of sexual assaults.",

His most serious convictions stem from a series of sexual assaults. The first occurred in 1987 when he sexually assaulted an unconscious woman at a party. In 1998, he was convicted of breaking and entering. During the break and enter, he placed a sleeping bag over a sleeping woman's head and shoulders, but fled when her daughter interrupted him. Although he was not convicted of sexual assault, the sentencing judge at Mr. Ladue's 2003 hearing, where he was designated a long-term offender, found the incident \"eerily similar\" to the previous sexual assaults (2003 YKTC 100 (CanLII), at para. 7). In June of 1999, he was found guilty of sexually assaulting yet another unconscious woman. For the 1987 conviction, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 23 months, for the 1998 conviction 4 months and for the 1999 conviction 30 months. [110]His most recent sexual assault occurred in 2002. On this occasion he entered a dwelling house without permission from the occupants and found a 22-year-old woman in the living room unconscious due to alcohol consumption. When she awoke, Mr. Ladue was assaulting her and attempting to remove her pants. She was unable to resist due to her intoxication, but the attack was interrupted when other residents of the house were awakened by what was happening and Mr. Ladue escaped from the home. He was convicted following a trial for break and enter and sexual assault and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. It was this offence that caused him to be found a long-term offender. [111]Mr. Ladue was released under a seven-year LTSO in December 2006. During the time between his release and the breach in question in this appeal, he was convicted for breaching his LTSO by consuming intoxicants on three occasions and sentenced in total to two years in prison, with 16 and a half months credited for pre-sentence custody.",

However, an outstanding warrant requiring Mr. Ladue to submit to a DNA test was discovered at the time of his release. Apparently, due to a bureaucratic error, the warrant had not been executed during his period of detention and, according to counsel for Mr. Ladue in this Court, may have been altogether unnecessary, as a DNA sample may have been provided under a previous warrant. The warrant required that he appear in Surrey, B.C. This resulted in Mr. Ladue being sent to Belkin House, in downtown Vancouver, which did not offer the specialized support of Linkage House in Kamloops. Upon arrival, he was informed that his residency status did not allow an immediate transfer to Linkage House and that he would have to remain at Belkin House until the National Parole Board made the necessary change to his status. Within one week of his arrival at Belkin House, he reoffended and was subsequently charged with breaching his LTSO by consuming intoxicants.

The indictment charged thirteen counts of criminal breach of trust contrary to s. 296 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 336), thirteen counts of theft contrary to s. 294(a) (now s. 334(a)) of theCode, and one count of fraud contrary to s. 338(1)(a) (now s. 380(1)(a)) of theCode. The trial in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench was before Brennan J. without a jury. The Crown alleged that the appellant had wrongfully appropriated property which he held in trust for Abrams. The defence did not contest the receipt of funds by the appellant. The defence did contend, however, that despite Stinchcombe's formal status as trustee of the property, Abrams had in fact made Stinchcombe his business partner. Under this theory, Stinchcombe had acted as he was legally entitled to act. At issue therefore was the actual, as opposed to the formal, nature of the relationship between the two men. Patricia Lineham is a former secretary of Mr. Stinchcombe. She was a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry. There, she gave evidence which was, apparently, very favourable to the defence regarding the conduct of Abrams. The precise content of this testimony was not before the trial judge and is not in the record. Lineham was not listed on the indictment, but was subpoenaed by the Crown. After the preliminary inquiry but prior to the trial, Lineham was interviewed by an RCMP officer. A tape-recorded statement was taken. Crown counsel informed defence counsel of the existence but not the content of this statement. A request for disclosure was refused. Later, during the course of the trial, Lineham was again interviewed by a police officer and a written statement taken. Again, though defence counsel was advised of the existence of the statement, a request for disclosure was refused. Crown counsel also indicated that he would not be calling Lineham as she was not worthy of credit. It was not until the third day of the trial that defence counsel learned conclusively that Lineham would not be called by the Crown.",

At this time, he moved before the trial judge for an order that (i) the Crown call the witness, or (ii) the Court call the witness, or (iii) the Crown disclose the contents of the statements to the defence. A review of the record makes it clear that defence counsel was pressing for access to, or production of, both the tape-recorded and written statements and was not pressing the alternative requests. In support of this motion, counsel for the defendant indicated that Ms. Lineham refused to speak to him or his staff when they attempted to interview her about the contents of the statements. Crown counsel did not provide any basis for resisting production other than to say that in his view the potential witness was not worthy of credit. The trial judge dismissed the application. Brennan J. ruled that under the circumstances there was no obligation on the Crown to call the witness and that there was no obligation on the Crown to disclose the contents of the statements. The trial proceeded, and the accused was found guilty of all twenty-seven counts charged. A conditional stay was entered with respect to the thirteen theft counts. The Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from conviction without issuing reasons. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the disclosure issue. During argument before this Court, an application was made by the Crown to adduce the statements and the tape as fresh evidence. This application was rejected. The principal basis for the rejection was that at this stage it would be impossible to determine whether the statements would have been material to the defence if produced at trial.",

He had been living with his mother until she threw him out of the house in January or February of 1984. Broyles then lived with a number of people, including his grandmother, Lorraine Briggs. Briggs had a one bedroom basement suite in a house owned by an elderly man. Briggs slept in a camperized van which she parked in the back of the house, and which she drove to work. When Broyles stayed with her, he slept in an upstairs bedroom. Briggs worked as a cook at the Edmonton Journal Cafeteria. She started work at six in the morning, and was never late. On June 26, 1984, Briggs did not show up for work. Repeated phone calls to her home by her supervisor went unanswered. On July 3, Briggs' body was found under the stairwell in her home, wrapped in green plastic garbage bags. The body had begun to decompose. The cause of death was asphyxia resulting from strangulation; two coils of thick rope were still wrapped tightly around her neck when she was found. The body was dressed in a long sleeved sweater, a camisole and a nightie with a bra loosely arranged on the body but not in place. The nightie had been pulled up and the thighs and genital area exposed but it was impossible to say if Briggs had been sexually molested. A palm print was found on one of the garbage bags which was positively identified as being that of the accused Broyles. In the expert opinion of an R.C.M.P. laser expert, the print was \"most likely placed on the bag at a time when there was an item in the bag\". On July 4, Broyles was charged with two counts of forgery. On July 6, he was charged with murder. The only evidence implicating Broyles in the murder was circumstantial. Broyles was seen driving his grandmother's van at seven or seven thirty on the morning of her disappearance. He drove the van until his arrest on July 3. Broyles made numerous inconsistent statements about the events surrounding his grandmother's disappearance. Of particular importance on this appeal are statements made by Broyles to Todd Ritter.

Broyles added, \"[b]ut the cops don't know that I knew she was downstairs. Only my [lawyer] knows that. And now you do\". Broyles was convicted at trial before a judge and jury of second degree murder. He was given the minimum sentence of life in prison without eligibility for parole for ten years.

Broyles was then questioned by Detective Anderson. He was told that he was not obliged to say anything unless he wished to do so, but that anything he said might be given in evidence. The interview lasted from 8:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on July 3. Detective Anderson identified himself as being from the Homicide Branch of the Edmonton City Police. He did not tell Broyles that he was a suspect in the disappearance of the deceased Briggs. The interview was brought to an abrupt end when Anderson was called out of the room to be informed that Briggs' body had been discovered. Anderson began a second interview of Broyles at 11 p.m. on the same day. Anderson testified that, at the beginning of the second interview, Broyles was not a suspect in a homicide. Anderson added that at that time the police were not even sure that what they had was a homicide. Anderson brought the interview to an end at 11:30 p.m. because he thought he would get nothing new from Broyles. Anderson then processed the paper work for the forgery charges.",

English version of the reasons delivered by 37.Wilson J.‐‐I agree with my colleagues Chouinard and La Forest JJ. that the appeal should be dismissed. English version of the reasons of Le Dain and La Forest JJ. delivered by 38.La Forest J.‐‐I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Chouinard J., and I agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed. I also concur in his reasons. However, I would dispose of the first ground of appeal, concerning the meaning of the word \"obscene\" for the purposes ofs. 159of theCriminal Code, on a broader basis. 39.Section 159(2)(a), under which the accused was convicted, prohibits the sale or exposing to public view of obscene matter. In determining whether the articles in the possession of the accused for the purpose of sale were obscene Chouinard J., following Ritchie J. inDechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951, first considered whether in the circumstances those articles were publications, since in that case the definition of obscenity with regard to publications, contained in s. 159(8), applies. As the articles were similar to those at issue inDechow, he concluded that they were obscene publications under that subsection. 40.Although it is possible to arrive at this conclusion by this means, I think that it is preferable to dispose of the question more directly. In my view obscenity has the same meaning whether or not the articles at issue are publications. It is true that the route taken by Chouinard J. had already been indicated by Ritchie J., who wrote the majority judgment inDechow; but inDechow, the charge was laid under s. 159(1), which deals primarily with publication and other activities of that kind. Section 159(2)(a), on the other hand, deals with the sale of articles and their exposure to public view. These articles may undoubtedly be publications. But can it reasonably be concluded that if the articles in question in the present case were not publications, a different meaning could be given to the word \"obscene\" in this provision? I do not think so.",

I share the view expressed by the late Laskin C.J., in his concurring reasons inDechow, that the word \"obscene\" must be given the same meaning whether or not the articles in question are publications, that is, the meaning which appears in s. 159(8). 41.For many years the courts relied on the definition of obscenity formulated inR. v. Hicklin(1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360. More recently, however, this definition has been seriously criticized both in the courts and in academic writings. InBrodie v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681, for example, Judson J. described it as \"vague, difficult and unsatisfactory to apply\". It is worth noting that in the recent decision inTowne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, Dickson C.J., in a judgment concurred in by Lamer and Le Dain JJ., said at p. 502: It [the rule stated in s. 159(8)] supersedes rather than supplements the much‐criticized test enunciated by Cockburn C.J. inR. v. Hicklin. . . . Although in that case the Chief Justice's observation concerned films, it nonetheless suggests that application of the old rule is questionable to say the least. In this state of flux, especially in a matter so related to public opinion as obscenity, the courts should pay particular attention to what is said by Parliament, even when it does not directly address the point at issue. This is especially true here, for if we applied the old definition to articles which are not publications, not only would we be giving a different definition to the word in the same provision, we would be applying a harsher definition in less serious circumstances, as for example in the case of a private sale by someone not a merchant. 42.It is true that the opinion of Ritchie J. inDechowwas a majority opinion. Nevertheless, he did not indicate that he disagreed with the reasons of Laskin C.J. Rather, he simply said, at p. 968, that he \"[did] not find it necessary to consider what test is to be applied in determining whether or not matters other than publications are obscene\".",

It was admitted that the appellant signed Mrs. Salituro's name and that he cashed the cheque, but the appellant's defence was that he had his wife's authority to do so. Salituro denied this and the trial judge accepted her evidence over the appellant's and convicted him of forgery. The trial judge concluded on the basis of the appellant's testimony that the appellant and his wife were separated without any reasonable possibility of reconciliation at the time the appellant forged his wife's signature. Without Mrs. Salituro's testimony the appellant would not have been convicted. The issue is therefore whether Mrs. Salituro's testimony falls under an exception to the common law rule that a spouse is an incompetent witness for the prosecution. Since this is an appeal as of right, the appeal is limited bys. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, toquestionsof law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents. As a result there is only one question on this appeal: is there a common law exception to the rule against spousal competence for spouses who are separated without any reasonable possibility of reconciliation?",

    "text": "A.Overview of the Facts [5]The appellant pulled his motor home out from a stop sign onto a highway and into the path of an oncoming tractor-trailer. In the collision that resulted, the appellant's passenger was killed. The appellant was convicted of dangerous driving causing death and his appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. The facts are as simple as they are tragic. [6]On an afternoon in late November 2004, the appellant and Mark Anthony Harrington decided to return home after work at a sawmill near Vavenby, a town north of Kamloops, British Columbia. They left work together in the appellant's motor home to head back to a trailer park where they lived. They took a shortcut via the Harmon Road to reach Highway 5, the Southern Yellowhead Highway, and then planned to head south on the highway to the trailer park.[1]The Harmon Road is an unpaved back road which becomes relatively steep as it approaches the intersection with the highway. The appellant knew the Harmon Road well, having driven it to and from Highway 5 about 500 times before. [7]The Harmon Road intersects with Highway 5 in such a way that vehicles intending to turn from the road onto the highway to head south, as the appellant did to return to the trailer park, usually first veer towards the north in order to come squarely to the intersection. This enables them to better see the oncoming northbound traffic and better determine when it is safe to turn left, and cross the northbound lanes to head south. Constable Campbell testified that to turn onto the highway, he has \"to turn towards the right so I can come square at the intersection so I can see both ways\" (A.R., vol. II, at p. 167). That afternoon, visibility was limited due to fog and the Harmon Road was snow-covered and slippery. [8]On the afternoon of the accident, Michael McGinnis, accompanied by his daughter Darlene, was driving a tractor-trailer northbound on the highway. As he was approaching the Harmon Road intersection at about 3:00 p.m., the fog was thickening and the visibility was poor. The trial judge accepted Mr. McGinnis's evidence that the weather conditions led him to decrease his speed to between 75 and 80 kilometres per hour.",

That was the speed he was driving when, from a distance, he noticed the headlights of what we now know to have been the appellant's vehicle pointing towards him from what Mr. McGinnis assumed was the shoulder of the highway or the top of the side road. Although the trial judge did not make a specific finding on the point, both Mr. McGinnis and his passenger thought that the appellant's vehicle had stopped before proceeding onto the highway, although his passenger was not sure. Mr. McGinnis also testified that when he first saw the lights of the appellant's vehicle, he guessed that it was about 300-400 feet away but that it could have been as little as 100 feet. [9]When Mr. McGinnis saw the headlights, he took his foot off the accelerator. When he then realized that the appellant's vehicle was proceeding onto the highway, he applied his brakes, but it was too late. His truck violently collided with the appellant's vehicle, killing Mr. Harrington. The appellant survived, but the collision left him with no memory of either its circumstances or of the surrounding events.

The charge arises from an incident which occurred in the early morning hours of December 1, 1984. The appellant was arrested later that day. Two police officers attended at his home where he resided with his parents. Upon arrest, the appellant was informed of his right to counsel. Immediately after this, his father, Mr. Bain, told him not to say anything until he had seen a lawyer. While his son got dressed in preparation to accompany the police, Mr. Bain, with the help of one of the police officers, attempted to retain a lawyer by looking through the Yellow Pages. After being unsuccessful with two or three numbers, the police officer gave him a business card with his telephone number on it. He told Mr. Bain that when a lawyer had been retained, the lawyer should call the officer at the number on the card. The appellant then left with the officers. After both officers returned to the car, they drove off with the appellant and parked down the street. The police officers updated their notebooks and were discussing between themselves what had occurred in the house. According to one of the officer's (McIntyre) testimony in chief, the appellant initiated an inculpatory conversation. During his testimony on thevoir dire, the appellant denied making some of these statements; in particular, he denied making the inculpatory admissions. Upon arrival at the police station, the appellant was placed alone in an interview room. About 25 minutes later, a lawyer who had been retained by Mr. Bain called for the police officer. McIntyre returned the telephone call 10 minutes later. The lawyer told McIntyre that he had been retained by the appellant's parents on behalf of the appellant. McIntyre informed the lawyer of the circumstances of the investigation and of the alleged sexual assault and told the lawyer that the appellant would probably be released later that day. The lawyer could not attend at the police station that day so he simply told McIntyre not to take any statement from the appellant until he, the lawyer, was present. On the stand, the lawyer could not remember whether he had asked to speak to the appellant.",

Following this telephone conversation, McIntyre (and another officer, Chisholm) went into the interview room with the appellant. According to the appellant's testimony, he asked whether his father had called. McIntyre told him that his father had not called. The appellant said that he wanted to contact his father to find out if his father had retained a lawyer. McIntyre told the appellant that he could call his father later. At no time did McIntyre tell the appellant about the telephone call from the lawyer. The police officers initiated an interrogation of the appellant. The appellant told the officers that he was very impaired the previous night due to the intake of a considerable amount of alcohol as well as one \"hit\" of L.S.D. The officers then questioned the appellant about his prior relationship with the complainant. He was also questioned about his interaction with the complainant on the night in question. On April 21, 1987, the appellant was tried before a judge and jury in Brampton, Ontario, on a charge of sexual assault. Following arraignment, but before the first prospective juror was asked to step forward, appellant's counsel sought a ruling that both the Crown and the defence each be limited to four peremptory challenges and that the Crown be denied the power to stand jurors by. The trial judge made the requested ruling based on his own holdings to the same effect in other cases. He considered himself bound by his own ruling \"until the Court of Appeal rules otherwise\". The Crown's objection was noted. The jurors were then selected with both the defence and the Crown exercising their four peremptory challenges. Following a 14-day trial, the jury acquitted the appellant. On January 31, 1989, the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal ((1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 250) and ordered a new trial.

Mr. Porter, it seems, was given to collecting equipment on his premises and running motors which made loud noises. This disturbed Mr. Lohnes. It disturbed him so much that on two occasions a year apart he went onto the veranda of his house and shouted obscenities at Mr. Porter. The essence of Mr. Lohnes' remarks was that he did not want Mr. Porter \"to run that chain saw or that lawn mower or to leave that or have that God-damned junk heap\". This was embellished by a string of epithets revealing an impressive command of the obscene vernacular. On the second occasion Mr. Lohnes concluded his oration with the assertion that he would shoot Mr. Porter if he had a gun. Mr. Porter filed a complaint. He was the only Crown witness. There was no evidence that anyone else heard Mr. Lohnes' statements or that Mr. Porter's conduct was affected by them. Mr. Lohnes was convicted on the ground that his conduct in itself constituted a disturbance withins. 175(1)(a) of theCriminal Code; the trial judge found, as well, that Mr. Porter was \"disturbed\" by the impugned conduct. The convictions were upheld by the summary conviction appeal court. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division refused leave from that decision: (1990), 100 N.S.R. (2d) 268, 272 A.P.R. 268.

The shop sells and rents \"hard core\" videotapes and magazines as well as sexual paraphernalia. Outside the store is a sign which reads: \"Avenue Video Boutique; a private members only adult video/visual club. Notice: if sex oriented material offends you, please do not enter. No admittance to persons under 18 years. On August 21, 1987, the City of Winnipeg Police entered the appellant's store with a search warrant and seized all the inventory. The appellant was charged with 173 counts in the first indictment: three counts of selling obscene material contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‐34 (now s. 163(2)(a)), 41 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1)(a) (now s. 163(1)(a)) of theCriminal Code, 128 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Codeand one count of exposing obscene material to public view contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Code. On October 19, 1987, the appellant reopened the store at the same location. As a result of a police operation a search warrant was executed on October 29, 1987, resulting in the arrest of an employee, Norma McCord. The appellant was arrested at a later date. A joint indictment was laid against the appellant doing business as Avenue Video Boutique and Norma McCord. The joint indictment contains 77 counts under s. 159 (now s. 163) of theCriminal Code: two counts of selling obscene material contrary to s. 159(2)(a), 73 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1)(a), one count of possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary to s. 159(2)(a) and one count of exposing obscene material to public view contrary to s. 159(2)(a). The trial judge convicted the appellant on eight counts relating to eight films. Convictions were entered against the co‐accused McCord with respect to two counts relating to two of the films. Fines of $1,000 per offence were imposed on the appellant. Acquittals were entered on the remaining charges.

The majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Crown and entered convictions for the appellant with respect to all of the counts, Twaddle and Helper JJ.A. dissenting. Court of Queen's Bench(1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 97 Wright J. first considered whether the materials were obscene within the meaning ofs. 163(8)of theCriminal Code. He noted that Canadian courts have interpreted the application of the \"community standards\" test to mean that as long as the trier of fact does not apply his or her subjective personal views but seeks objectively to ascertain the community standard, he or she may resolve that issue simply by drawing on his or her \"experience\". Wright J. expressed serious difficulties in applying the community standards test, stating that to render a factual decision on the basis of experience is contrary to the judicial role and that he regards his own views drawn from his \"experience\" to be unreliable. However, Wright J. was able to conclude on the basis of previous case law that the materials in question were obscene (at p. 113): In the context of my own inability to confidently draw on my experience, and my belief, in any event, that it is incongruous and inconsistent with basic judicial legal principles to do so, normally I would be inclined to hold that the requisite community standard of tolerance has not been proved as an essential ingredient of the Crown's case and all the charges should be dismissed. However, it is clear, from a review of the case‐law binding on me that independent of the manner in which a trial judge is directed to measure obscenity, material of the kind before the court has been well established as obscene and must continue to be regarded as obscene within theCriminal Codedefinition.",

    "text": "Applying the Canadian decisions on obscenity since the inclusion of s. 163 in theCriminal Code, Wright J. found that there was no doubt that the videos and magazines in the present case fall into the category of \"hard porn\" and that the sexual devices are similar to the kind of sexual paraphernalia held by this Court inDechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951, andGermain v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 241, to fall under the obscenity definition. Accordingly, he found that all of the materials referred to in the various charges in the indictments are obscene according to the case law interpretation of s. 163(8). Wright J. then concluded that the obscene material was protected bys. 2(b)of theCharter. Following the principles inIrwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, he noted that obscene expression reflected in the material certainly conveys meaning and is entitled to protection provided the form of expression is not violent. In conducting the s. 1 analysis, Wright J. was of the view that legislation which seeks to proscribe a fundamental freedom must have as its objective a more precise purpose than simply to control the morals of society or to encourage decency. He wrote, at p. 121: The aim must be directed more specifically to objectives such as equality concerns, or otherCharterrights, or particular human rights; otherwise, the basic freedoms in theCharterwill be subject to restrictions that arise from very personal and subjective opinions of right and wrong that will be impossible to identify . . . . Examples of more precise aims or bases for restrictions will be: (1)The protection of people from involuntary exposure to pornographic material; (2)the protection of the vulnerable, for example children, from either exposure or participation; (3)the prevention of the circulation of pornographic material that effectively reduces the human or equality or otherCharterrights of individuals. This may arise, and often will arise, in material that mixes sex with violence or cruelty, or otherwise dehumanizes women or men. Applying these standards, he concluded that on aprima faciebasis, only those materials which contained scenes involving violence or cruelty intermingled with sexual activity or depicted lack of consent to sexual contact or otherwise could be said to dehumanize men or women in a sexual context were legitimately proscribed under s. 1.",

In this context, I am unable to conclude that the depiction of the human body or any of its parts, no matter how explicitly presented, or the visual presentation of masturbation, group sex or other heterosexual or homosexual activity, including incestuous relations,prima facierelate to sufficiently specific concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society to justify restricting or limiting the basic freedom permitting them to be expressed. The same reasoning applies in respect of the material before the court described as sexual toys or devices. The Crown has failed to bring forward cogent and persuasive evidence to demonstrate the specific objectives sought to be achieved, and to show that such objectives justify the limits on freedom of expression which the impugned legislation seeks to bring about.",

In attempting to establish this offence, the Crown sought to introduce evidence of the whereabouts of the appellant obtained through the use of an electronic tracking device (a \"beeper\") installed in his car. A beeper may be described as a radio transmitter, usually battery operated, which emits periodic signals that can be picked up by a radio receiver. The background and manner of installation may briefly be summarized as follows. The appellant had for some time been under surveillance by the Ontario Provincial Police (the O.P.P.) who suspected him of involvement in a recent murder in Morewood, Ontario which they believed to be linked to a series of similar killings in the area. In the course of its homicide investigation, the O.P.P. on July 14, 1987 applied for a warrant to search the appellant's home and vehicle on the following grounds: that the police had spotted the appellant driving his automobile towards his home shortly after the murder; that they had observed, in the back seat of his car, a pair of binoculars, a pair of work gloves, and a plastic rain coat, which appeared used; that they had observed under the car soil and vegetation (Timothy, a plant common to the area) similar to that found on the victim's property; that the appellant's voice sounded similar to that on a tape of someone who purported to be the murderer, though the voice appeared disguised and could not be positively identified; that the appellant had been a suspect in certain of the previous homicides; and that he had an extensive criminal record for break and enter, robbery, theft, and offences relating to offensive weapons. The police obtained the warrant and conducted the search but found nothing in either the accused's home or vehicle to link him to any of the homicides. Pursuant to the terms of the warrant, the police had towed the appellant's automobile to the police station to carry out the search. Some time later, more than thirty hours after the expiration of the warrant, they installed an electronic tracking device in the interior of the appellant's vehicle.",

The \"beeper\" was surreptitiously hidden in the foam in the back seat of the appellant's car, causing minor damage to the seat. This, the trial judge held, was done on the basis of \"mere suspicion\" and it was, of course, done without judicial authorization. The car was then returned to the appellant. The beeper emitted a radio frequency transmission which could be detected by a police scanner for a distance of up to three kilometres. Though the device was rather unsophisticated, and the person who installed it thought it was capable of giving only its general location, he had not counted on the ingenuity of the police who by listening to the tone and using an antenna held outside the window of a police vehicle could be led in a specific direction. Along with constant visual surveillance, the device enabled the police to track the appellant's whereabouts at all times of the day or night. The trial judge found that the police used the device on a constant basis for a period extending over many months, and pertinently, over a month prior to the commission of the offence alleged in the present case, both to track the vehicle in motion and to pinpoint its location when stationary. On August 15, 1987, the day of the alleged offence, the police had lost visual contact with the appellant's vehicle but were able to trace its location using the beeper. Upon moving to that location, the police established surveillance on a vehicle resembling the appellant's that was parked in a driveway. Approximately two hours later, the police surveillance team heard a loud noise which sounded like metal crashing. The crashing sound was caused by the felling of a Bell Canada communications tower, the value of which was in excess of $2 million. Soon after, the police observed another vehicle, which was in fact the appellant's and appeared to be identical to the one they were watching, pull out of a laneway in a nearby field from which the crashing sound had emanated. The second vehicle was later located at the appellant's residence.",

    "text": "Mr. Milne, through his company National Electronics Security Inc., supplied goods and services to the Hudson's Bay Co. An account for $16,981 was paid by the Hudson's Bay Co., by sending the company a cheque in that amount which Mr. Milne deposited into his company's account. A month later, due to an error by the Hudson's Bay Co., a second cheque for $16,981 was received and deposited by Mr. Milne into his company's account. Mr. Milne then appropriated the money by writing company cheques in his own favour. These cheques were certified by Mr. Milne, and reduced the balance of his company's account to practically nil. Mr. Milne had sole signing authority for the company account. A security officer for the Hudson's Bay Co. was unable to contact Mr. Milne concerning the mistaken payment, despite leaving repeated messages. The question of whether a theft occurred in this case is governed bys. 322(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, which states: 322.(1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent, (a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it; (b) to pledge it or deposit it as security; (c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or (d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted. The trial judge concluded that Mr. Milne knew that the second cheque had been issued to his company by mistake, and given this knowledge, his actions in depositing it and then withdrawing the money constituted a conversion. It seems to me that the only inference to be drawn from these circumstances is that [Mr. Milne] knew that the money received by the issuing of the second cheque had been paid in error, and that the funds should not have been deposited to this account.",

    "text": "In my view the actions of [Mr. Milne] who had knowledge of these circumstances in writing cheques on the numbered account which contained funds that should not have been in that account constituted theft. Further, he held that Mr. Milne had performed this conversion fraudulently, and without colour of right, with the result that he was guilty of theft. This decision was overturned by a majority of the Court of Appeal: (1990), 77 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1, 109 A.R. 268, 59 C.C.C. (3d) 372, [1991] 1 W.W.R. 385 (hereinafter cited to Alta. L.R.). Côté J.A. observed that whatever the intent of Mr. Milne, he could not commit theft if the Hudson's Bay Co. did not retain a property interest in the money it mistakenly paid to Mr. Milne's company. He then examined the law of property with respect to payment under mistake and noted that in some cases such a payment transfers property, while in others it does not. After analyzing the cases, Côté J.A. came to the view that whether property passes despite mistake depends on the kind of mistake which has been made. If the mistake has to do with the object of the transfer, or its recipient, then property does not pass. However, if the transferor gives the intended object to the intended recipient, property does pass, even if the intention itself was based on a mistake (at p. 20): Property passes if, and only if, the transferor gives the very object he believes and intends to the very person he believes and intends. That is so whether or not his willingness and decision to do so stem from fraud, forgetfulness, or spontaneous mistake, so long as the chattel and the recipients are the ones he intends. But if he mixes up recipients, or mixes up property, and gets the wrong chattel or wrong recipient, no property passes. That is so whatever caused his mistake, be it fraud or mishap. Here the Hudson's Bay Co. intended to issue a cheque to National, and issued it just as intended with National as payee. They intended to deliver it to National, and got it into the hands of National. They intended National to negotiate it and keep the proceeds, and National did so. The Hudson's Bay Co. did not confuse payees or property.",

The Hudson's Bay Co. did not confuse payees or property. The Hudson's Bay Co. succeeded: they got the property intended into the hands of the intended recipient. They knew, but forgot or overlooked, that they did not have to do so. Property passed. The Hudson's Bay Co. gained a civil cause of action for a like sum, but lost property in the cheque and its proceeds. Neither [the respondent] nor his company National did anything to induce that payment. Since in the present case, it was the intention of the Hudson's Bay Co. to transfer property in the proceeds of the second cheque to Mr. Milne, property did in fact pass. The fact that this intention was based on the mistaken belief that the Hudson's Bay Co. owed Mr. Milne the money did not prevent the passing of money, though it created a civil cause of action for its return. Côté J.A. noted that the nature and validity of the underlying contractual relationship were quite irrelevant to the question whether property passed through the second cheque (at p. 20): And I agree that the test here is not whether there is operative mistake making void a contract. (No one here suggests property was to pass or not pass by contract. It was to pass or not pass by wording the payee of the cheque and by mere delivery.) Having set out the civil law relating to property in this manner, Côté J.A. observed that it was not imperative that the civil law relating to property and the criminal law relating to theft should accord completely. However, any other result would lead to anomalies. Indeed, commercial practicality pointed in the same direction as the civil legal principles. For instance, the ongoing web of payments between two companies is often complex and overpayments and allegation of overpayment are common. Côté J.A. noted that if mistaken overpayment did not transfer property, a new kind of preference in bankruptcy would exist that had not been noticed before.",

Côté J.A. also noted that the most commercially practical response to the receipt of a mistakenly paid cheque may often be to deposit it and then arrange for a refund cheque to be issued. If property never passes in the first place, even this could amount to theft. Côté J.A. rejected any application of trust principles or the law of conversion to this case (at p. 21): In this case there is no question of a \"special property\". On anyone's view, all property passed to National or none of it did. Here there was no bailment, conditional sales contract, trust, or other split property, in the eyes of criminal law or civil law. The Hudson's Bay Co. did not retain any property interest of any kind:Barclay's Bank v. Simms, supra. Nothing turns here on conversion. The doctrine extends the common law notion of what is a taking, and extends theft to cover those who already have possession. It does nothing to change whether property passes or does not pass. Nor does it affect who is the owner whose goods are taken or converted. Finally, Côté J.A. noted that while Mr. Milne was certainly dishonest in his dealings with the second cheque, this particular form of dishonesty did not amount to theft, and could be dealt with in a number of other ways under theCriminal Code. For these reasons, the majority in the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and set aside the conviction. In dissent, McClung J.A. disagreed with the majority's conclusion that property in the proceeds of the second cheque had passed in law to Mr. Milne. According to him, the law of unilateral mistake intervened on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Co. and avoided the transaction. Because the Hudson's Bay Co. tendered the sum of $16,981 for services that had been paid for earlier, it was mistaken as to a fundamental term of the transaction, and this mistake was recognized by Mr. Milne. \"On those facts the contract was not merely voidable, but void, and no rights could be created by it\" (p. 6). Hence no title to the funds was passed.",

Applying those principles to the facts, he concluded that the funds had been entrusted to Mr. Milne, through his company, for the payment of the services earlier rendered.

The union was again directed to cease threatening strike action, and was specifically directed not to strike on Monday, January 25. This directive also gave notice to the union that the directives would be filed as an order of the Court of Queen's Bench. The first directive was so filed, pursuant to s. 142(7) of the Act, on January 24, the day before the strike was scheduled to commence. The second directive was filed with the court forthwith.

    "text": "Basic fact presumptions can be further categorized into permissive and mandatory presumptions. A permissive presumption leaves it optional as to whether the inference of the presumed fact is drawn following proof of the basic fact. A mandatory presumption requires that the inference be made. Presumptions may also be either rebuttable or irrebuttable. If a presumption is rebuttable, there are three potential ways the presumed fact can be rebutted. First, the accused may be required merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to its existence. Secondly, the accused may have an evidentiary burden to adduce sufficient evidence to bring into question the truth of the presumed fact. Thirdly, the accused may have a legal or a persuasive burden to prove on a balance of probabilities the non-existence of the presumed fact. Finally, presumptions are often referred to as either presumptions of law or presumptions of fact. The latter entail \"frequently recurring examples of circumstantial evidence\" . . . while the former involve actual legal rules. [Emphasis in original.] A very useful analysis of presumptions that can be utilized in this case can be found in the writing of T. Cromwell in \"Proving Guilt: The Presumption of Innocence and theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" in W. Charles, T. Cromwell and K. Jobson, eds.,Evidence and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms(1989), 125, at pp. 130ff. (which in turn is based on the analysis favoured by Professor Cross inEvidence(5th ed. 1979), at pp. 122ff., approved inOakes). The presumptions can be summarized in this way: 1) Presumptions which operate without the requirement of proof of any basic facts. 2) Presumptions which require proof of a basic fact. (a) Permissive Inferences: Where the trier of fact is entitled to infer a presumed fact from the proof of the basic fact, but is not obliged to do so. This results in a tactical burden whereby the accused may wish to call evidence in rebuttal, but is not required to do so. (b) Evidential Burdens: Where the trier of fact is required to draw the conclusion from proof of the basic fact in the absence of evidence to the contrary. This mandatory conclusion results in an evidential burden whereby the accused will need to call evidence, unless there is already evidence to the contrary in the Crown's case. (c) Legal Burdens:",

(c) Legal Burdens: Similar to the burden in (b) except that the presumed fact must be disproved on a balance of probabilities instead of by the mere raising of evidence to the contrary. These are also referred to as \"reverse onus clauses\". The nature of the right to be presumed innocent set out ins. 11(d)of theCharterwas first considered inDubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350. There Lamer J. (as he then was) was concerned with the nature of the right in connection withs. 13which provides protection against self-incrimination. In that case he stated (at p. 357): Section 11(d) imposes upon the Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as well as that of making out the case against the accused before he or she need respond, either by testifying or by calling other evidence. Thus there is implicit in the right to be presumed innocent an obligation on the Crown to make out a case for the accused to meet before a response can be called for from the accused. InSchuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, this Court once again considered the presumption that had come before it inProudlock,supra. Eventually the case turned upon whether an acquittal in the face of such a presumption constituted a question of law or a fact. Nonetheless the decision is helpful in its qualification of the presumption. It was held at p. 610 that: But when the burden has been shifted (as is the case for proof of intent when a person is found in a place which he or she has broken into), it can be said, absent any evidence to the contrary, that there is no evidence upon which a reasonable doubt could exist as regards the intent of the accused, and an appeal against the ensuing acquittal raises a question of law alone. In other words the presumption required the trier of fact to convict in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. This presumption would come within category 2(b). InR. v.",

Oakes,supra, the Court considered s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Actwhich provided that if the Crown was able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been in possession of a narcotic, then the accused was to be \"given an opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking\". The section in effect required the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that he did not have possession of the narcotics for purposes of trafficking. It was held that s. 11(d) required that an individual must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; that the State must bear the burden of proving this; and proof of guilt must be accomplished \"according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal\". Dickson C.J. applying this basic principle to the reverse onus provision contained in s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Actconcluded at pp. 132-33 that: In general one must, I think, conclude that a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d). If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. This would arise if the accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact was untrue. The Chief Justice went on to note that even though a rational connection might exist between the established fact and the presumed fact this may not be sufficient to render the presumption constitutional. On page 134 he stated: A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a presumed fact, but not prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt. An accused person could thereby be convicted despite the presence of a reasonable doubt. This would violate the presumption of innocence.",

Contrary to the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Dickson C.J. stressed that the rational connection between the proven and the presumed fact is better taken into account when analyzing the effect ofs. 1of theCharteron the impugned legislation, rather than in the process of determining whether s. 11(d) had been violated. The principles set forth inOakeswere applied inR. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, wheres. 213(d) of theCriminal Codewas questioned. The section provided that the offence of murder was committed if the accused used a weapon or had it on his person at the time he commits or attempts to commit an offence or during flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence. Thus a conviction of murder was possible although the accused had neither an objective nor subjective intent to kill the victim. Lamer J. speaking for the majority of the Court concluded that the Crown was required to prove all elements of the offence together with those required to satisfys. 7of theCharter. He found that any provision which created an offence which allowed for the conviction of an accused notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element infringeds. 7and s. 11(d). He wrote at pp. 654-55: These essential elements include not only those set out by the legislature in the provision creating the offence but also those required bys. 7of theCharter. Any provision creating an offence which allows for the conviction of an accused notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element infringesss. 7and 11(d). Clearly, this will occur where the provision requires the accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities an essential element of the offence by requiring that he raise more than just a reasonable doubt. It is for this reason that this Court struck down the reverse onus provision in s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Act.. . . Sections 7 and 11(d) will also be infringed where the statutory definition of the offence does not include an element which is required under s. 7.

Finally, the legislature, rather than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential element, may substitute proof of a different element. In my view, this will be constitutionally valid only if upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the substituted element it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element. If the trier of fact may have a reasonable doubt as to the essential element notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the substituted element, then the substitution infringes ss. 7 and 11(d). InR. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3, the accused was charged with having the care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired. The accused was found in the driver's seat of an automobile, slumped over the steering wheel. The keys were in the ignition but the engine was not running. The Crown relied on the same presumption considered inAppleby,supra, which placed the burden on an accused found in the driver's seat of establishing the absence of an intention to enter the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion. The presumption was challenged and it was found that it did in fact infringe s. 11(d). It was held that the word \"establishes\" required proof on a balance of probabilities. The Crown argued that the section only required proof of an excuse rather than a disproof of any essential element of the offence. That argument was not accepted. Dickson C.J. for the Court stated at p. 18: The real concern is not whether the accused must disprove an element or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be convicted while a reasonable doubt exists.

He then continued: If an accused is required to prove some fact on the balance of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the accused. . . . In the passage fromVaillancourtquoted earlier, Lamer J. recognized that in some cases substituting proof of one element for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if, upon proof of the substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element. This is another way of saying that a statutory presumption infringes the presumption of innocence if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt. Only if the existence of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the conclusion that the essential element exists, with no other reasonable possibilities, will the statutory presumption be constitutionally valid. It was held that the presumption in that section did not have that required \"inexorable\" character and thus failed the test proposed inOakesandVaillancourt. InR. v. Kowlyk, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 59, the validity of a conviction based solely on the doctrine of recent possession was questioned. McIntyre J. held that the provision created no more than a permissive presumption from which the trier of fact may, but not must, draw an inference of guilt of theft from the possession of recently stolen property. He put his position in this way at pp. 71-72: . . . where an explanation is offered for such possession which could reasonably be true, no inference of guilt on the basis of recent possession alone may be drawn, even where the trier of fact is not satisfied of the truth of the explanation. The burden of proof of guilt remains upon the Crown, and to obtain a conviction in the face of such an explanation it must establish by other evidence the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

He reviewed the reasons inWhyte,supra, and then put forward his position in these words (at p. 790): As is evident from the above quotation, the categorization of a factual finding as forming an element \"essential\" to the offence is of no consequence when determining whether s. 11(d) has been breached. Applying the approach taken inWhyteto this appeal, it is obvious that s. 319(3)(a) runs afoul of the presumption of innocence. Contrary to the arguments of those who would find s. 319(3)(a) compatible with s. 11(d), it matters not that the defence of truth may be intended to play a minor role in providing relief from conviction. What is of essence is not the \"essential nature\" of the crime, but that the trier of fact will have to convict even where there is a reasonable doubt as to the truth of an accused's statements. Perhaps it may be helpful to summarize the principles to be derived from the authorities. I - The presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. II - If by the provisions of a statutory presumption, an accused is required to establish, that is to say to prove or disprove, on a balance of probabilities either an element of an offence or an excuse, then it contravenes s. 11(d). Such a provision would permit a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt. III - Even if a rational connection exists between the established fact and the fact to be presumed, this would be insufficient to make valid a presumption requiring the accused to disprove an element of the offence.",

IV - Legislation which substitutes proof of one element for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if as a result of the proof of the substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the other element. To put it another way, the statutory presumption will be valid if the proof of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the proof of the other. However, the statutory presumption will infringe s. 11(d) if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt. V - A permissive assumption from which a trier of fact may but not must draw an inference of guilt will not infringe s. 11(d). VI - A provision that might have been intended to play a minor role in providing relief from conviction will nonetheless contravene theCharterif the provision (such as the truth of a statement) must be established by the accused (seeKeegstra,supra). VII - It must of course be remembered that statutory presumptions which infringe s. 11(d) may still be justified pursuant tos. 1of theCharter. (As for example inKeegstra,supra.) It is now necessary to apply these principles to the presumption set out in s. 195(2) to determine whether it contraveness. 11(d)of theCharter. Application of the Principles Pertaining to Section 11(d) to the \"Living on Avails\" Provision The presumption contained in s. 195 infringess. 11(d)of theChartersince it can result in the conviction of an accused despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. For example consider the situation of a spouse or companion of a prostitute, who is working, self-supporting and not dependent or relying upon the income garnered by the spouse or companion from prostitution. There is nothing parasitical about such a relationship. Neither being a prostitute nor being a spouse of a prostitute constitutes a crime. Yet as a result of the presumption, the spouse could be found guilty despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.",

Without going into the rather complex details of the family relationship, it may be simply stated that the respondent lived with and assumed a quasi-paternal role vis-à-vis the three girls, being the uncle of B.W. and having been married to the mother of S.W. and M.W. The first three charges (two of indecent assault and one of gross indecency) concerned B.W. She was between two and four years old when the incidents occurred in 1981-82, seven years old when the offences were reported to the authorities, and nine years old at the time of trial. The fourth charge (of sexual assault) concerned M.W. She was between nine and ten at the time of the events in question, eleven when the offences were reported, and twelve at the time of trial. The fifth charge (of indecent assault) concerned S.W. She was ten years old at the time of the events in question, fourteen at the time of reporting, and sixteen at the time of trial. The substance of the charges is as follows. B.W. alleged that while she was living with the respondent and his wife (her uncle and aunt) in the red brick house in Napanee, the respondent would come and take her from her bed, which she shared with S.W. and M.W., and lead her upstairs to his bedroom, where he would take down her pants, drop his pyjamas, and rub his soft penis over her vagina. B.W. stated in evidence that this happened two or three times a week. On one occasion, the respondent asked B.W. to suck on his \"dink\", which she did (this incident is the basis of the gross indecency charge). B.W. also described a further incident which occurred on a camping trip, when the respondent took her into the family's van, laid her on the floor, and rubbed his penis over her vagina. S.W. described two incidents in the red brick house in Napanee. S.W. and the respondent were fully clothed throughout both incidents. The first incident began as play-wrestling, but the respondent began to breathe heavily and rubbed his erect penis against her buttocks.",

There can be no doubt in this case that an agency relationship existed between Kelly and his clients and that Kelly was aware of the existence of that relationship. Indeed this element of the offence was not an issue on this appeal or at the trial. (b)Accepting a Benefit to Influence One's Principal ‐‐ The Second Element The second element the Crown must prove is that the agent took the benefit as consideration for acting in relation to the affairs of the agent's principal. There can be no doubt that Kelly accepted a commission from a third party. It goes without saying that this commission comes within the category of a \"reward, advantage, or benefit\" required by s. 426. Nor can there be any question that the commissions were accepted as consideration for doing an act in relation to the affairs of the principals. Clearly, Kelly accepted the payment for recommending and eventually selling the MURBs to his clients. To establish the requisitemens reafor this second element, the Crown must prove that the taker, knowingly accepted the commission as consideration for acting in relation to the affairs of his clients or principals. It must be remembered that offences involving \"secret commissions\" are by their very nature secretive. They arise from operations that are inherently covert. It follows that courts should in these cases apply common sense and draw the reasonable and appropriate inferences from the proven facts. Certainly Qualico's purpose in paying commissions to Kelly would be to encourage Kelly to influence his clients to purchase Qualico MURBs. Here it was Kelly who sought out Qualico to negotiate an agreement for selling MURBs and for receiving commissions on those sales. It was Kelly who advised the resident manager of Qualico that he had \"good solid\" clients to whom he could sell the MURBs. On the first development, Kelly was prepared to incur the risks of a performance bond with a strict time limit as part of the agreement for selling the entire development. The only time that Kelly advised any of his clients to purchase MURBs was when the Qualico developments were put on the market.",

(3d) 481. At pages 484‐85, Lambert J.A. related the facts: Arthur Dick is a member of the Alkali Lake Band of the Shuswap people. He lives on the Alkali Lake Reserve in the Chilcotin District of the County of Cariboo. He is a non‐treaty Indian. The Alkali Lake Band is comprised of about 10 families, or approximately 350 people, all told. They subsist in large measure by foraging. They catch fish for food and they kill deer and moose for food and other uses. The Shuswap word for May is \"Pellcwewlemten\". It means \"time to go fishing\". In response to this imperative Arthur Dick and two other band members, with two members of the Canoe Creek Band, set off on May 4, 1980, for Gustafsen Creek, where they intended to catch fish. On the way they passed Holdon Lake. There Arthur Dick killed a deer with a rifle. His purpose was to provide food for the members of the foraging party and for other band members. The carcass, cut up in pieces, was taken on to Gustafsen Creek where a provincial conservation officer and four R.C.M.P. constables found the five Indians in possession of dip nets, a number of rainbow trout, and the deer meat. 3.One precision should perhaps be added. The killing of the deer occurred in the traditional hunting grounds of the Alkali Lake Band but outside a reserve. I now return to the recital of the facts by Lambert J.A.: The Wildlife Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, said it was a closed season for hunting for deer. So Arthur Dick was charged under the Act with two counts; first, with killing wildlife, to wit; one deer, at a time not within the open season, contrary to s. 3(1); and, secondly, with possession of wildlife that was dead, to wit: parts of one deer, during a closed season, contrary to s. 8. It was also a closed season for fishing in Gustafsen Creek. All five Indians were charged with respect to the fishing, and those charges are the subject‐matter of a separate appeal by the Crown, raising quite different issues from those raised in this appeal.",

Nevertheless, the question as to whether the disclosure was adequate in all the circumstances must still be determined. I cannot accept the contention that the findings made at the trial are adequate to resolve the issue. The Court of Appeal was correct in its conclusion that the trial judge's finding that the Crown had failed to prove the requisite intent was based on a misapprehension as to the intent required. For the reasons set out inKelly, it was not necessary for the Crown to establish that there was a corrupt bargain. Nor was the trial judge correct as to the standard of disclosure that was required. The argument that there was a finding made at trial that there was no secrecy on the part of the appellants cannot be accepted. That finding was made only in relation to the appellants' books which disclosed all the transactions. The testimony given by clients of the appellants was overwhelmingly to the effect that no disclosure was made to them that commissions would be received by the appellants from the promoters of the developments for the sale of the units. It will be for the judge presiding at the new trial to determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, the disclosure made by the appellants to their clients was adequate and timely.

They can be read in the judgments of the courts below, all of which have now been reported. 5.At pages 30‐31, Taggart J.A. thus begun the recital of the facts: The appellants are both members of the Tsartlip Band of Indians and live on the Tsartlip Indian Reserve in Saanich, British Columbia. The Tsartlip Band is one of the bands making up the Coast Salish people. Elizabeth Jack is the wife of the appellant Anderson Jack and the sister of the appellant George Louie Charlie. She was present when her brother shot a deer on Pender Island at a place which is not within an Indian reserve. Anderson Jack helped George Louie Charlie load the dead deer into the trunk of their car. The three then drove to the place where they had been staying on Pender Island and there cleaned and dressed the deer. Later as they were driving to the ferry which would take them to Saanich they were stopped by police officers who found the deer carcass in the trunk of the car. 6.At page 341, the trial judge said: The two accused testified they had committed the act in order to help Elizabeth Jack obtain raw deer meat for a burning ceremony for her great‐grandfather. 7.At page 27, the County Court judge wrote: They freely admitted to the killing and possession; their plea before the provincial court, and here, is one of confession and avoidance. The deer, they contend (and the evidence on this point is accepted in its entirety by the Crown) was killed in preparation for a religious ceremony, in which the meat thereof would be burned to satisfy the requirements of an ancestor by means of a sort of reverse transubstantiation. 8.The religious ceremony and its meaning were described by several defence witnesses. Here is what Taggart J.A. wrote about this at pp. 31‐32: The religious ceremony was described by witnesses who were members of the Tsartlip Band and by Dr. Barbara Lane. Dr. Lane is an anthropologist who since 1948 has studied the Coast Salish people and especially their religious beliefs and practices. She said that the Coast Salish people were believed to have lived in British Columbia for about 20,000 years.",

    "text": "She said that the Coast Salish people were believed to have lived in British Columbia for about 20,000 years. The Coast Salish believe that members of their people who die do not go to another world but that their spirits remain close to where they lived. The belief is that the spirits have the same kinds of needs and desires as living people. Dr. Lane explained the belief in this way: They become lonely and want to visit their relatives, they become hungry and want to have the kind of foods that they had before, and they have desires for other things that they've left behind here, and they transmit these desires to their close relatives through dreams and other kinds of experiences, and these needs are satisfied and the desires of the deceased relatives are met by the living providing to them the things that they request. ... As I was attempting to suggest earlier, the entire world view of Coast Salish Indian people is quite different from that which those of us who are raised in the Judaeo‐Christian tradition have. Coast Salish Indian people perceive of the world as an intimately inter‐related phenomenon in which the living and the dead animals and humans, all things are intimately connected and belong together in this place and do not leave it. And the function of burning food for the dead is to carry on the mutual responsibilities and respect that Indian people here try to accord to all of the other parts of the world as they see it. One of the things that always seems to be incomprehensible to Indian people is how the rest of us can pick ourselves up from one part of the world and move to another and abandon and cut themselves off from our dead relatives because they perceive of themselves as being in continuous association with and having ongoing responsibilities to the dead. Dr. Lane described the practice of serving the spirits of the dead by burning food. Well, this is a very ancient traditional practice among all Coast Salish people and the essence of the ceremony is to provide food for deceased relatives by burning it and the essence of the food, as I understand it, is transmitted through the smoke to the essence of the deceased person.",

The latter said she had been visited by the spirit of her great grandfather who had asked that she burn raw meat for him. She sought the assistance of her husband and her brother to obtain raw deer meat for the burning ceremony. 9.There can be no doubt about the sincerity of the appellants' religious beliefs. Here is what the trial judge held on this subject, at pp. 339 and 341: That evidence was interesting, revealing the religious beliefs and practices of the Coast Salish Indians and of the Saanich people, part of the Coast Salish tribe or culture, to which people the two accused and Mrs. Elizabeth Jack belong, as well as the witnesses for the defence Louie Charlie, David Elliott, Tom Sampson, Samuel Sam, Louie Charlie and Philip Paul. I should also say at the outset that I believe the defence is put forward sincerely by these people and that they are, so far as appears, quite law abiding persons who committed the act rather fearfully, but apparently in thebona fideeffort to obtain deer meat for a religious ceremony. The impression I obtained from the evidence was that they were fearful of breaking this law, because they are law abiding persons usually. ... I must say, also, that I found the elders of the Saanich people impressive. Some of those who spoke in English are very articulate, although they are naturally inclined to use few words, but ingenuously poetic in a manner which obviously springs from deep sincerity.",

What is false may, as the case on appeal illustrates, be determined by reference to what is generally (or, as inHoaglin, officially) accepted as true, with the result that the knowledge of falsity required for guilt may be inferred from the impugned expression's divergence from prevailing or officially accepted beliefs. This makes possible conviction for virtually any statement which does not accord with currently accepted \"truths\", and lends force to the argument that the section could be used (or abused) in a circular fashion essentially to permit the prosecution of unpopular ideas. Particularly with regard to the historical fact -- historical opinion dichotomy, we cannot be mindful enough both of the evolving concept of history and of its manipulation in the past to promote and perpetuate certain messages. The danger is not confined to totalitarian states like the Nazi regime in Germany or certain communist regimes of the past which blatantly rewrote history. We in Canada need look no further than the `not so noble savage' portrayal of Native Canadians in our children's history text books in the early part of this century. Similarly, in the United States, one finds the ongoing revision of the historical representation of African Americans, whose contribution to aspects of the history of the United States, such as their contribution to the North's victory in the Civil War, is only now being recognized. But perhaps the greatest danger of s. 181 lies in the undefined and virtually unlimited reach of the phrase \"injury or mischief to a public interest\".",

    "text": "But perhaps the greatest danger of s. 181 lies in the undefined and virtually unlimited reach of the phrase \"injury or mischief to a public interest\". Neither the respondent nor its supporting interveners has proffered any case law in which this phrase has been applied to a given factual circumstance in a clear and consistent manner. My colleagues refer to the \"serious harm\" and \"serious injury\" caused by deliberate falsehoods, but this begs the question of what sort or degree of harm is necessary in order to bring the section into play. Indeed, the limited jurisprudence on s. 181 evidences conflicting opinions on what constitutes a threatened or injured \"public interest\" justifying criminal sanction. It is difficult to see how a broad, undefined phrase such as \"public interest\" can on its face constitute a restrained, appropriately limited measure which impairs the right infringed to the minimum degree consistent with securing the legislation's objectives. Any deliberate lie (potentially defined as that which does not accord with accepted truth), which causes or is likely to cause \"injury\" or \"mischief\" to any \"public interest\" is within the potential reach of the section. The interpretation given to \"public interest\" in this case may not have been objectionable. But that is not the issue in determining whether a legislative restriction of rights is overbroad. The issue is whether the provision permits the state to restrict constitutional rights in circumstances and ways that may not be justifiable. The vague and broad wording of s. 181 leaves open that possibility. Cory and Iacobucci JJ. propose to overcome this difficulty by defining the phrase \"public interest\" in accordance with selectedChartervalues. Two observations are relied upon -- that courts regularly define phrases in legislation, and that the courts have not, thus far, adequately defined \"public interest\" -- as the justification to define anew \"public interest\" in the context of s. 181's purported application to Mr. Zundel. Although the section's \"legislative history\" and the \"legislative and social context in which it is used\" is said by my colleagues to govern the definitional process, their interpretation focuses upon a select range ofChartervalues, values which do not include freedom of expression. In support of this technique, reliance is placed upon the following authorities:Hills v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 513;Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; andR. v.",

Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; andR. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654. These authorities confirm the following basic propositions: that the common law should develop in accordance with the values of theCharter(Salituro,supra, at p. 675), and that where a legislative provision, on a reasonable interpretation of its history and on the plain reading of its text, is subject to two equally persuasive interpretations, the Court should adopt that interpretation which accords with theCharterand the values to which it gives expression (HillsandSlaight,supra). None of these decisions stands for the proposition that an age-old provision whose aim and scope was created pre-Chartercan, as of 1982, be redefined by reference to a present-day perception of utility. The result of my colleagues' redefinition is the equation of \"public interest\" with \"the protection and preservation of those rights and freedoms set out in theCharteras fundamental to Canadian society\" (p. 000). Thus, for example, whenever the Crown can establish that the publication of a false statement is likely seriously to injure the dignity and equality of those whomss. 15and27of theCharterare intended to protect, the offence is made out. In so doing my colleagues have arguably created a new offence, an offence hitherto unknown to the criminal law. The promotion of equality and multiculturalism is a laudable goal, but, with respect, I can see no basis in the history or language of s. 181 to suggest that it is the motivating goal behind its enactment or retention. To import it is to engage not in a valid process of statutory interpretation, but in impermissible reading in of content foreign to the enactment;Salituro,SlaightandHillswere never intended to be taken this far. Section 181 can be used to inhibit statements which society considers should be inhibited, like those which denigrate vulnerable groups. Its danger, however, lies in the fact that by its broad reach it criminalizes a vast penumbra of other statements merely because they might be thought to constitute a mischief to some public interest, however successive prosecutors and courts may wish to define these terms.",

Thus worthy minority groups or individuals may be inhibited from saying what they desire to say for fear that they might be prosecuted. Should an activist be prevented from saying \"the rainforest of British Columbia is being destroyed\" because she fears criminal prosecution for spreading \"false news\" in the event that scientists conclude and a jury accepts that the statement is false and that it is likely to cause mischief to the British Columbia forest industry? Should a concerned citizen fear prosecution for stating in the course of political debate that a nuclear power plant in her neighbourhood \"is destroying the health of the children living nearby\" for fear that scientific studies will later show that the injury was minimal? Should a medical professional be precluded from describing an outbreak of meningitis as an epidemic for fear that a government or private organization will conclude and a jury accept that his statement is a deliberate assertion of a false fact? Should a member of an ethnic minority whose brethren are being persecuted abroad be prevented from stating that the government has systematically ignored his compatriots' plight? These examples suggest there is merit in the submission of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association that the overbreadth of s. 181 poses greater danger to minority interest groups worthy of popular support than it offers protection. These examples illustrate s. 181's fatal flaw -- its overbreadth. At pages 000-000, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. attempt to alleviate the fears associated with the problem of overbreadth by arguing that the Crown will always bear a heavy onus in proving all of the elements under s. 181. It is argued that any danger is limited by the phrase \"public interest\" because even those publishing known falsehoods will not be prosecuted where their lies have an \"overall beneficial or neutral effect\". In this way, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. claim that the examples proffered above raise no practical problem (see p. 000).",

I, for one, find cold comfort in the assurance that a prosecutor's perception of \"overall beneficial or neutral effect\" affords adequate protection against undue impingement on the free expression of facts and opinions. The whole purpose of enshrining rights in theCharteris to afford the individual protection against even the well-intentioned majority. To justify an invasion of a constitutional right on the ground that public authorities can be trusted not to violate it unduly is to undermine the very premise upon which theCharteris predicated. Cory and Iacobucci JJ. make no mention of the reality that the decision to prosecute must, by necessity, be made by state agents and that the issue must be adjudicated upon by a judge and jury in a particular locale with a particular conception of a benefit to the public. All it takes is one judge and twelve jurors who believe that certain `falsehoods' compromise a particular \"public\" interest, and that such falsehoods `must have been' known to the accused, in order to convict. A jury in Port Alberni, B.C., may have a very different view of the overall beneficial impact of false statements of fact impugning the lumber industry than a jury in Toronto. Finally, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. fail to address the argument that the danger raised by these examples, the `chilling effect' of s. 181, outweighs its minimal benefit given the alternative means of prosecution of speech detrimental to racial tolerance unders. 319of theCriminal Code. Not only is s. 181 broad in contextual reach; it is particularly invasive because it chooses the most draconian of sanctions to effect its ends -- prosecution for an indictable offence under the criminal law. Our law is premised on the view that only serious misconduct deserves criminal sanction. Lesser wrongs are left to summary conviction and the civil law. Lies, for the most part, have historically been left to the civil law of libel and slander; it has been the law of tort or delict that has assumed the main task of preserving harmony and justice between individuals and groups where words are concerned. This is not to say that words cannot properly be constrained by the force of the criminal law.",

After reviewing that evidence, the court concludes that the offences of indecent assault with which the accused is charged are disclosed by that evidence. [Emphasis in original.] The trial judge thus determined that the indictment did not have to be signed by the Attorney General and could be preferred by his prosecutor. Quebec Court of Appeal, [1991] R.J.Q. 741, 37 Q.A.C. 214 Malouf J.A. gave the reasons of the majority. Monet J.A. filed separate reasons concurring in the result while Fish J.A. dissented. Malouf J.A. observed that pursuant tos. 574of theCriminal Codean indictment can be preferred in respect of any charge founded on the facts disclosed in evidence at the preliminary hearing. Section 574 provides: 574.(1) Subject to subsection (3) and section 577, the prosecutor may prefer an indictment against any person who has been ordered to stand trial in respect of (a) any charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial, or (b) any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or in substitution for any charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial, whether or not the charges were included in one information. Malouf J.A. found that all the requirements of s. 574 were met in this case. The preliminary hearing provided evidence which disclosed the offence of indecent assault. As a result, the new indictment charging the accused with indecent assault did not require the Attorney General's signature. When he read the reasons of his colleagues, Malouf J.A. added to his own reasons. He observed that the appellant in this case had every opportunity to make full answer and defence. At the time of the substituted indictment of indecent assault, the accused (appellant) had been completely informed as to the evidence pertaining to the offence with which he was charged and had received all the benefits that a preliminary inquiry can provide. In his view, no prejudice had been occasioned by the substitution of the new indictment. He noted as well that the procedural point upon which Fish J.A. based his dissent was not raised before the trial court or argued before the Court of Appeal.",

The parties had not been given an opportunity to review the issue and in his opinion the Court of Appeal should decline to decide that issue. Monet J.A. in concurring reasons agreed that the original indictment was flawed. Further he conceded thatR. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, established that the offences of indecent assault and sexual assault were not identical. However, he went on to observe that for the victim the terminology was unimportant. For society, the reprobation was precisely the same. For the accused in this case, the acts under investigation were identified and the circumstances surrounding those acts were fully investigated at the preliminary inquiry. The accused had been committed for trial and this committal had not been attacked by the accused. It followed that in his view the new indictment signed by the Attorney General's prosecutor was valid. Fish J.A. found that the Crown was bound to prefer a direct indictment in the circumstances of this case. Although the appellant's focus was on s. 577(b), which pertains to indictments preferred when a preliminary inquiry has been held, Fish J.A. based his reasons on s. 577(a). He concluded the preliminary inquiry was a nullity and as a result it could not be said that there had been ade factopreliminary inquiry which led to a committal for trial. In his view there could be no legal and valid trial on the first indictment because it disclosed no offence. It followed that there could be no legal and valid inquiry on an information framed in such a way that it did not disclose an offence. In his opinion there was no jurisdiction to hold the preliminary inquiry based on an information that was invalid. In the result the preliminary inquiry and committal to trial were voidab initio. Fish J.A. conceded that there were strong arguments in favour of the validity of the indictment. He too observed that the essential elements of the charge which were investigated at the preliminary inquiry were, in fact, substantially if not legally identical to those for which the appellant was eventually tried.

In February of 1987, Sergeants Oakley and Ross travelled to Toronto to interview the appellant, who was being detained on other charges in Ontario. In the course of subsequent questioning, Sims made certain statements to the police. Sims talked to the officers about the possibility of pleading guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter. He stated that he was sick and needed help -- that he \"couldn't keep on hurting old people\". He expressed a wish to be transferred to Victoria to \"get Norm off\", asking out loud: \"if Norm wasn't actually involved in the hitting it may affect his sentence?\" The interviews led to a critical statement. In response to a remark as to the laudable loyalty of Sims' father, Sergeant Ross testified that the appellant stated: \"All the grief I have been causing . . ., all the shit I have been doing, killing a 71-year-old woman, nice.\"",

Both the respondent and Ms. King were American citizens, ordinarily resident in Detroit. At the respondent's trial, the evidence showed that on August 6, 1986, the respondent picked up Ms. King at her mother's house in Detroit. Together, they drove across the border to Canada. The respondent spent the weekend of August 9 and 10 with Ms. King in a hotel in London, Ontario. Ms. King's body was subsequently discovered at approximately 1:30 a.m. on August 11, near a service station at Beechville, Ontario. The body was found lying on a sheet which may have come from the hotel where Ms. King and the respondent had spent the night. Certain fibres found on the sheet matched fibres from the clothing of the respondent and Ms. King. The body's arms had been cut off, and were never found. The theory of the Crown was that the respondent was a drug smuggler who had travelled to Canada with Ms. King in order to obtain cocaine. The Crown hypothesized that the respondent had asked Ms. King to take the cocaine back to the United States concealed in her body, but that she had refused. According to the Crown, he then abandoned her at the hotel in London. However, he later returned to pick her up, and drove her to a place where he strangled her, cut off her arms to impede identification, and dumped her body. In support of this theory, the Crown relied upon evidence of four telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother in Detroit at 10:21 p.m., 11:21 p.m., 11:54 p.m. and 12:41 a.m. on the night between August 10 and August 11, 1986. The first two telephone calls were traced to the telephone in Ms. King's room at the hotel in London. Ms. King's mother testified that in the first telephone call, her daughter said that Larry (the respondent) had abandoned her at the hotel in London and that she wanted a ride home. In the second call, Ms. King told her mother that Larry had still not returned. Her mother testified that she then telephoned from Detroit to a taxi company in London to attempt to arrange a ride home for her daughter.",

The fourth telephone call was traced to a pay telephone at the service station near which Ms. King's body was found.

In addition to these calls, there was evidence that a further telephone call had been made shortly after 1:00 a.m. on August 11 from a pay telephone at the service station near which Ms. King's body was later found. This call was traced to the respondent's residence in Detroit. There was no direct evidence as to who made this telephone call, or what was said.

Ms. Denard testified that the respondent had asked her to smuggle illegal drugs back to the United States for him, and that when she refused, he drove her to Windsor and abandoned her at a restaurant. The respondent did not testify at his trial, but set up a defence of alibi supported by the evidence of various witnesses who placed him in Windsor or Detroit at or around the time of the murder.

Indeed, it was apparently the theory of the defence that the respondent actually did abandon Ms. King at the hotel in London, a hypothesis supported by the evidence of what Ms. King said in the first two telephone calls to her mother. However, the defence contended that after leaving Ms. King, the respondent returned to Detroit and did not return to the hotel, and therefore could not have been with her when she was murdered. The respondent appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. The Court of Appeal found that evidence as to what was said in the telephone calls made by Ms. King to her mother on the night of the murder was hearsay, and therefore was inadmissible unless it fell within some recognized exception to the hearsay rule. The Court of Appeal went on to decide that the evidence as to what was said by Ms. King in the first two telephone conversations was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, but only for the purpose of establishing her state of mind at the time when she made the calls, i.e., that she wanted to come home. The evidence as to what was said in the third telephone conversation, however, fell within no exception to the hearsay rule, and was therefore not admissible for any purpose. The Court of Appeal concluded that the inadmissible hearsay evidence had been so gravely prejudicial to the respondent that it could not say that, had it not been admitted, the verdict would necessarily have been the same. Therefore, notwithstanding the failure of defence counsel to object to the evidence at trial, the Court of Appeal declined to apply the curative provision in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.

The transcript of the preliminary inquiry was filed with the Court of Appeal and with this Court as the factual basis for the appeals. On December 31, 1987, Teresa Santos attended a New Year's Eve party in Toronto. Shortly after midnight, a fight broke out at the party. As she was attempting to gather her belongings, which were located at a table in the vicinity of the fight, Ms. Santos was struck on the arm by a piece of glass. The glass fragment produced a large gash on her left forearm which required seven stitches to mend the underlying pronator muscle in her arm and a further seven stitches to mend the skin above the muscle. Eight months later, the feeling and movement in the victim's forearm was still restricted. The victim's husband, Fernando Santos, was standing near his wife while the fight was in progress. He noticed that the appellant and a number of others were involved in the altercation. The appellant and the Santos were standing approximately eight feet away from a wall on opposite sides of the same table. Some of the men who were fighting began throwing bottles. Mr. Santos then noticed the appellant throw a bottle which hit the wall beside Ms. Santos and shattered. A piece of glass from the bottle thrown by the appellant ricocheted off the wall and struck the victim on the arm causing her injury. As a result of this incident, the appellant was charged with unlawfully causing bodily harm contrary to s. 245.3 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 269). He was committed for trial after a preliminary inquiry held on October 31, 1988. At the outset of the trial and before any evidence was heard, the accused made a motion to have s. 269 declared of no force or effect on the ground that it contraveneds. 7of theCharter. The motion was granted and the indictment was quashed. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the motion judgment was overturned and the order quashing the indictment was set aside.

On February 9, 1990, the appellant voluntarily made an inculpatory written statement to a \"person in authority\" after having been cautioned and advised of hisCharterrights. The appellant was 18 years old when he made the impugned statement and the police treated him as an adult. As such, he was not advised of his right to have an adult person in attendance when making the impugned statement. At the time the statement was made, the appellant was accused of the offence. Avoir direwas held regarding the admissibility of the inculpatory statement. Landerkin Prov. Ct. J. ruled that the appellant was entitled to the protections afforded under s. 56(2) and therefore the inculpatory statement was inadmissible. Following an application, the appellant was acquitted on October 18, 1990: 114 A.R. 321, 115 A.R. 354. The Crown conceded that the only evidence it had against the appellant was the inculpatory statement. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the ground that the trial judge erred in holding that s. 56(2) mandated the exclusion of the statement from evidence. On August 27, 1991, the Court of Appeal for Alberta allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial: 82 Alta. L.R. (2d) 193, 117 A.R. 75, 2 W.A.C. 75, 66 C.C.C. (3d) 441.",

She stated in part: (1)\"... it was open to the trial Judge to have inferred that the sun would not have presented a visibility problem had Morin stopped and looked to the east along the highway before leaving the stop sign. This issue was not addressed by the trial Judge\" (p. 96). (2)The trial judge failed to consider the evidence in its totality. Accordingly, the trial judge failed to appreciate or disregarded material evidence. Under these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant's driving was such as to constitute dangerous driving. In support of this conclusion, Her Ladyship relied on the following passages fromR. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at pp. 71, 72 and 77: An acquittal based on an erroneous conclusion of reasonable doubt constitutes a question of law where the trial judge has erred as to the legal effect of undisputed or found facts rather than the inferences to be drawn from such facts. ... A question of law may also arise, it seems to me, when the trial judge misdirects himself or herself with respect to the relevant evidence. ... A review of the trial judge's decision in this case makes it clear that he failed to consider the evidence in its totality. This was the result of misdirection and brought the matter within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.",

Shortly thereafter, a preliminary inquiry was held and Pearson was committed to trial. At the end of the preliminary inquiry, Pearson brought an application to the preliminary inquiry judge unders. 523(2)(b) of theCriminal Codeto review the order that he remain in custody until trial. The preliminary inquiry judge refused to review this order. Pearson then brought an application forhabeas corpus.

Thehabeas corpusapplication was heard by Biron J. of the Quebec Superior Court on November 17, 1989.

There was only a single determination of credibility to be made. If they believed the accused's exculpatory evidence at trial, they must of necessity have disbelieved his inculpatory statements to the police. It must be remembered, though, that the accused need never establish his or her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt; that standard only and always applies to the Crown. The accused must only raise a reasonable doubt with his or her evidence, even where he or she bears an evidentiary burden; seeR. v. Proudlock, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525. With these observations, I would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by La Forest J. //Le juge La Forest// The judgment of La Forest, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by La Forest J.-- The appellant, John Alexander MacKenzie, was accused of murdering three of his neighbours in the early hours of June 24, 1989. At trial, a jury found him not guilty. The acquittal was overturned on appeal, and a new trial was ordered. The appellant appealed to this Court as of right, seeking the restoration of his acquittal. At the time of his trial, the appellant was 47 years old. He was an alcoholic. In 1985, after living for 25 years in Toronto, he moved back to his home community in rural Antigonish County, Nova Scotia. He purchased a plot of land in Beech Hill, and in 1988 moved a mobile home onto the lot and made it his home. The three victims of the shooting, John Boucher, Joseph Deon and Edmund Deon, were neighbours of the appellant. Each owned a home on the Beech Hill Road within a kilometre of the appellant's property. The Deons were brothers, and were good friends of Boucher. For some reason, the Deons and Boucher apparently engaged in a concerted campaign of harassment against the appellant that lasted from the time he moved to Beech Hill until their deaths.",

This harassment verged on terrorism, consisting of repeated property damage, the killing of the appellant's pets, shooting bullet holes through his mailbox, and a series of threats to shoot him or dynamite his trailer. In the early morning of Saturday, June 24, 1989 the Deons and Boucher were shot to death. Boucher was shot three times in his yard, Edmund Deon was shot seven times in his bedroom, and Joseph Deon was shot twice while sitting at the wheel of his pick-up truck, which was parked in his driveway. All the shots came from the appellant's .22 calibre revolver. The revolver was retrieved by police the next day from the appellant's well, along with a pair of his shoes. During the six weeks before the shootings the appellant was drinking heavily. On June 12, two weeks before the shootings, he discovered that a calf of his was missing. Suspecting his neighbours, he took his revolver and confronted Boucher and his wife Lorraine at their home. They were able to calm the appellant down, and she drove him home. At trial, the appellant testified that Lorraine Boucher took his revolver from him at that time, and that this was the last he saw it. Boucher did not testify on this point. Later that evening, the appellant decided to confront Edmund Deon about the calf. He could not find his revolver, so he took a .303 rifle with him. During the confrontation that ensued the appellant discharged the rifle into the floor of Deon's house. The next day the RCMP arrested the appellant, detained him overnight, and confiscated his rifle. On June 23 the appellant spent most of the day drinking at his mobile home with his brother-in-law, William Cogger. The appellant consumed about 21 beers during the day. Boucher visited them for about an hour in the evening, drank at least one beer, and left without any dispute or incident. At around 11:00 p.m. the appellant and Cogger went to sleep. Sometime during the night, they were awakened by a knock at the door.",

Cogger heard nothing more, and fell back asleep. The appellant testified that the visitor was Joseph Deon. At 4:17 a.m. Daniel Girrior, another neighbour on the Beech Hill Road, was awakened by three gunshots. It was not unusual to hear gunshots at night in that area, so Girrior went back to sleep. William Cogger awoke at 4:45 a.m. to find the appellant sitting fully dressed at a table. Cogger testified that the appellant said he got the \"three sons-of-whores last night.\" Cogger said \"tell me this is not the truth\", to which the appellant replied \"no brother it's not true.\" The appellant then said he was going to put his gun down the well, and left the house. On returning, he spoke about getting rid of his shoes. At 4:58 a.m. Daniel Girrior heard three shots. Two minutes later he heard three more shots. At trial, the appellant testified that he fell back to sleep after Boucher's early morning visit. The next thing he remembered was waking up on the floor, with the idea that he had seen the bodies of the Deons and Boucher on the Beech Hill Road. He felt he must have been dreaming, and told Cogger about the dream. He was surprised to see his revolver on the table, as he had not seen the gun since Lorraine Boucher took it from him two weeks earlier. The appellant had no recollection of shooting the Deons and Boucher, or of throwing the revolver and the shoes down the well. The appellant and Cogger spent the rest of June 24 drinking. At about 9:00 p.m. the appellant was arrested by the RCMP. Realizing that he was drunk, the police did not attempt to question him. He was given food and at 11:30 p.m. was put in jail for the night.

The officers left the appellant alone to call his sister so she could retain a lawyer. When they returned a pause of several minutes ensued when nothing was said.

He was displaying his wares on Yonge Street near Dundas Street when he was approached by Constable Coulis of the Metropolitan Toronto Police. Constable Coulis informed the appellant that exposing goods for sale on the street without a licence violated s. 11 of Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto By-law 211-74. The appellant was issued a Provincial Offences ticket and instructed to pack up his display and move on. Constable Coulis allowed the appellant a brief grace period to check with his employer or lawyer if he was uncertain about moving, but told him that if he was still there when the officer returned, he would face criminal charges of obstructing the police. The appellant contacted his employer and was told that he was not to move. The appellant was still operating on the street upon Constable Coulis's return. Accordingly, the appellant was charged with obstructing a peace officer contrary tos. 129of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(formerly s. 118). He was convicted of both offences under the by-law charge and the criminal charge in Provincial Court. His appeals to District Court were dismissed.

Mr. and Mrs. L. were rarely at home and F.F.B. was responsible for the care of the L.'s twelve children. P.A.L. testified that the appellant began abusing her physically and sexually when she was six to eight years old and continued to do so until she was sixteen, at which time the appellant left the L. household. P.A.L. testified that the sexual abuse began with kissing, escalated to sexual touching and culminated in sexual intercourse when she was ten years old. The first incident of sexual intercourse allegedly resulted in P.A.L.'s hospitalization for twelve days with serious internal bleeding; she and the appellant both related at the time that she had injured herself while playing on the bannister of the front veranda. P.A.L. testified that a month after her return from the hospital, the appellant commenced to have sexual intercourse with her daily. P.A.L. gave birth to two sons at ages fifteen and sixteen, allegedly as a result of the sexual abuse by the appellant. Stories were apparently fabricated as to how these pregnancies occurred. P.A.L. was a shy person who had little contact outside the home; she testified that the appellant used constant threats and fear to enforce his will on her. P.A.L. testified that during this period she was also subject to repeated physical assaults. She testified to several specific incidents: that the appellant once pushed her to the ground and stepped on her face; that the appellant seriously cut her leg with a broken milk bottle; that the appellant burned her with a cigarette butt; and that the appellant forced her to consume a bottle of castor oil which resulted in her miscarrying a child. She stated that she bears numerous scars which resulted from this abuse. She also testified that the other children in the household were physically abused and terrorized by the appellant. In 1964, T.B., an older brother of P.A.L., caught the appellant having sexual intercourse with P.A.L. As a result, the appellant was forced to leave the L.'s household. In 1990, P.A.L. saw the appellant in a store. She testified that she decided then to report the alleged assaults to the police.",

As a result of this report, the appellant was charged with two counts of rape, three counts of assault, and one count of procuring a miscarriage. The appellant denied that any of the incidents described by P.A.L. occurred. During the course of the trial, the judge decided on avoir direnot to admit the evidence of D.M.L. (the complainant's sister) that she too had been sexually assaulted by the appellant, on the ground that it fell within the similar fact evidence rule and its prejudicial effect was not outweighed by its probative value. However, testimony of the complainant's brothers and sisters was admitted with respect to the violent control that the appellant exerted within the household. The appellant was convicted by a jury on five of the six counts (he was found not guilty of the charge of procuring miscarriage). He was sentenced to a total period of incarceration of 13 years. The appellant appealed his conviction to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal on two grounds which were both dismissed. At the conclusion of oral argument, the Court of Appeal requested counsel to make further written submissions on two issues that had been raised in oral argument. One of these related to the admissibility of evidence given by P.A.L.'s brother, L.L., and her step-brother, T.B. The appellant sought to have declared inadmissible those parts of L.L.'s and T.B.'s testimony which related to assaults by the appellant on P.A.L.'s siblings. The appellant was not seeking to exclude the evidence of T.B. that he finally discovered the appellant sexually assaulting P.A.L. and drove F.F.B. out of the house. The appellant's appeal on this ground was dismissed, Chipman and Hallett JJ.A. concurring in separate reasons that the testimony of L.L. and T.B. was admissible. Jones J.A. dissented, holding that L.L.'s and T.B.'s evidence was inadmissible since it was too prejudicial in relation to its probative value, and because it did not come within the parameters of the similar fact exception to the rule which excludes evidence of the accused's bad character.",

    "text": "On April 24, 1988, Joseph Wright and his brother Steven got off a bus at an intersection in Scarborough, Ontario. The brothers crossed the street and began walking home. At about the same time, the respondent and three other young men were driving past the same intersection. An argument started between the group in the car and the two men on the street and shortly thereafter a fight occurred. The brothers were unarmed. In the course of the fight one of the four persons from the vehicle pulled a knife, slashing twice at Joseph's face and then stabbing him in the chest. The stab wound to the chest penetrated Joseph's heart and killed him. The four young men then fled the scene. About two weeks later, the three young men involved with the respondent in the incident were interviewed separately by the police. While the appellant states that the three witnesses approached the police to make their statements, the respondent notes that two of the witnesses testified that they approached the police only after the police came to their homes in connection with the police investigation of the killing, and the third witness testified that it was his mother's idea that he give a statement to the police. Each was accompanied by a parent and in one case by a lawyer and each was advised of his right to counsel. It was also made clear that they were under no obligation to answer questions put to them by the police, and while the police told the witnesses that they were not charged with any offence, the interviewers also added the qualification \"at this time\" in two of the interviews. With the youths' consent the interviews were videotaped. In their statements, the three young men told the police that the respondent had made statements to them in which he acknowledged that he thought he had, or had, caused the death of the deceased by the use of a knife. The respondent was charged with second degree murder and he entered a plea of not guilty. Following an unsuccessful attempt by the Crown to have the case transferred to adult court, the respondent's trial commenced before Judge MacDonnell in Youth Court on November 14, 1989.",

    "text": "Following an unsuccessful attempt by the Crown to have the case transferred to adult court, the respondent's trial commenced before Judge MacDonnell in Youth Court on November 14, 1989. When called at trial by the Crown, the three young men refused to adopt their earlier statements respecting the admissions made by the respondent. The trial judge allowed the Crown to cross-examine them on their prior statements pursuant tos. 9of theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. They admitted they had made the statements to the police but said that they had lied to the police and that the respondent had not in fact made the incriminating statements that they had previously attributed to him. Their explanation for having lied to the police was that they did so to exculpate themselves from possible involvement. They claimed to have either forgotten what occurred when the respondent was alleged to have made his inculpatory statements, or to have not heard the respondent. The trial judge held that the only use that could be made of the prior inconsistent statements of the three witnesses was with respect to their credibility, and that the prior inconsistent statements could not be used as evidence of the truth of the matters stated therein; that is, they could not be tendered as proof that the respondent actually made the admissions. The only other evidence of the identity of the assailant was identification evidence provided by the victim's brother, who identified the accused at trial (in a \"dock\" identification with little evidential value) and testified as to the appearance of the deceased's assailant. The trial judge found that the dock identification was \"naked opinion given 19 months after the event\", and that the brother had only a poor opportunity to observe his brother's attacker. Doubts also existed in connection with his latter evidence because of several inconsistencies between elements of his description of the attacker shortly after the incident and elements of his description at trial, including: the type of jacket and pants worn by the assailant, the clothing of the other youths, and the height and weight of the assailant relative to the other youths.",

    "text": "At trial, the respondent argues, several other elements of the brother's description did not match the respondent's characteristics, including: the colour of the respondent's skin relative to the other youths, the fact that the assailant held the knife in his right hand while the respondent was described as left-handed by two of the recanting witnesses, whether the assailant wore jewellery, and the colour of the assailant's hair. As a result of the doubt which existed with respect to the issue of identification, and in the absence of other admissible evidence, the trial judge acquitted the respondent. The appellant appealed the acquittal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which stated that it was bound by the decisions of this Court, and accordingly dismissed the appeal. Between the filing of the parties' facta and the hearing of this appeal, the three witnesses pleaded guilty to perjury. The Crown brought a motion on the day of oral argument in this appeal to adduce this new evidence which it asserted was relevant to two issues: (i) whether the operation of a revised rule would tend to enhance or detract from the public's perception of and respect for the administration of justice, and (ii) whether the application of the orthodox rule had caused a miscarriage of justice in this case. Counsel for the respondent consented to the admission of this fresh evidence on this basis and for this purpose alone, and not as evidence of the respondent's innocence or guilt. Counsel for the Crown agreed to this limitation.",

    "text": "Let us now consider whether the modified objective test was properly applied in this case. The trial judge carefully examined the circumstances of the accident. He took into account the busy downtown traffic, the weather conditions, and the mechanical conditions of the accused vehicle. He concluded, in my view very properly, that the appellant's manner of driving represented a gross departure from the standard of a reasonably prudent driver. No explanation was offered by the accused that could excuse his conduct. There is no reason for interfering with the trial judge's finding of fact and application of the law. In the result the appeal must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed. Solicitors for the appellant: Giusti, Chamberlain & Ellan, Vancouver. Solicitor for the respondent: The Ministry of the Attorney General, Vancouver. *Stevenson J. took no part in the judgment.",

    "text": "The appellant, Robert Théroux, was a businessman involved in residential construction in the province of Quebec. He operated through a company called Les Habitations Co‐Hab Inc. Although a personal bankruptcy prevented him from serving as a director of Co‐Hab, Théroux was the directing mind, orâme dirigeante, of the company. The charges arise out of two residential housing projects Co‐Hab undertook through its subsidiaries, one in Laprairie and one in St‐Catherine. Sales to prospective home buyers were solicited from a trailer located on the Laprairie site. Co‐Hab's representative at this site entered into agreements for the purchase of the residences with a number of individuals, collecting deposits from them. The contracts were made and the deposits taken on the basis of a representation by Co‐Hab that the deposits were insured by the Fédération de construction du Québec. The representation was made orally. It was backed up by a certificate of participation in the insurance program posted on the trailer wall, which had been furnished to Co‐Hab before it completed the application process. In addition, a brochure describing the insurance program was distributed to most of the depositors. In fact, the representations that the deposits were insured were false. Co‐Hab never paid the premiums due on a first application for participation in the insurance program; a second application was never completed. The trial judge found that Théroux, as the directing mind of Co‐Hab, was responsible for these misrepresentations. The company which was to have built the residences became insolvent and could not complete the project. Some of the depositors got their money back, but most lost the entire amount.",

    "text": "The appellant ran a business as a wholesaler of T‐shirts and sweatshirts. Between November 1983 and January 1984, the appellant accepted goods with a value of more than $375,000 from his suppliers. The goods were supplied by Château Lingerie Mfg. Co., Tricot Mondial Inc. and Elizabeth Lingerie Mfg. These suppliers delivered goods to the appellant in return for post‐dated cheques or on credit. Over a three-month period which began about mid‐November 1983, the appellant gambled away all of the assets of his business. Among these assets were monies received from the sale of goods provided to the appellant by his suppliers. On all of the occasions of gambling, the appellant lost money using a system which he believed would increase his odds of winning. The appellant was declared bankrupt in February 1984. He owed his suppliers for goods supplied: $238,311 to Château Lingerie, $94,213 to Tricot Mondial, and $45,294 to Elizabeth Lingerie. He also owed $25,000 to a customer, Rose Dry Goods, for goods he had failed to supply. At trial, Morier J.S.P. found the appellant guilty of fraud, on counts 1, 5, 8, and 11 of the indictment, and stayed the other counts on the basis of the principle articulated inKienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. Counts 1, 5, 8, and 11 name the above mentioned suppliers and customer. This finding was upheld on appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, with a dissent by Tyndale J.A.",

    "text": "[56]As mentioned earlier, an offender may commit an offence \"in association with\" a criminal organization of which the offender is not a member. Membership in an organization, however, remains a relevant factor in determining whether the required nexus between the offence and the organization has been made out (seeDrecic, at para. 3). [57]The Crown must also demonstrate that an accusedknowinglydealt with a criminal organization. The stigma associated with the offence requires that the accused have a subjectivemens reawith respect to his or her association with the organization (seeLindsay(2004 S.C.J.), at para. 64). [58]There is ample evidence that Venneri knew that Dauphin was operating a large drug-trafficking organization ― or made himself wilfully blind to that obvious fact. And the evidence leaves no room for doubt as to the required nexus between Dauphin's organization and the offence of trafficking committed by Venneri. The organization received a direct benefit from the commission of the offence. [59]This was particularly evident after the 2005 seizures of cocaine when, as noted by the trial judge, Venneri became [translation] \"an important pillar\" in terms of supply. The evidence establishes that Dauphin was unable to secure cocaine without the assistance of Venneri. Manifestly, Venneri trafficked \"in association with\" the organization when he secured for it a source of supply following the 2005 seizures. VI [60]For all of these reasons, as stated at the outset, I would allow the appeal for the sole purpose of setting aside Venneri's acquittal on count 3, and otherwise affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Appeal allowed in part. Solicitor for the appellant: Poursuites criminelles et pénales du Québec, Montréal. Solicitors for the respondent: Monterosso Giroux, Montréal.",
