The relevant principles were canvassed by this Court in <i>R. v. Hodgson</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, and <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">It cannot be forgotten that it is the nature of the authority exerted by the state that might prompt an involuntary statement. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In other words, it is the fear of reprisal or hope of leniency that persons in authority may hold out and which is associated with their official status that may render a statement involuntary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; This limitation [i.e., the person in authority requirement] is appropriate since most criminal investigations are undertaken by the state, and it is then that an accused is most vulnerable to state coercion.

<div class="Section17">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The underlying rationale of the “person in authority” analysis is to avoid the unfairness and unreliability of admitting statements made when the accused believes himself or herself to be under pressure from the uniquely coercive power of the state.&nbsp; In <i>Hodgson</i>, although explicitly invited to do so, the Court refused to eliminate the requirement for a “person in authority” threshold determination.&nbsp; As Cory J. stated, were it not for this requisite inquiry,</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Thus, where the accused speaks out of fear of reprisal or hope of advantage because he reasonably believes the person receiving the statement is acting as an agent of the police or prosecuting authorities and could therefore influence or control the proceedings against him or her, then the receiver of the statement is properly considered a person in authority. In other words, the evidence must disclose not only that the accused subjectively believed the receiver of the statement to be in a position to control the proceedings against the accused, but must also establish an objectively reasonable basis for that belief.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

[T]he person in authority requirement has evolved in a manner that avoids a formalistic or legalistic approach to the interactions between ordinary citizens. Instead, it requires a case‑by‑case consideration of the accused’s belief as to the ability of the receiver of the statement to influence the prosecution or investigation of the crime. That is to say, the trial judge must determine whether the accused reasonably believed the receiver of the statement was acting on behalf of the police or prosecuting authorities.
