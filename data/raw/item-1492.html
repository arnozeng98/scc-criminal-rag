The victim died from wounds to the head.&nbsp; Semen was found in her vagina and a human bite mark had been left on her abdomen.&nbsp; At the police station, the accused‚Äôs lawyers informed the police by letter that the accused was not consenting to provide any bodily samples, including hair and teeth imprints, or to give any statements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the lawyers left, police officers took, under threat of force, scalp hair samples from the accused and he was made to pull some of his own pubic hair.&nbsp; Plasticine teeth impressions were also taken.&nbsp; A police officer then interviewed the accused for an hour in an attempt to obtain a statement.&nbsp; The accused sobbed throughout the interview and, after being permitted to call his lawyer, he went to the washroom escorted by an officer where he used a tissue to blow his nose.&nbsp; He threw the tissue in the wastebasket.&nbsp; The tissue containing mucous was seized by the officer and used for DNA testing.&nbsp; The accused was subsequently&nbsp; released but was arrested again several months later.&nbsp; At that time, a dentist took new impressions of the accused‚Äôs teeth without his consent in a procedure lasting two hours. &nbsp;More hair was taken from the accused, as well as a saliva sample and buccal swabs.</span></p>

These samples are usually in no danger of disappearing.&nbsp; If that power is so broad, then the common law rule itself is unreasonable, since it is too broad and fails to properly balance the competing rights involved.&nbsp; It is clear in this case that the accused‚Äôs right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was seriously violated.&nbsp; Since the search and seizure of the bodily samples was not authorized by either statutory or common law it could not have been reasonable.</span></p>

(dissenting): For the reasons given by Cory J., the arrest was a lawful one.&nbsp; While the search and seizure at issue was clearly not necessary in order to protect the accused, the police or the public,&nbsp; they were authorized by law under the common law search power incidental to arrest. The right to secure evidence as an incident of arrest does not depend on the existence of urgency or exigent circumstances and may extend to the taking of bodily samples and impressions. The following guidelines strike a proper balance between society‚Äôs interest in detecting and punishing crime and the individual‚Äôs interests in personal privacy and autonomy over his own body where the taking of bodily samples or impressions occurs as an incident to arrest:&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) the police must exercise their discretion to conduct the search given all of the circumstances; (2) the search must be for a valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice without running counter to the general objectives of the proper administration of justice;&nbsp; (3) consideration must be given to the intrusiveness involved in the search:&nbsp; the more intrusive, the higher the threshold for finding that the taking of bodily samples or impressions is both justified and conducted in a reasonable manner in given circumstances; (4) the police must have reasonable and probable grounds to conduct the search; (5) the search must be predicated on sufficiently important circumstances; those circumstances will generally be established where: (a) it is impracticable to obtain a warrant to secure the desired evidence; (b) such evidence cannot be obtained by a less intrusive means; (c) there is no alternative evidence available; (d) the offence for which the arrest was made is a serious one; and (e) public policy is served by the type of search at issue.&nbsp; Finally, the manner in which the search is conducted must not be abusive or unreasonable given the totality of the circumstances.&nbsp; A search which does not comply with these requirements could be characterized as unreasonable at common law as well as under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

They could not have proceeded with the murder charge without the DNA evidence or the bite‚Äëmark analysis of his teeth impressions.&nbsp; The search and seizure took place in order to achieve a valid objective ‚Äë‚Äë the discovery of evidence which could have either incriminated or established the innocence of the accused.&nbsp; The type of search and seizure at issue constituted minimal affronts to the accused‚Äôs bodily integrity.&nbsp; Although the taking of pubic hair and the making of dental impressions are more intrusive, on the whole, given that the accused was made to pull out some of his own pubic hair himself and that the dental impressions were made by a dentist according to professional standards, the taking of those specimens is not of such an offensive character in the present circumstances that it would constitute an unreasonable search.&nbsp;In this regard, the accused‚Äôs refusal to provide any bodily substance and the absence of his lawyers while the specimens were seized are irrelevant in assessing whether the police reasonably exercised their power of search incidental to arrest.&nbsp; Once a search is found to fall within the scope of such power, the police may, in accordance with these guidelines, proceed to search a lawfully arrested person.&nbsp; As well, while the accused‚Äôs bodily substances and teeth impressions could have been obtained later, this is not a relevant consideration.&nbsp; Further, the police had reasonable and probable grounds for taking bodily samples and dental impressions, given the results of the victim‚Äôs autopsy which revealed semen in her vagina and a human bite mark on her abdomen.&nbsp; The evidence discloses circumstances of sufficient importance to justify the taking.&nbsp; The police could not have obtained a warrant to secure the type of evidence they sought and the accused‚Äôs hair, saliva and dental impressions could not have been obtained by less intrusive means.&nbsp; Given the absence of any witness to the murder, there was no alternative evidence that the accused committed this serious offence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, public policy is served by the type of search at issue.&nbsp; Where indicia such as bodily fluids or a human bite mark are found on the victim‚Äôs body, the possibility of resorting to DNA typing analysis or forensic odontology serves society‚Äôs substantial interest in deterring such crimes.&nbsp; Since there was no breach of the accused‚Äôs <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights in the obtention of the evidence, such evidence was admissible at trial.</span></p>

Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, it was held that a search conducted without prior authorization is presumptively unreasonable.&nbsp; However, the long‚Äëstanding&nbsp; power of search incident to arrest is an exception to this general rule: see <i>Leigh v. Cole</i> (1853), 6 Cox C.C. 329, and <i>Bessell v. Wilson</i> (1853), 1 El. &amp; Bl. 489, 118 E.R. 518 (Q.B.).&nbsp; The original rationale for this power was based on (i) the need for the arresting officers to prevent the escape of the person arrested and to protect themselves by removing from the person arrested any weapon or tool that might facilitate escape and (ii) the need to prevent evidence under the control of the detainee from being destroyed.&nbsp; The common law power is eminently sensible and is essential for the protection of police officers carrying out their all too often dangerous duties.&nbsp; Yet, reasonable limits of that power have been defined to avoid abuses.</p>

Langlois</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158, the scope of the common law power of search upon lawful arrest was considered by this Court for the first time.&nbsp; The case established that such a search does not require reasonable and probable grounds beyond the grounds that were sufficient to support the lawfulness of the arrest itself.&nbsp; The reasons set out three limitations to the common law power.&nbsp; First, the power is a discretionary one and in certain circumstances the officer may properly exercise his or her discretion not to conduct a search.&nbsp; Second, the search must be for a valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice.&nbsp; Third, the search must not be conducted in an abusive fashion.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Paul</i> (1994), 155 N.B.R. (2d) 195 (C.A.), where Hoyt C.J.N.B. stated, at p.&nbsp;203, that:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Pohoretsky</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 945, at p.&nbsp;949, Lamer J., as he then was, noted that, ‚Äúa violation of the sanctity of a person‚Äôs body is much more serious than that of his office or even of his home‚Äù.&nbsp; In addition, La&nbsp;Forest&nbsp;J. observed in <i>R. v. Dyment</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, at pp.&nbsp;431‚Äë32, ‚Äúthe use of a person‚Äôs body without his consent to obtain information about him, invades an area of personal privacy essential to the maintenance of his human dignity‚Äù.&nbsp; Finally, in <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Borden</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145, it was found that where there is no statutory authorization for the seizure of bodily samples, consent must be obtained if the seizure is to be lawful.&nbsp; Here the police knew they were dealing with a young offender.

Langlois</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp.&nbsp;180-81, this Court unanimously recognized that the common law power of search incidental to arrest was a legitimate means by which those rights and obligations were to be carried out:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">In general, despite certain comments in scholarly discussion, it seems beyond question that the common law as recognized and developed in Canada holds that <u>the police have a power to search a lawfully arrested person and to seize anything in his or her possession or immediate surroundings</u> to guarantee the safety of the police and the accused, prevent the prisoner's escape or <u>provide evidence against him</u>.&nbsp; The common thread in this line of authority is the objective of guaranteeing safety and applying the law effectively.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

Storrey</i>, [1990] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 241, at p.&nbsp;254:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In fact, in deciding whether the police may exercise its power to arrest, one of the factors to be considered is ‚Äúthe need ...to secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence‚Äù (R.&nbsp;E.

Herman, ‚ÄúThe Unexplored Relationship Between the Privilege Against Compulsory Self-Incrimination and the Involuntary Confession Rule (Part I)‚Äù (1992), 53 <i>Ohio St. L.J.</i> 101.&nbsp; They rest on the premise that a suspect cannot be coerced to give evidence against himself or herself.&nbsp; The suspect has the right to <u>choose</u> whether to make a statement or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to choose whether or not to make a statement which may be used in evidence against oneself is a right that lies at the heart of the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; It was this right that&nbsp; led this Court in <i>Hebert</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>to conclude that the confessions rule at common law could reasonably be viewed as excluding statements obtained through police trickery.&nbsp; It was not suggested, however, that the principle against self-incrimination had any application outside the realm of testimonial evidence.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">202<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>Professor Paciocco offers three reasons for the distinction that the common law has drawn between testimonial evidence and real evidence.&nbsp; The first relates to the reliability of the information provided.&nbsp; The primary function of evidence is to produce correct determinations of fact.&nbsp; Testimonial evidence is more likely to be misleading than real evidence.&nbsp; The prohibition of threats and promises running throughout the confessions cases is frequently linked to the danger that confessions obtained by these means may be inaccurate and may lead to the ultimate bane of any civilized system -- the conviction of an innocent person.&nbsp; Additional dangers of testimonial evidence include the possibility that the witness was mistaken, that the witness‚Äôs recollection may be faulty, that misunderstanding may arise through incomplete or inarticulate wording of testimony, and that the witness may be deliberately lying.&nbsp; None of these dangers exist with real evidence, where the physical thing is available for examination and, in many cases, may be directly observed by the trier of fact: <i>R. v. Nikolovski</i>,<i> </i>[1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197, <i>per </i>Cory J.&nbsp; It is thus not surprising, Professor Paciocco opines, ‚Äúto find absolute rules of exclusion related to compelled testimonial evidence, but not to rules about the proof of real evidence‚Äù (p. 87).</p>

line-height:24.4pt">203<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>The second reason for the common law‚Äôs refusal to extend rules protecting against self-incrimination to non-testimonial evidence concerns the causal connection between improper police conduct and the evidence.&nbsp; In the case of testimonial evidence, the causal connection is direct.&nbsp; The confession would not have existed ‚Äúbut for‚Äù the improper pressure, inducement or exploitation of the accused.&nbsp; The wrongful act, in a very real sense, creates the information, which would not have existed without it.&nbsp; This is not the case with real evidence.&nbsp; Real evidence -- be it the murder weapon or the accused‚Äôs blood -- exists independently of the police conduct.&nbsp; Even where real evidence&nbsp; would not have been found ‚Äúbut for‚Äù the improper conduct of the police, the evidence it reveals is usually there to be discovered.&nbsp; For example, in the case at bar, had the police not taken the appellant‚Äôs hair, dental imprint or discarded tissue, the DNA evidence and the evidence of his bite which they produced&nbsp; would have still existed, and quite possibly have been discovered by the police in a more legitimate way.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Court has held that the independent existence and ultimate discoverability of real evidence may lead to its admission when a statement taken in similar circumstances is excluded: <i>R. v. Black</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138, <i>per</i> Wilson J. for the unanimous Court.&nbsp; The distinction is necessary since to exclude the real evidence in such a case would ‚Äúaccomplish more than perfect <i>restitutio in integrum</i> between the parties; by causing the state to lose the evidence completely, it may well be put in a position that is worse than if the constitutional violation had never occurred‚Äù (Paciocco, <i>supra</i>, at p. 88).&nbsp; Where the real evidence is obtained as a result of an involuntary statement it may attract derivative testimonial privilege provided it would not have been otherwise discoverable.&nbsp; But this does not negate the fact that real evidence generally exists independently of police misconduct.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">... there is something in the nature of the seizure of the information stored in the memory of an accused person which makes it more reprehensible than the taking of real or physical evidence from his or her person.&nbsp; By its very nature that which is in the mind of the accused person is more private than that which is physically possessed.&nbsp; It is certainly less accessible.&nbsp; What exists can usually be observed by a third party without a willed act of participation by the accused.&nbsp; Physical characteristics used to identify an accused and the possession of objects by the accused can be observed without his or her participation.&nbsp; Even bodily specimens can be forcibly taken from an accused who continues to resist.&nbsp; Information stored in the recesses of the mind can become available for use against the accused, however, only through an act of the accused.&nbsp; He or she must be a full participant in its creation by making a conscious decision to speak.&nbsp; In this sense, the seizure of involuntary statements involves an overbearing of the will of the individual to resist and conscripts the accused in a way that the seizure of physical evidence does not.&nbsp; It is an act of the self which ultimately leads to the evidence.&nbsp; The privacy of the mind, the last refuge of the individual, is invaded with the enforced complicity of the accused.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">205<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>These reasons for the common law confinement of the principle against self-incrimination to testimonial evidence may be supplemented by a fourth.&nbsp; To render illegal the compelled use of the accused‚Äôs body in gathering evidence against the accused would be to render inadmissible many kinds of evidence which have long been routinely admitted.&nbsp; The identification witness who says, ‚ÄúI recognize the man in the prisoner‚Äôs box as the person I saw at the scene of the crime‚Äù, is using the accused‚Äôs body against him.&nbsp; Standard police techniques such as photographing the accused or requiring him to appear in an identification line-up similarly depend on using the accused‚Äôs body against him, usually without consent.&nbsp; The principle against self-incrimination provides no means to distinguish between the police photo and more serious incursions of the suspect‚Äôs body.&nbsp; The principle of protection against unreasonable search and seizure, on the other hand, provides such means.&nbsp; The principle against self-incrimination applied to physical evidence is a blunt tool, requiring either distortion or supplementation if it is to operate fairly and practically.&nbsp; The principle against unreasonable search and seizure, by contrast, evokes a body of jurisprudence aimed at aiding the court in making the necessary distinctions between permissible use of the suspect‚Äôs body and impermissible use of the suspect‚Äôs body.&nbsp; For this reason, Holmes J. in <i>Holt v. United States</i>, 218 U.S. 245 (1910), referred to the argument that evidence of an accused‚Äôs non-consensual modelling of a blouse violated the privilege against self-incrimination as ‚Äúan extravagant extension of the Fifth Amendment‚Äù (p. 252).</p>

McLellan</i>, [1974] V.R. 773, the Supreme Court of Victoria rejected the argument that compelled provision of a breath sample violates the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; It quoted (at pp. 776-77) the aforementioned passage from Wigmore:</p>

Taking hair samples, buccal swabs or dental impressions is far more intrusive than fingerprinting or photographing.&nbsp; The common law has never permitted such methods of identification.&nbsp; Having acted outside the apparent authority of the law, it is difficult to contend that the police acted reasonably.</p>

Elshaw</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 24, and approved unanimously in <i>R. v. Broyles</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595.&nbsp; However, in each of these cases the Court went on to consider the other two groups of factors.&nbsp; This seemed, on the whole, consistent with the statement in <i>Collins</i> that ‚Äú[i]f the admission of the evidence in some way affects the fairness of the trial, then the admission of the evidence would <u>tend</u> to bring the administration of justice into disrepute and, subject to a consideration of the other factors, the evidence generally should be excluded‚Äù (p. 284 (emphasis in original)).</p>

line-height:24.4pt">253<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>I turn next to the expanded notion of self-incrimination which underlies the new approach.&nbsp; The common law and post-<i>Charter</i> cases up to and beyond <i>Collins</i> drew a sharp distinction between testimonial and real evidence when it came to questions of admissibility.&nbsp; As has been seen, the principle against self-incrimination applied only to testimonial evidence, that is, to statements given to the police or the court.&nbsp; This distinction was drawn, as discussed, for principled reasons.&nbsp; It was maintained in <i>Collins</i>, where Lamer J. wrote: ‚Äú[r]eal evidence that was obtained in a manner that violated the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> will rarely operate unfairly for that reason alone‚Äù (p. 284).&nbsp; More recent cases on the way to the new, automatic exclusion approach, however, have suggested that this distinction may be misplaced.&nbsp; In <i>Burlingham</i>, Iacobucci J. wrote at para. 30 that ‚Äúthis Court has consistently shied away from the differential treatment of real evidence‚Äù.&nbsp; And in <i>R. v. Colarusso</i>,<i> </i>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 20, at p. 74, La Forest J. opined that ‚Äúthe mere fact that the impugned evidence is classified as either real or conscriptive should not in and of itself be determinative of the admissibility of the evidence‚Äù.&nbsp; Following this approach, the majority on this appeal treats the real evidence taken from the accused‚Äôs body as if it were testimonial evidence to which the principle against self-incrimination applies.&nbsp; The common law confessions rule may be taken as holding that admission of involuntary conscripted <u>testimonial</u> evidence is presumptively unfair, justifying an absolute exclusionary rule.&nbsp; By obliterating the distinction between testimonial and real evidence the new automatic exclusionary approach extends this presumption to all conscripted real evidence.&nbsp; Any real evidence taken from, or by the use of, the accused‚Äôs body without consent is deemed to affect the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; When this conclusion is combined with the assumption that any evidence that affects trial fairness must be excluded, the result is that any involuntary or ‚Äúconscripted‚Äù evidence involving the use of the accused‚Äôs body becomes inadmissible.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">266<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>Under the second group of factors relating to the seriousness of the violation, the seriousness of the affront to the appellant‚Äôs privacy and dignity would fall to be considered, as well as whether the police acted in good faith, whether there was a situation of urgency or necessity, whether other investigatory techniques were available and whether the evidence would have been obtained in any event.&nbsp; With respect to the seriousness of the affront to the appellant‚Äôs privacy and dignity, the trial judge found that the police infringement was ‚Äúas minor as possible‚Äù and&nbsp; ‚Äúnot serious‚Äù (paras. 53 and 54).&nbsp; Similarly, the majority in the Court of Appeal held that the samples were taken in a fashion which constituted a minimal affront to the appellant‚Äôs dignity and noted that the appellant did not resist.</p>
