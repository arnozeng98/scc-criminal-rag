   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Criminal law — Trial — Continuation of proceedings before another judge — Evidence — Admissibility — Legal framework governing admissibility in evidence in trial that is commenced again, as evidence on merits, of transcripts of testimony from first trial that have been filed with consent of parties — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s.&nbsp;669.2(3).</i></p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2012, the accused was charged with 18 counts of sexual offences committed between 1974 and 1993 that involved victims who were minors, including his daughter and his son. The hearing of the prosecution’s evidence began in March 2016 before a first judge of the Court of Québec. The daughter of the accused gave her testimony, both in chief and in cross‑examination. Then the accused suffered an attack and the case was postponed for a later date. During the period of the stay of proceedings, the judge fell ill. More than a year later, he was replaced and a new trial was scheduled to be held before another judge.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under s.&nbsp;669.2(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, if a trial commences again before a new judge sitting alone and no adjudication was made or verdict rendered, the new judge must commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken. In this case, counsel for the parties, by common agreement, filed the transcript of the testimony of the daughter of the accused in the record, and it was admitted by the new judge as evidence on the merits. Three other complainants then testified for the prosecution, and the judge found the accused guilty on 9 of the 18 counts. But the Court of Appeal concluded that the new judge should not have accepted that the testimony of the daughter of the accused be filed without ensuring that the consent of the accused was voluntary, informed and unequivocal and that the filing of the testimony in question would not undermine the fairness of the trial. It therefore ordered a new trial on the counts concerning the daughter of the accused (counts 1 and 2), but also on those relating to his son (counts 9 to 13), because one of the acts alleged against the accused concerned an incident involving both his daughter and his son.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: The appeal should be allowed and the convictions and the sentences on counts 1, 2 and 9 to 13 restored.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 669.2(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not bar a transcript of testimony given at a first trial from being filed as evidence on the merits in a second trial. There is no reason to require, as the Court of Appeal did, an inquiry that is not provided for by law where the parties have consented to the filing of the transcript. Such an inquiry would completely alter the judge’s role, minimize the judge’s ability to assess the transcript of prior testimony and run counter to the presumption of the competence of counsel. Absent evidence to the contrary, waiver of a procedural right by counsel for an accused is presumed to be intentional.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grammatical and ordinary sense of the words of s.&nbsp;669.2 is clear and Parliament’s intention is evident. Where a trial is by judge alone, the new judge must commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken and may not require the parties, or one of them, to file evidence from the first trial. But because the section concerns jurisdiction and not evidence, it does not preclude the application of the usual rules with respect to the presentation of evidence. At the outset of the second trial, both the prosecution and the defence are free to proceed as they see fit as regards the presentation of their evidence; they may elect to proceed by filing transcripts of prior testimony. This choice is a tactical decision that resembles other decisions of the same nature in which the judge need not intervene. For the transcript of testimony given at the first trial to be admitted in the second trial as evidence on the merits, all that is needed is that the transcript be duly filed and that the parties consent to its being filed.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, s.&nbsp;669.2 does not eliminate the judge’s residual discretion. As the gatekeeper for trial fairness, the judge retains at all times the power to inquire on his or her own initiative even where doing so is required neither by statute nor at common law. Where there are indications suggesting that the consent of the accused might be vitiated, the court should exercise its residual discretion and investigate further in order to ensure that the consent of the accused to the procedure is voluntary and informed. Section 669.2 does not eliminate the judge’s power not to allow a transcript to be filed if he or she finds that the prejudicial effect of filing it would undermine the fairness of the trial. A judge who finds that trial fairness is undermined must intervene.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the new judge did not unilaterally require the parties to file the transcripts from the first trial. The transcript of the testimony of the daughter of the accused was duly filed and the parties consented to its being filed. There were no indications that might have led the new judge to question the consent of the accused. The second trial of the accused was therefore fair.</p>

The key issue concerns the rules of evidence in a trial commenced again before a new judge sitting alone. The parties are asking this Court to rule on the legal framework governing the admissibility in evidence in a trial that is commenced again, as evidence on the merits, of transcripts of testimony from a first trial that have been filed by mutual consent.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par2">2</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 669.2(3) provides that the judge before whom the proceedings are continued must, if the trial was before a judge alone and no adjudication was made or verdict rendered, commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken. However, s.&nbsp;669.2 says nothing about whether evidence adduced before the first judge may be adduced as evidence on the merits in the trial that is commenced again.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par3">3</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it is common ground that such evidence can be filed at the trial that is commenced again, the parties disagree on the test to be applied when the prosecution and the accused consent to the filing of a transcript of testimony heard by the judge before whom the trial first commenced. The Quebec Court of Appeal, relying on the rule that testimony is conventionally given orally at trial, proposed a two-part inquiry. First, the court must — even if the accused is represented by counsel — determine whether the consent of the accused is voluntary, informed and unequivocal. Second, the court must ensure that the filing of the evidence will not undermine the fairness of the trial. The appellant, Her Majesty the Queen, has appealed to this Court, arguing that the Court of Appeal erred by requiring an inquiry that is not provided for by law.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par4">4</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With all due respect, I conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation and application of s.&nbsp;669.2. There is no reason to require an inquiry that is not provided for by law where the parties have consented to the filing, in a trial that was commenced again, of a transcript of testimony given at a first trial. Such an inquiry would completely alter the judge’s role, minimize the judge’s ability to assess the transcript of prior testimony and run counter to the presumption of the competence of counsel.</p>

Two of the complainants were his children C.D. and S.D., while the other two were his nephew and niece.</p>

C.D., the daughter of the accused, gave her testimony, both in chief and in cross‑examination, on March 29 and 30. On March 30, 2016, the respondent suffered an attack, and the case was postponed for a later date. During the period of the stay of proceedings, Judge Beaulieu fell ill.</p>

A new trial was scheduled to begin on September 18, 2017 before Judge Paul Chevalier.</p>

On June 16, 2017, the coordinating judge for the district sent a letter to counsel for the parties that noted their consent to having the transcript of C.D.’s testimony given to the new judge. As a result, counsel for the parties, by common agreement, filed the transcript of C.D.’s testimony in the record. At the opening of the second trial, on September 18, 2017, counsel for the defence reiterated his consent and the transcript of C.D.’s testimony was admitted by Judge Chevalier as evidence on the merits.</p>

The Court of Appeal relied on <i>Gauthier v. R.</i>, 2020 QCCA 751, and <i>Jetté v. R.</i>, 2020 QCCA 750, in which it had ordered new trials in contexts similar to the one in the case at bar. In <i>Gauthier</i> and <i>Jetté</i>, the Court of Appeal had held that the accused may consent to the filing of evidence that was adduced before the first judge. However, the new judge must not accept that the testimony be filed in the record unless satisfied that the consent of the accused is voluntary, informed and unequivocal. The new judge must also be satisfied that filing the evidence that was adduced before the first judge will not undermine the fairness of the trial.</p>

If he was not satisfied in this regard, he should not have allowed the evidence in question to be filed as evidence on the merits and should have commenced the trial again in its entirety. In the Court of Appeal’s view, even though the evidence adduced before the first judge was limited to C.D.’s testimony, it was important evidence in a case in which credibility was key.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

(counts 1 and 2), but also on those relating to S.D. (counts 9 to 13), because one of the acts alleged against the respondent concerned an incident involving both C.D. and S.D. C.D.’s testimony was a factor relevant to the assessment of the credibility of the respondent and of S.D., because C.D. had contradicted the respondent and corroborated S.D.’s testimony. [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “It would therefore be dangerous to affirm the convictions relating to [S.D.] if the trial judge did not hear [C.D.]’s testimony” (para.&nbsp;41). As a result, a motion to set aside the sentences on counts 1 and 2 with respect to C.D. and on counts 9 to 13 with respect to S.D. was also granted.</p>

It nonetheless held that the judge at the second trial must conduct a two‑part inquiry. First, that judge must ask whether the consent given by the accused to the filing in evidence of a transcript in lieu of testimony was voluntary, informed and unequivocal. Second, the judge must ensure that admitting prior testimony in evidence will not undermine the fairness of the trial.</p>

A new judge presiding a jury trial may continue the trial or commence the trial again, whereas a new judge sitting alone is required to commence the trial again. In the first case, the trial can continue without undermining trial fairness, because the “trier of facts”, the jury, is not replaced. The situation is different, however, in the case of a trial by judge alone. Because such a judge is both the judge of the law and the trier of facts, the trial cannot simply be resumed at the same place before a new judge (<i>Gauthier</i>, at para.&nbsp;55 (CanLII)). On the contrary, to require the parties to continue the trial would amount to a breach of procedural fairness.</p>

It seems clear from this amendment that Parliament wanted to distinguish the two modes of trial. Parliament’s intention is evident: where a trial is by judge alone and must be commenced again before a new judge, that judge may not require the parties, or one of them, to file evidence from the first trial. The trial must absolutely be commenced again.</p>

The parties may take the conventional approach, the one based on the view that “[t]he law has .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. favoured the evidence of witnesses who give evidence in court because they can be observed” (<i>R. v. Youvarajah</i>, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at para.&nbsp;19). But the parties may also elect — usually without having to justify their decision — to proceed by filing transcripts of prior testimony. Indeed, the Court of Appeal recognized this in saying that [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “the accused may consent to the filing of evidence that was adduced before the first judge” (para.&nbsp;33; see also <i>Gauthier</i>, at para.&nbsp;57; <i>R. v. A.A.</i>, 2012 ONSC 3270, at paras.&nbsp;77‑78 (CanLII)).</p>

With respect, I am of the view that it erred by requiring a test that is not provided for by law, as is clear from an analysis of the scheme of the <i>Criminal&nbsp;Code</i>. When Parliament intends to require that a judge conduct an inquiry, it does so explicitly. For example, s.&nbsp;606(1.1) of the <i>Criminal&nbsp;Code</i> specifically sets out the factors the court must verify before accepting a guilty plea. It is because of the finality of a guilty plea and its extremely serious consequences — the accused forgoes a trial as well as the presentation of the prosecution’s case against him or her — that the judge must ensure the plea is voluntary, unequivocal and informed (<i>R. v. Wong</i>, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at paras.&nbsp;2‑3; <i>Dallaire v. R.</i>, 2021 QCCA 785, at para.&nbsp;17 (CanLII)).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par28">28</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But there is no justification for transposing such an inquiry to a context like the one in the instant case. Electing to file a transcript of testimony from a previous trial does not have the same implications. Although proceeding in this way is not the conventional approach, it is in no way exceptional. This is a tactical decision that resembles other decisions of the same nature, such as choosing to cross‑examine a witness, consent to certain admissions or waive a <i>voir dire</i> (<i>Park v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 64, at pp.&nbsp;73‑75; <i>R. v. White</i> (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 722 (C.A.), at p.&nbsp;751). All such decisions can of course have major repercussions on the outcome of a trial, but they do not require preventive intervention by the court. For example, in analogous circumstances, the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated that “[w]here both Crown and defence counsel agree that hearsay evidence is admissible, the judge is not <u>required</u><i> </i>to embark on an independent inquiry to determine whether their positions are legally sound” (<i>R. v. Verma</i>, 2016 BCCA 220, 336 C.C.C. (3d) 441, at para.&nbsp;38 (emphasis added)).</p>

The only function of s.&nbsp;669.2(3) is to require a judge sitting alone to commence the trial again. Once the judge has done so, the parties have control over the presentation of their own evidence. Therefore, for the transcript of testimony given at the first trial to be admitted in the second trial as evidence on the merits, all that is needed is that the transcript be duly filed and that the parties consent to its being filed (<i>Matheson v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 214, at pp.&nbsp;217‑18).</p>

Not only does the judge need not do so, but he or she should in fact refrain from intervening. This Court recently noted the deference owed to counsel in regard to tactical decisions made in the best interests of the client:</p>
   <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.2pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our adversarial system does accord a high degree of deference to the tactical decisions of counsel. In other words, while courts may sanction the conduct of the litigants, they should generally refrain from interfering with the conduct of the litigation<i> </i>itself. In <i>R. v.</i> <i>S.G.T.</i>,<i> </i>2010 SCC 20, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras.&nbsp;36‑37, this Court explained why judges should be very cautious before interfering with tactical decisions:</p>
   <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an adversarial system of criminal trials, trial judges must, barring exceptional circumstances, defer to the tactical decisions of counsel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [C]ounsel will generally be in a better position to assess the wisdom, in light of their overall trial strategy, of a particular tactical decision than is the trial judge. By contrast, trial judges are expected to be impartial arbiters of the dispute before them; the more a trial judge second‑guesses or overrides the decisions of counsel, the greater is the risk that the trial judge will, in either appearance or reality, cease being a neutral arbiter and instead become an advocate for one party.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

R.V.</i>, 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para.&nbsp;75). As the gatekeeper for trial fairness, the judge retains at all times the power to inquire on his or her own initiative even where doing so is required neither by statute nor at common law. Where there are indications suggesting that the consent of the accused might be vitiated, the court should exercise its residual discretion and investigate further in order to ensure that the consent of the accused to the procedure is voluntary and informed (<i>Gauthier</i>; <i>Jetté</i>).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

In that case, the defence had announced — after all the evidence had been called and all that remained was to render the verdict — that the accused could not afford to have the trial commence again in its entirety owing to a lack of financial resources. In this way, the accused was consenting to all the transcripts from the first trial being filed as evidence on the merits before the judge charged with commencing the trial again and rendering judgment. The Court of Appeal, having indications before it that suggested that the consent of the accused had not been voluntary and informed, ordered a new trial. Because the trial judge had not inquired further into the consent of the accused, the fairness of the trial had been undermined. This leads to the inference that had there been no such indications, an inquiry would probably not have been necessary.</p>

This Court is therefore not required to determine whether the trial judge’s duty to a self‑represented accused would be different.</span> Allow me nonetheless to digress by making a few comments, although without ruling definitively on this issue. In the case of a self‑represented accused, the court has a duty to ensure that the accused can have a fair trial that is respectful of his or her fundamental rights. The judge is at that time [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “charged with a particular responsibility” to ensure that the trial is fair (<i>R. v. Leblanc</i>, 2010 QCCA 1891, 78 C.R. (6th) 359, at para.&nbsp;47). The judge has, in this sense, a duty to assist the accused (<i>Guenette v. R.</i>, 2002 CanLII 7883 (Que. C.A.), at para.&nbsp;20; <i>R. v. Richards</i>, 2017 ONCA 424, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 284, at para.&nbsp;110). This duty to assist is [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “variable”, however, as it differs according to the circumstances and is limited to what is reasonable (<i>M.R. v. R.</i>, 2018 QCCA 1983, 53 C.R. (7th) 182, at para.&nbsp;25, citing<i> Jarrah v. R.</i>, 2017 QCCA 1869, and <i>R. v. Breton</i>, 2018 ONCA 753, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 281, at para.&nbsp;13; see also<i> Richards</i>, at paras.&nbsp;110‑11). Although the court is not required to give advice to the accused, it must be reasonably certain that the accused is aware of his or her procedural rights. It could be necessary in such circumstances to inquire further into the consent of the accused. I will now return to the matter at hand.</p>

24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par40">40</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the accused had refused to consent to the filing of the transcript of C.D.’s testimony, the prosecution would have had no choice but to have C.D. testify again (there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the prosecution could not have called her again) or to abandon that evidence. As well, Judge Chevalier could not himself have forced the accused to consent to the filing of the transcript as evidence on the merits, especially given that no exception to the hearsay rule had been raised. What is more, the accused could have withdrawn his consent either before Judge Chevalier or on appeal by claiming, for example, ineffective assistance of his counsel.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par41">41</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But that did not happen. In all likelihood, the accused, on his counsel’s advice, considered that it was to his advantage to consent to the filing of the transcript. I would add that at no time did the accused cast any doubt on his consent to proceeding in this way. It was not even included among his grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal. Before being invited by the Court of Appeal to make submissions on this point, the accused never suggested that his consent to the filing of the transcript of C.D.’s testimony was vitiated or, at the very least, that he had changed his mind.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par42">42</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the situation in <i>Gauthier</i>, there were no indications in the instant case that might have led Judge Chevalier to question the consent of the accused. When he received the parties’ consent, he was satisfied that the fairness of the trial was assured. The fact that Judge Chevalier presumed that the consent of the accused was valid does not constitute procedural unfairness. On the contrary, it is consistent with the guiding principles of criminal procedure.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par43">43</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that, because the transcript of C.D.’s testimony was [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “important evidence in a case in which credibility was key”, Judge Chevalier should not have admitted it without ensuring that the respondent’s consent was voluntary, informed and unequivocal and that its filing would not undermine the fairness of the trial (para.&nbsp;37). Conducting a defence necessarily involves making tactical decisions in which the judge need not intervene, especially when the accused is duly represented by counsel. The fact that credibility is in issue changes nothing in this case.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par44">44</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the appellant explains, [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “[t]he effect of the Court of Appeal’s decision is that it is hard, if not impossible, to imagine a case in which the judge before whom a trial commences again can admit in evidence a transcript of testimony of a victim of a crime whose credibility is in issue. Only ancillary testimony would be compatible with the stated conditions. The Court of Appeal is practically prohibiting an accused from consenting to the filing of such evidence upon the resumption of the trial” (A.F., at para.&nbsp;48).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par45">45</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the counts with respect to S.D., I find that the Court of Appeal also erred in ordering a new trial solely on the basis that C.D.’s testimony was a relevant factor in the assessment of the acts committed against S.D.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par46">46</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.D.’s testimony was not necessary in order to find the accused guilty on the counts involving S.D. In assessing the evidence with respect to S.D., Judge Chevalier used the transcript of C.D.’s testimony to only a limited extent. And that limited use did not have the effect of vitiating all of the findings of fact (independent of C.D.’s testimony) Judge Chevalier reached.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par47">47</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from Judge Chevalier’s reasons that he was satisfied, independently of C.D.’s corroboration — which, as I said, was not necessary — that the assaults alleged by S.D. actually took place. Judge Chevalier stated that he believed S.D. [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “because of the consistency between what he said and the accounts he had given previously, because of the lack of any sort of collusion with his sister, whom he even contradicted at times, and because of the objectivity he displayed in testifying, despite the contradictions by the accused and Ms.&nbsp;G., regarding the photos in particular” (para.&nbsp;115 (CanLII)). Judge Chevalier then added that he “believes [S.D.]’s testimony and is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the other types of sexual assault he experienced .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the descriptions of which are very detailed, took place” (para.&nbsp;118). As a result, [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “[t]his limited corroboration could not cast doubt on the conclusion concerning S.D.’s credibility” (A.F., at para.&nbsp;104).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par48">48</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, because the parties had agreed to proceed with the filing of the transcript of C.D.’s testimony, Judge Chevalier had only to determine the weight to be given to it. The absence of C.D. at trial goes to the weight of her testimony, not to its admissibility (<i>R. v. Hawkins</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, at para.&nbsp;79). The Court of Appeal should not have questioned the valid consent of the accused, which resulted from the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. That tactical decision by his counsel “[fell] within the wide latitude afforded counsel in the conduct of the case” (I.F., at para.&nbsp;13).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

The accused has appealed to this Court on only a single issue and has neither reiterated nor stressed the other grounds he raised in the Court of Appeal. To return the case to that court would not be an efficient use of judicial resources.</p>
