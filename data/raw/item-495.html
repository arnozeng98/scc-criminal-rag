&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> was held to determine the admissibility of alleged previous acts of sexual misconduct by the appellant against the complainant.&nbsp; The Crown wished to present the complainant's allegations of numerous incidents of sexual fondling and intercourse from December 1978 to May 1981, and further incidents of sexual touching in December 1983 and in the spring of 1985.&nbsp; The appellant had faced several charges, including incest, arising from the incidents alleged prior to May 1981, but the Crown had entered a stay of proceedings in 1982 on all of the charges.&nbsp; Defence counsel did not object to the admission of the allegations of the incidents on May 30, 1981, in December 1983 and in the spring of 1985.&nbsp; The trial judge excluded the evidence of the alleged incidents prior to May 30, 1981 due to an insufficient logical connection between this evidence and the July 1985 incidents.&nbsp; Even if it was relevant, the probative value of the similar fact evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect to the appellant.&nbsp; He added, however, that the evidence could become relevant as a result of questions asked in cross‚Äëexamination of Crown witnesses.</span></p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge erred, however, in admitting the evidence of the alleged sexual misconduct between 1978 and May 1981 following the cross‚Äëexamination of the complainant's mother.&nbsp; The evidence had not changed its character and remained evidence of alleged prior sexual misconduct which could only be admitted if it satisfied the similar fact evidence rule.&nbsp; While the evidence had acquired some relevance for correcting the false impression being left in the minds of the jury, this added relevance did not diminish the prejudicial effect of that evidence.&nbsp; Thus, the unfortunate situation created by the cross‚Äëexamination did not alter the balance sufficiently to render the evidence admissible.&nbsp; If the trial judge was of the view that an immediate caution to the jury to disregard the evidence was insufficient to ensure a fair trial, then his course was to direct a mistrial rather than admit the evidence of similar acts which had previously been excluded.&nbsp; Since the trial judge erred in admitting this evidence, the trial judge's charge need not be considered in relation to that evidence.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; The application of the similar facts rule requires a balancing of factors and involves an exercise of discretion on the part of the trial judge who must assess both the probative value and the possible prejudicial effect of the evidence in the circumstances of the case before him.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge could have validly admitted the evidence from the outset.&nbsp; The probative force of the evidence outweighed the prejudicial effect upon the appellant.&nbsp; In determining whether a father has sexually assaulted his daughter, it is particularly relevant to know whether such behaviour is part of a long‚Äëstanding pattern of abuse.</span></p>
