The group returned to the couple’s home early in the morning.&nbsp; After more drinking and socializing, D and a friend rode on motorcycles on search for another party, leaving M in the house, dancing by herself to music which was playing on the computer. D returned around five in the morning.&nbsp; The house was locked and neighbours heard him cursing and trying to get into the house and his vehicles.&nbsp; Later in the morning, M was found in the kitchen, dead from a stab wound.&nbsp; D was found drunk in a bedroom and arrested for murder.&nbsp; At trial, D testified that, due to his alcohol consumption on that night, he was unable to remember the events that took place after he arrived home.&nbsp; Many witnesses testified about D’s state of drunkenness before and after the killing.&nbsp; An expert witness was called by the defence and testified about the effect of alcohol on judgment and brain function.&nbsp; The jury found D guilty of second degree murder and this verdict was upheld by the majority of the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; At issue here are the adequacy of the trial judge’s instruction on the defence of intoxication and whether the trial judge had to give a specific instruction on proof beyond reasonable doubt with respect to the credibility of the accused.</span></p>

The house was locked and neighbours heard him cursing and trying to get into the house and his vehicles which were parked around the house.&nbsp; The next morning, Ms. Manchur, was found by her sister‑in‑law lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen and dining area of the house, dead from a stab wound and naked from the waist down.&nbsp; Mr. Daley was found drunk in a bedroom.&nbsp; He was charged with first degree murder.</p>

C‑46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, on the grounds that there was a dissent in the Court of Appeal on a question of law only.&nbsp; A number of deficiencies with the charge on the defence of drunkenness were raised by the dissenting judge.&nbsp; By and large, however, the essence of Smith J.A.’s dissent lies in a disagreement with the majority about the nature and significance of the testimony of the defence expert, Dr. Richardson.&nbsp; This is arguably a disagreement on a question of fact, at worst, or at best, on a question of mixed fact and law.&nbsp; That disagreement led to vastly different conclusions by the majority and dissent as to the proper application of the rules regarding the trial judge’s duty to relate the evidence to the law in jury instructions.&nbsp; In my view, the disagreement between the majority and dissent in the Court of Appeal over the nature and significance of the expert evidence was so crucial to Smith J.A.’s dissent that it raises the question as to whether there was in fact a dissent on a question of law.&nbsp; It seems to me that had there been no disagreement on the substance of Dr. Richardson’s evidence, no error would have been found against the trial judge in relating the evidence to the law.&nbsp; If there is a question of law in this case, it must be the extent to which the trial judge must review and interpret evidence presented at trial, in particular expert evidence, for the jury.&nbsp; In this respect, I find that Smith J.A. imposed a greater obligation on the trial judge than the law demands, and in fact exceeded the bounds of appellate review by reading into Dr. Richardson’s testimony evidence that clearly was not there; this is what led her, erroneously in my view, to find fault with the trial judge’s instructions.</p>

Long‑term memory we don’t know where it is specifically.&nbsp; Long‑term memory is still a mystery what the mechanism of that.&nbsp; But the same cells that are [in]volved in the judgement and appropriate – the evaluation of appropriateness of behaviours, thoughts and ideas are also involved in this transfer from short‑term memory into long‑term memory.

It follows that the jury must be instructed to take into account the evidence of the accused’s consumption of alcohol or drugs, along with all the other evidence which is relevant to the accused’s intent, in determining whether, in all the circumstances, it would be appropriate to draw the permissible inference that the accused intended the natural consequences of his actions.</p>

Berrigan </i>(1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 120 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 13-14, and <i>R. v. Hannon</i> (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 86, 2001 BCCA 566.&nbsp; In the latter case it was held that “where a central realistic issue was whether the accused was intoxicated such that he knew it was likely that the bodily harm would cause death, a clear and specific linkage in the charge was required” (para. 9).&nbsp; These cases rely on the following passage in <i>Seymour</i> to ground their finding of a mandatory duty to link intoxication and foreseeability:</p>

20.85pt;line-height:200%">One of the effects of severe intoxication is an inability to foresee the consequences of one’s actions, much less intend them.&nbsp; It was for this reason that the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>MacKinlay</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 322, held that the <a name="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></a>state of mind required to commit the crime described in s. 229(<i>a</i>)(ii) involves an ability on the part of the accused to measure or foresee the consequences of his act and that, therefore, the jury should consider whether intoxication affected his ability to have the required foresight.

Simpson</i> (1999), 125 B.C.A.C. 44, 1999 BCCA 310, at para. 38:</p>

Demeter</i> (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 417 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 436, aff’d on other grounds, [1978] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 538, to the effect that non-direction on a matter of evidence constitutes a reversible error <i>only</i> where the single item of evidence in question is the foundation of the defence: see <i>Young v.

I am satisfied, however, that on a functional review of the charge, the jury properly understood that one of the main questions before them was whether Mr. Daley was so intoxicated that he could not foresee that stabbing Ms. Manchur would result in her death.&nbsp; This was conveyed by Kyle J.’s repeated reference to the state of mind to be proven by the Crown as “the intent to kill <u>or the intent to cause bodily harm knowing that it was likely to cause the death</u>”, which he emphasized they could only come to after considering Mr. Daley’s consumption of alcohol&nbsp; and the rest of the evidence that threw light on his state of mind.&nbsp; The reference to “knowing that it was likely to&nbsp; cause the death” is but another way to describe foreseeing that the consequences of one’s actions will result in death.&nbsp; It is a common phrase that is used to convey the intent required by s. 229(<i>a</i>)(ii): see <i>CRIMJI: Canadian Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (4th ed. 2005), Special Direction 4—Second Degree Murder—Intent—Knowledge—Drunkenness, at p. 8.36-11.</p>

The next morning his sister Elissa came into the house and found Teanda dead on the floor of the dining room in circumstances that have been fully described to you.&nbsp; She and her father George, when he came, found Wayne asleep and with great difficulty George awakened him.&nbsp; Police were called [and an] ambulance arrived.&nbsp; The presence of police, ambulance attendants, George and Elissa may have disturbed the scene but it seems they were all careful.&nbsp; The professionals were professional, and we have quite detailed evidence of what they found.&nbsp; There is no evidence of there being anyone in the house other than Teanda and Wayne and as she died violently from a stab wound there is a strong implication that Wayne caused her death and that in so doing he acted unlawfully.&nbsp; The more difficult questions remain, did he intend to kill her.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; A.R., at pp. 13-15.]</p>

While Dr. Richardson did not have to testify that someone in Mr. Daley’s state of intoxication would lack “specific intent” for murder for his testimony to be relevant to the central issue in the case, he had to clearly convey that someone in Mr. Daley’s state could not foresee the consequences of his actions.&nbsp; He failed to do so.&nbsp; Indeed, Smith J.A. acknowledged that the evidence was less than clear: “It is unfortunate that the gist of Dr. Richardson’s evidence did not emerge as clearly as it could have from his testimony, particularly his evidence-in-chief” (para. 129).</p>

Tipewan</i>, [1998] S.J. No. 681 (QL) (Q.B.), where Dr. Richardson, testifying as an expert for the defence, had expressly linked loss of judgment with loss of the ability to foresee consequences.&nbsp; While I acknowledge that Smith J.A. prefaced her reliance on this case by noting “one must exercise extreme caution when comparing the evidence adduced in another case” (para. 140), I am of the view that it was improper for her to rely on the evidence in another case to prop-up the evidence in this case.&nbsp; The significance of Dr. Richardson’s testimony in this case is a question of fact. Subject to judicial notice, the answer to a question of fact, as it rests wholly on the evidence in a particular case, cannot be presumed to be true for any situation outside the specific one before the trial court.&nbsp; Also, the trial judge could hardly be criticized for dealing only with the evidence in front of him; that is the only evidence that could properly be put to the jury.</p>

Because what clearly came out of Dr. Richardson’s testimony was not particularly helpful in determining the central issue of whether Mr. Daley lacked the requisite intent and because the sequence to be followed in a jury charge is generally a matter within the trial judge’s discretion, I find no error here.&nbsp; Had Dr. Richardson testified in clear terms to the extent that Smith J.A. attributes to him, I would have serious concerns about the adequacy of the summary and presentation of this evidence, but the evidence was lacking and appellate courts should not attempt to fill in the gaps or make inferences that end up changing the evidence that the jury is to consider.</p>

(3) Persons in a state of alcoholic amnesia experience a shut down of judgment and the ability to evaluate the appropriateness of actions.&nbsp; (4) Persons whose judgment is no longer functioning are unable to foresee the likely consequences of their actions.&nbsp; (5) Persons who cannot foresee the likely consequences of their actions lack the specific intent to be found guilty of second degree murder.&nbsp; Counsel for Mr. Daley says that if all the propositions upon which the above theory is based are made out, then the evidence of amnesia must be central to his case.&nbsp; This is because the evidence in support of amnesia, if accepted, would bring one to the conclusion, by following the steps in the reasoning I set out above, that Mr. Daley lacked the requisite intent.</p>

Canute</i> (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 420.&nbsp; Moreover, even where a “common sense inference” direction might properly be considered relevant, the trial judge should instruct the jury that the more intoxicated accused persons are found to have been, the less likely it is that they foresaw — let alone intended — the “natural consequences” of their actions.</p>

Dr. Richardson gave this testimony in cross-examination in response to a question about one’s ability to plan for the next day.&nbsp; To the extent that further clarification was necessary, this response to Crown counsel clarified the meaning of Dr. Richardson’s evidence-in-chief.&nbsp; There was thus no need for the trial judge to <i>interpret</i> Dr. Richardson’s testimony, in the sense of determining what it meant <i>to him</i>.&nbsp; He was simply required to draw the jury’s attention to it since it related, manifestly, to the central issue in the case.</p>
