 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D killed a police officer by slashing his throat.&nbsp; The only issue at trial was whether D had the requisite intent for murder, or whether he was guilty of manslaughter.&nbsp; D was convicted of first degree murder.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately three weeks before trial, the jury panel lists were provided to both the Crown and the defence. The Crown sought the personal opinions of police officers from local police services regarding the suitability of prospective jurors, including any potential partiality for or against the Crown, for the purpose of exercising peremptory challenges.&nbsp; It was understood that police databases would not be used to check the lists, and that the comments were to be based on the officers’ knowledge of potential jurors in the community.&nbsp; One or two officers at each police service would review the lists and make general comments, such as “good”, “yes”, “ok” or “no”, or brief specific comments regarding relationships or roles in the community.&nbsp; The responses were compiled in a master list by an employee of the Crown office. &nbsp;Neither this list, nor the fact that inquiries had been made, was disclosed to the defence. &nbsp;Two of the jurors ultimately selected were noted as “good” and “ok” by the police services.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D appealed his conviction, alleging errors in the charge to the jury.&nbsp; While the appeal was pending, D requested and received the annotated jury panel lists.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal allowed the fresh evidence on the jury vetting issue, but ultimately dismissed the appeal, concluding that the police opinions were not “information” that was required to be disclosed; that the early release of the jury panel lists did not impact trial fairness; that the privacy rights of prospective jurors were not breached; and that the jury would not have been differently constituted if there had been disclosure of the police comments.&nbsp; Only the jury vetting issue has been appealed to this Court.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: &nbsp;The appeal should be dismissed.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Informal consultation with police officers must be approached with caution and the Crown should not engage in systematic consultations with police services regarding the suitability of jurors given the real risk that such inquiries could represent access to an informal database of the contacts a prospective juror has had with the police services and the criminal justice system.&nbsp; However, for the purpose of exercising its discretion in the peremptory challenge process, the Crown is permitted to ask the opinion of someone who is part of the prosecution team, or to consult with those assisting the prosecution, including individual police officers, regarding concerns relating to partiality, eligibility, or suitability of any prospective juror.&nbsp; Provided that any relevant information is disclosed, consultation that is limited to a few individual police officers does not, in itself, create an imbalance or an appearance of unfairness.&nbsp;Nor does it <span style="line-height:200%">represent an unjustified invasion of juror privacy</span>. &nbsp;It is consistent with the duty to uphold an impartial and competent jury.&nbsp; It is consistent with the right to exercise discretionary challenges.&nbsp; It is consistent with the rules of professional conduct.&nbsp; And it is consistent with consultation conducted by the defence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Crown seeks the opinion of a police officer, any information received relevant to the selection process (touching on a potential juror’s eligibility, suitability, or ability to remain impartial) must be disclosed. &nbsp;However, general impressions, personal or public knowledge in the community, rumours or hunches, need not be disclosed.&nbsp; To the extent that the underlying information is readily ascertainable by members of the community, it is not linked to the prosecution’s role as an agent of the state, or to the Crown’s disproportionate access to resources, and there is no onus on the Crown to bring forward information that is readily obtainable elsewhere. &nbsp;This is not to say that the Crown is required to disclose the opinions of police along with the information on which those opinions are based.&nbsp; So long as the underlying information is disclosed, the defence will have access to the material on which the opinion is based, and can draw its own inferences for the purpose of exercising its peremptory challenges. &nbsp;However, where a police officer has knowledge, whether derived from her role as an officer or as a member of the community, that is relevant to the jury selection process, she must disclose it.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assessment of the impact of a failure to disclose required under the <i>Dixon </i>test should be modified when the undisclosed information bears upon the choice of the trier of fact, rather than the merits of the case.&nbsp; Where the integrity of the choice of the trier of fact is at stake, the court must ask: first, whether the information ought to have been disclosed; and second, had the information been disclosed, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury would have been differently constituted.&nbsp; If not, trial fairness has not been compromised and the defence has not been prejudiced. &nbsp;Where non‑disclosure interferes with the accused’s use of his peremptory challenges to the extent that there is a reasonable possibility that the jury would have been differently constituted, this safeguard is undermined and the presumption that the jury is impartial may be displaced.&nbsp; The Crown would then have the opportunity to show, on balance, that the jury was impartial.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, the Crown should not have canvassed the three local police services for their opinion on the suitability of prospective jurors.&nbsp; These opinions clearly reflected information obtained as police officers and as residents in the community. &nbsp;In light of the broad nature of the inquiry conducted by the court officers, the numerous notations for which no basis was disclosed, and the fact that information obtained in the course of police activity may have played a role in the formation of the bald opinions provided, the Crown ought to have erred on the side of caution and disclosed the annotated jury panel lists to the defence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was nonetheless open to the Court of Appeal to find that there was no reasonable possibility that defence counsel would have exercised its peremptory challenges differently and that the jury would have been the same had the comments been disclosed.&nbsp; Absent any reasonable possibility that the defence was prejudiced or the trial was unfair, this finding is entitled to deference. Furthermore, the Crown’s request for the police opinions and the failure to disclose those opinions were not so offensive to the community’s sense of fair play and decency that the proceedings should be set aside as a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; There was no appearance of unfairness that would shake the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there should be no systematic distribution of jury panel lists to police services for comment regarding the suitability of jurors.&nbsp; In exercising its peremptory challenges, the Crown should not have the advantage of the use of state resources, which are not available to the defence, to choose a jury that may be perceived to be favourable to the Crown.&nbsp; Further, the privacy interests of prospective jurors should be protected, except as necessary for the administration of the criminal justice system.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree, however, that the Crown may engage in targeted consultation with a limited number of individuals working on the case with the prosecution, including police officers, to discuss concerns relating to the partiality, eligibility or suitability of a prospective juror.&nbsp; Any information relevant to the selection process must be disclosed, including any information acquired in the execution of police duties.&nbsp; If it is unclear whether a bald police opinion is based upon such information, the opinion should be disclosed.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our system of jury selection is sensitive to the privacy interests of prospective jurors (see <i>R. v. Williams</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128), and the proper functioning of the jury system, a constitutionally protected right in serious criminal charges, depends upon the willingness of jurors to discharge their functions honestly and honourably.&nbsp; This in turn is dependent, at the very minimum, on a system that ensures the safety of jurors, their sense of security, as well as their privacy.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jury is the ultimate decision maker.&nbsp; The fate of the accused is in its hands. The jury should not as a result of the manner of its selection appear to favour the Crown over the accused.&nbsp; Fairness should be the guiding principle of justice and the hallmark of criminal trials.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In principle, there is nothing wrong with the Crown’s using the collective experience and judgment of the prosecution team in exercising discretionary decisions.&nbsp; It is consistent with the duty to uphold an impartial and competent jury.&nbsp; It is consistent with the right to exercise discretionary challenges.&nbsp; It is consistent with the rules of professional conduct.&nbsp; And it is consistent with consultation conducted by the defence.</p>

McNeil</i>, 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at para. 17, that the duty to disclose extends to “any information in respect of which there is a reasonable possibility that it may assist the accused in the exercise of the right to make full answer and defence”, Rosenberg J.A. concluded:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police officers’ personal opinions about potential jurors are not relevant information relating to the investigation and are clearly not evidence to be adduced against the accused.&nbsp; Finally, such opinions are not “information” that will assist the accused in making full answer and defence.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent replies that disclosure has never extended to the opinions and general knowledge of prosecutors and police (except for those opinions capable of being evidence).&nbsp; The mere opinions of persons associated with the prosecution, with whom the Crown consults in preparation for trial, relating to tactical or discretionary decisions are not subject to the disclosure obligations.&nbsp; Just because those opinions may be useful to the defence does not give rise to disclosure obligations.&nbsp; The respondent equates the notations with the analysis, opinion and strategy protected by litigation or work product privilege.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court has recognized limits on disclosure obligations:&nbsp; the Crown must disclose all material unless it is (1) clearly irrelevant, such that it is not of any use to the defence; (2) protected by privilege; or (3) beyond the Crown’s control:&nbsp; <i>R.&nbsp;v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.&nbsp; However, in <i>R. v. Fagan</i> (1993), 18 C.R.R. (2d) 191 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), Humphrey J. concluded:&nbsp; “I think any information about a juror that would realistically affect a decision as to whether to accept or challenge that juror is information which should be shared by the Crown with the defence” (p. 191).&nbsp; Further, as Fish J. observed in <i>Blank v. Canada </i>(<i>Minister of Justice)</i>, 2006 SCC 39, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 319, at para. 55, the obligation to disclose is based on the Crown’s disproportionate access to vast resources.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not to say that the Crown is required to disclose the opinions of police along with the information on which those opinions are based.&nbsp; So long as the underlying information is disclosed, the defence will have access to the material on which the opinion is based, and can draw its own inferences for the purpose of exercising its peremptory challenges.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, where a police officer has knowledge, whether derived from her role as an officer or as a member of the community, that is relevant to the jury selection process, she must disclose it.&nbsp; Where police officers are individual participants in the prosecution team, they too have a duty to uphold the administration of justice by bringing such knowledge forward.</p>

The second is concerned with the integrity of the administration of justice. A miscarriage of justice may be found where anything happens in the course of a trial, including the appearance of unfairness, which is so serious that it shakes public confidence in the administration of justice . . . .&nbsp; [Citations omitted.]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[67]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the proposition that a positive notation tended to indicate a relationship with the police was true for only a small percentage of those who had a positive notation.&nbsp; Of the 51 positive opinions with no other information, the pre-screening process disclosed that only 11 were associated with a police/corrections relationship (most of those were of a general nature, including people who knew the deceased officer and/or his family).&nbsp; Of the 45 people who disclosed a police/corrections relationship in the pre-screening process, only 10 had positive notations (one was negative and two were queries).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, all prospective jurors were asked by the judge in the pre-screening process to disclose any general or specific relationship with the police or corrections.&nbsp; Juror 7 (“ok”) and juror 8 (“good”) did not disclose any such relationship.&nbsp; In many cases, specific information noted by police on the jury list was ultimately mentioned by the prospective jurors in court during the pre-screening process.&nbsp; The extensive pre-screening process and the challenge for cause eliminated any concern that “good” or “ok” meant a prospective juror had a relationship with police.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in consulting with the three local police services, the Crown asked for the court officers’ opinions about the “suitability” of prospective jurors, including partiality for or against the Crown. &nbsp;In that context, a positive indication of suitability implies no partiality for either party.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, I agree with the Court of Appeal that a positive notation did not mean that a juror was partial towards the Crown or had a close relationship with police; or that a negative notation meant partiality towards the accused.&nbsp; For all these reasons, it was open to the court to find that neither defence counsel nor an informed member of the public would be concerned that there was a reasonable possibility that jurors with positive notations who made it through the pre-screening and challenge for cause were partial towards the Crown.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:-58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Impact on the Defence’s Peremptory Challenges</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although two of the jurors were noted as “good” and “ok”, those notations obviously had little value, as the Crown placed little reliance on the notations in exercising its peremptory challenges.&nbsp; Even with access to the annotated list, defence counsel would have observed Crown counsel challenge a prospective juror with a “good” notation and allow a prospective juror with a “no” notation to become a juror, before the two jurors with “good” and “ok” went unchallenged.&nbsp; As noted in the evidence of Crown counsel, the pre-screening process allowed counsel to assess some prospective jurors based upon their responses in court.&nbsp; Thus, it was open to the Court of Appeal to find that defence counsel would have understood the notations to be of very little value.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the defence had five challenges left at the end of jury selection, which indicates that, in light of the extensive disclosure provided in pre-screening and during the challenge for cause, they were satisfied with the jury selected.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the bald opinions “good” and “ok” were superseded by the extensive pre-screening done with the trial judge, and the information it disclosed about the prospective jurors.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, it was open to the Court of Appeal to find on this record that there was no reasonable possibility that defence counsel would have exercised its peremptory challenges differently, and that the jury would have been the same had the comments been disclosed.&nbsp; This finding is entitled to deference.&nbsp; As a result, I am unable to find that there is a reasonable possibility that the defence was prejudiced or the trial was unfair.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Appearance of Unfairness</i></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[75]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that an appearance of unfairness sufficient to give rise to a miscarriage of justice arose in this case due to the informational imbalance in favour of the Crown, an appearance of bias on the part of the jury, and the Crown’s violation of provincial statutes.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:-58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Informational Imbalance in Favour of the Crown</u></p>

However, those notations obviously had little value, as the factual basis for the opinion was not provided.&nbsp; That the notations had little impact on the jury selection process is further evident in the fact that Crown counsel placed little reliance on the notations in exercising its peremptory challenges, challenging a juror with a positive notation and not challenging another with a negative notation.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:-58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Apprehension of Bias</u></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[78]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, an observer would also be aware that Crown counsel in this case demonstrated sensitivity to any hint of partiality against the accused.&nbsp; Crown counsel had a relative of the deceased removed from the jury list and disclosed the potential bias of one of the jurors, earning commendation for his professionalism from both the trial judge and experienced defence counsel.&nbsp; While the Crown’s failure to disclose the annotated jury lists was serious and must not be repeated, it was not motivated by improper purposes, such as an attempt to secure a jury favourable to the Crown.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 20 of the <i>Juries Act</i> provides that the sheriff must keep the jury roll “under lock and key . . . until ten days before the sittings of the court”.&nbsp; The Crown Attorney does not administer the Act.&nbsp; The Ministry staff manages jury administration on behalf of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial was scheduled to commence January 8, 2007.&nbsp; The Crown received the list early, on December 18, 2006.&nbsp; The parties have agreed that “[i]t was not policy for the Cobourg Crown’s office to obtain the list outside the 10-day period, nor did the Crown ask for the list outside the period in this case.&nbsp; The list was simply sent to their office early.&nbsp; It is reasonable to infer that the Christmas holidays may have impacted the timing of the release of the list in this case”: A.R., vol.

M.56.&nbsp; I agree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion: “. . . the appellant has not articulated how the alleged violation of this provincial legislation undermined the fairness of his trial and, in particular, how alleged violations of the privacy rights of others (the potential jurors) affected his right to a fair trial” (para. 29).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown had recourse to law enforcement resources that were not available and not disclosed to the defence.&nbsp; This created an imbalance, particularly in a case where the victim was a police officer.&nbsp; It was inappropriate for the Crown to broadly canvass police services for comment on prospective jurors.&nbsp; This conduct should not be repeated.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the police services clearly understood that state databases were not to be searched, and no investigation was conducted.&nbsp; The usefulness of the bald opinions was limited.&nbsp; Crown counsel was not motivated by improper purposes, and was diligent in twice disclosing information that might suggest partiality against the defence.&nbsp; The defence also conducted its own consultation with local residents.&nbsp; The pre-screening process, conducted by the trial judge in the presence of counsel, provided a much more detailed disclosure of useful information than that which was contained on the annotated jury list.</p>
