 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In the case at bar, the evidence established asphyxia as the cause of death.&nbsp; That result flowed entirely from the act of strangulation performed by Ross alone.&nbsp; There was no physical result flowing from Harbottle's actions which contributed to the asphyxiation of Ms. Bown.&nbsp; His acts adversely affected Ms. Bown's ability to resist Ross' attack but they did not contribute to her inability to breathe.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The majority agreed with the minority that liability under s.&nbsp;214(5) was limited to the person or persons who by their own act or acts <u>physically</u> caused the death of the victim.&nbsp; However, they concluded that the words "caused the death" should not have such a narrow an interpretation as to require that the accused must be the diagnostic or pathological cause of the death.&nbsp; In their view, Harbottle's holding of the victim's legs while Ross strangled her with the brassiere was a sufficient basis to conclude that he had caused her death pursuant to the provisions of s.&nbsp;214(5).&nbsp; They pointed out that if Harbottle had not done this, she might have resisted any attempts to strangle her just as she had successfully resisted the attempts to cut her wrists.&nbsp; They therefore dismissed the appeal.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">However, the trial judge told the jury she had difficulty pointing to evidence of planning and deliberation.&nbsp; Therefore the jury was charged as well on the basis that the murder could have occurred while the victim was being sexually assaulted or forcibly confined and might thereby be found to be first degree murder.&nbsp; It is impossible to know on which basis the jury reached its verdict.&nbsp; It follows that if the charge with regard to s.&nbsp;214(5) was not correct there must be a new trial.&nbsp; It is therefore essential that this issue be explored.&nbsp; </span></p>

Rodney, </i>[1990] 2 S.C.R. 687, and<i> R. v. Logan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731.&nbsp; The unlawful object and felony murder provisions, another source of concern, were struck down or rendered moribund in <i>R. v. Martineau</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633.&nbsp; Thus the danger of an accused's becoming subject to a first degree murder sentence in the absence of subjective blameworthiness has effectively disappeared.&nbsp; The earlier cases were primarily concerned with the harshness that would arise from applying a broad causation rule to parties to an offence.&nbsp; In my view, that cause for concern no longer exists.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The question which does arise is precisely what causal effect is required by the phrase "death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. caused by that person."&nbsp; I think with respect, that the physically caused test advocated by the majority of the Court of Appeal is too restrictive.&nbsp; It would tend to raise the same impractical distinctions that Wilson J. warned against in <i>R. v. Paré, supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;631, when she considered the phrase "while committing".&nbsp; She held that no sensible distinction existed between an accused who strangled his or her victim during the act of sexual assault and an accused who sexually assaulted and then shortly thereafter strangled the victim.&nbsp; In the case at bar, it would be unreasonable to suggest that, in order to be liable under s.&nbsp;214(5), Harbottle must have pathologically caused the death of the victim by pulling one end of the brassiere strap while his co-accused pulled the other.&nbsp; I find it impossible to distinguish between the blameworthiness of an accused who holds the victim's legs thus allowing his co-accused to strangle her and the accused who performs the act of strangulation.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">At the outset, it is important to remember that when s. 214(5) comes into play it is in essence a sentencing provision.&nbsp; First degree murder is an aggravated form of murder and not a distinct substantive offence.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Farrant</i>, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 124.&nbsp; It is only to be considered <u>after</u> the jury has concluded that the accused is guilty of murder by causing the death of the victim.&nbsp; An accused found guilty of second degree murder will receive a mandatory life sentence.&nbsp; What the jury must then determine is whether such aggravating circumstances exist that they justify&nbsp; ineligibility for parole for a quarter of a century.&nbsp; It is at this point that the requirement of causation set out in s.&nbsp;214(5) comes into play.&nbsp; The gravity of the crime and the severity of the sentence both indicate that a <u>substantial and high</u> degree of blameworthiness, above and beyond that of murder, must be established in order to convict an accused of first degree murder.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The consequences of a conviction for first degree murder and the wording of the section are such that the test of causation for s.&nbsp;214(5) must be a strict one.&nbsp; In my view, an accused may only be convicted under the subsection if the Crown establishes that the accused has committed an act or series of acts which are of such a<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup>*</sup></span></a> nature that they must be regarded as a substantial and integral cause of the death.&nbsp;&nbsp; A case which considered and applied a substantial cause test from Australia is <i>R. v. Hallett</i>, [1969] S.A.S.R. 141 (S.C. <i>in banco</i>).&nbsp; In that case, the victim was left beaten and unconscious by the sea and was drowned by the incoming tide.&nbsp; The court formulated the following test of causation, at p. 149, which I find apposite: </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The question to be asked is whether an act or series of acts (in exceptional cases an omission or series of omissions) consciously performed by the accused is or are so connected with the event that it or they must be regarded as having a sufficiently substantial causal effect which subsisted up to the happening of the event, without being spent or without being in the eyes of the law sufficiently interrupted by some other act or event.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The substantial causation test requires that the accused play a very active role -- usually a physical role -- in the killing.&nbsp; Under s. 214(5), the actions of the accused must form an essential, substantial and integral part of the killing of the victim. Obviously, this requirement is much higher than that described in <i>Smithers v. The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, which dealt with the offence of manslaughter.&nbsp; There it was held at p. 519 that sufficient causation existed where the actions of the accused were "a contributing cause of death, outside the <i>de minimis</i> range".&nbsp; That case demonstrates the distinctions in the degree of causation&nbsp; required for the different homicide offences.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The majority of the Court of Appeal below expressed the view that the acts of the accused must physically result in death.&nbsp; In most cases, to cause physically the death of the victim will undoubtedly be required to obtain a conviction under s.&nbsp;214(5).&nbsp; However, while the intervening act of another will often mean that the accused is no longer the substantial cause of the death under s. 214(5), there will be instances where an accused could well be the substantial cause of the death without physically causing it.&nbsp; For example, if one accused with intent to kill locked the victim in a cupboard while the other set fire to that cupboard, then the accused who confined the victim might be found to have caused the death of the victim pursuant to the provisions of s.&nbsp;214(5).&nbsp; Similarly an accused who fought off rescuers in order to allow his accomplice to complete the strangulation of the victim might also be found to have been a substantial cause of the death.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
