It does not authorize a sentence for crimes for which an accused is not being tried. The sentence of indeterminate detention that can be imposed under s. 688 is "<u>in lieu of</u> any other sentence that might be imposed <u>for the offence for which the offender has been convicted</u>". The individual, on a finding of guilty, is being sentenced for the "serious personal injury offence" for which he was convicted, albeit in a different way than would ordinarily be done. He is not being punished for what he might do. The punishment flows from the actual commission of a specific offence.</span></p>

Fundamental justice has not been infringed by Parliament's identifying those offenders who, in the interests of protecting the public, ought to be sentenced according to considerations not entirely based on a "just deserts" rationale. Such a sentence serves both a punitive and preventative role and its purpose, the protection of society, underlies the criminal law in general and sentencing in particular. The respective importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary in a rational system of sentencing according to the crime and the circumstances of the offender. Part XXI merely enables the court to accommodate its sentence to the common sense reality that the <u>present</u> condition of the offender is such that he or she is not inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint so that <u>future</u> violent acts can quite confidently be expected of that person.</span></p>

The legislative objectives of Part XXI are of sufficient importance to warrant limiting the rights and freedoms of dangerous offenders and the legislative classification of the target group of offenders meets the highest standard of rationality and proportionality that society can reasonably expect of Parliament. Preventive detention is not cruel and unusual treatment in the case of dangerous offenders, for the group to whom the legislation applies has been functionally defined so as to ensure that persons within the group evince the characteristics that render such detention necessary.</span></p>

If the sentence imposed under Part XXI were indeterminate, <i>simpliciter</i>, it would on occasion certainly result in sentences grossly disproportionate and hence violate s. 12. It is not necessary, however, for the parole process to be restricted to considering matters solely concerned with the prisoner's "dangerousness" for that would result in a lesser requirement for the dangerous offender than for other convicts.</span></p>

Section 7 guarantees an accused a fair hearing but not the most favourable procedures imaginable. The procedure at a Part XXI application is not unfair if it denies an offender the right to a jury's determination of his or her dangerousness. While the requirements of fundamental justice, at a minimum, embrace the requirements of procedural fairness, these vary according to the context in which they are invoked. Certain procedural protections, therefore, might be constitutionally mandated in one context but not in another.</span></p>

The offender has already been found guilty of an offence in a trial where he had the option of invoking his right to a jury. The subsequent procedure does not affect his liberty to the same extent as the initial determination of guilt or innocence. The legal classification of the proceeding as part of the sentencing process does not necessarily determine the scope of the procedural protection. It is not insignificant, however, that the judge at such a hearing retains a discretion to impose the designation or indeterminate sentence, or both. It is noteworthy, too, that Part XXI provides considerable procedural protection to the offender.</span></p>

An individual can be found to constitute a <u>threat</u> to society without requiring an ability to predict the future. It is not illogical for a court to assert that it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the test of dangerousness has been met, that there exists a <u>certain</u> potential for harm. Appellant, in asserting that proof of a likelihood beyond a reasonable doubt still amounts merely to proof of a likelihood, is challenging not the standard of proof but the fact that certain persons found to be "dangerous" will, in fact, act dangerously.</span></p>

(dissenting in part): A person against whom a Part XXI application is brought is one "charged with an offence" under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s. 11<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and entitled to that section's particular guarantees. A person is "charged with an offence" under s. 11 when a formal allegation is made against him which, if true, would give a judge jurisdiction to impose a criminal or penal sanction. Section 11(<i>f</i>) guarantees anyone in jeopardy of being sentenced to imprisonment for five years or more as a result of a determination of guilt the right to have that determination made by a jury. To say that an application under Part XXI is not a charge of an offence violates the spirit of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and leaves without that protection those put in one of the most serious jeopardies the law has created.</span></p>

A conviction gives the judge jurisdiction to impose a determinate sentence as set out in the provision creating the offence. It is the finding of dangerousness, however, and not the conviction for the personal injury offence, that gives the judge jurisdiction to impose an indeterminate sentence. It is thus a separate offence.</span></p>

Section 689(2) of the <i>Code</i>, in that it provides that a Part XXI application shall be heard and determined by the court without a jury, clearly restricts this right and must be declared inoperative.</span></p>

An accused, in deciding whether to plead guilty or not guilty, is foremost concerned with the worst that can happen if convicted. The accused is entitled to the protection of s. 7 if he probably would not have pleaded guilty, had he known at the time of his plea that the Crown would be seeking an order of preventive indeterminate detention. Knowledge of such an order cannot be attributed by virtue of the presence of Part XXI in the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>

In his view, it had been shown that the appellant had a "sociopathic personality" and had so little conscience that it did not govern his actions. He concluded that it could be said with "a high degree of confidence" that it was "very likely" that the appellant would constitute a danger to the psychological or physical health and lives of others owing to "his inâbuilt, perhaps congenital indifference to the consequences to others, his lack of affect, his lack of feeling for others". He belonged, the judge stated, to a class of people who, though mentally able to understand the law and to conform their conduct to its dictates, are so irresponsive to the law that they must be dealt with by extraordinary measures.</span></p>

It is the product of frequently amended legislation that has existed in Canada, in one form or another, since 1947. It has its genesis in the <i>Prevention of Crime Act, 1908</i>, 8 Edw. 7, c. 59, ss. 10â16 (U.K.), under which a person convicted of a crime was subject to a "further sentence" of not less than five or more than ten years as preventive detention if he or she was found to be an habitual criminal. During the debates in Parliament on that Act, its author, Lord Gladstone, "made it clear that it was intended to deal not with the generality of `habituals' but only with that more limited body of `professional criminals' or `persistent dangerous criminals' engaged in the more serious forms of crime" (Fox, <i>The Modern English Prison</i> (London 1934), at p. 168).</span></p>

It observed, at p. 218, that:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">Notwithstanding the best methods of punishment and reformation that may be adopted, there will always remain a residue of the criminal class which is of incurable criminal tendencies and which will be unaffected by reformative efforts. These become hardened criminals for whom "iron bars" and "prison walls" have no terrors, and in whom no hope or desire for reformation, if it ever existed, remains.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">It thus recommended that legislation be enacted to identify this residual class of criminals and to provide for their indeterminate detention in a special prison. The purpose of such detention was conceived of as "neither punitive nor reformative but primarily segregation from society" (at p.&nbsp;223).</span></p>

Section 18 of the <i>Criminal Code Amendment Act</i>, S.C. 1947, c. 55, permitted the preventive detention "for the protection of the public" of "habitual criminals", defined essentially as persons having a record of three previous indictable offences and who are persistently leading a criminal life (s. 575<span style="text-transform:uppercase">c</span>). Additional amendments (S.C. 1948, c. 39, s. 43) provided for the sentencing in the same manner of "criminal sexual psychopaths", defined as persons "who by a course of misconduct in sexual matters [have] evidenced a lack of power to control [their] sexual impulses and who as a result [are] likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, loss, pain or other evil on any person" (s. 1054<span style="text-transform:uppercase">a</span>(8)).</span></p>

However, the Commission also recognized the desirability, in policy terms, of such legislation. In the opening words of the Report's discussion of the subject, it stated at p. 241:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">It appears to the Committee that the protection of the public from unlawful violence, or from unlawful conduct which represents a serious threat to the physical safety of citizens, is one of the most urgent problems of the criminal law.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">The Commission thus recommended that the extant legislation be replaced by better tailored "dangerous offender" legislation. Its concerns were reflected in the decision of this Court in <i>Hatchwell v. The Queen</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 39, where the present Chief Justice stated, at p. 43:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitual criminal legislation and preventive detention are primarily designed for the persistent dangerous criminal and not for those with a prolonged record of minor offences against property. The dominant purpose is to protect the public when the past conduct of the criminal demonstrates a propensity for crimes of violence against the person, and there is a real and present danger to life or limb.</span></p>

In brief, Part XXI provides that where a person has been found guilty of a "serious personal injury offence", the court may, upon application, find the offender to be a dangerous offender and may thereupon impose a sentence of indeterminate detention in lieu of any other sentence that the offender might have received for the offence. The key provision is s. 688 which reads as follows:</span></p>

Motor Vehicle Act</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, this Court held that the phrase "principles of fundamental justice" sets out the parameters of the right not to be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person. These principles were stated to inhere in the basic tenets and principles not only of the judicial system but also of the other components of our legal system (at p. 512, <i>per</i> Lamer J.) Hence, to determine whether Part XXI violates the principles of fundamental justice by the deprivation of liberty suffered by the offender, it is necessary to examine Part XXI in light of the basic principles of penal policy that have animated legislative and judicial practice in Canada and other common law jurisdictions.</span></p>

If this statement correctly described what in fact occurs under Part XXI it would, indeed, constitute a violation of s. 7. The reality, however, is quite different. What section 688 does is to permit a judge to impose a sentence of indeterminate detention on an individual for having committed an offence, which sentence is "<u>in lieu of</u> any other sentence that might be imposed <u>for the offence for which the offender has been convicted</u>". (Emphasis added.) The individual is clearly being sentenced for the "serious personal injury offence" he or she has been found guilty of committing, albeit in a different way than would ordinarily be done. It must be remembered that the appellant was not picked up off the street because of his past criminality (for which he has already been punished), or because of fears or suspicions about his criminal proclivities, and then subjected to a procedure in order to determine whether society would be better off if he were incarcerated indefinitely. Rather he was arrested and prosecuted for a very serious violent crime and subjected to a procedure aimed at determining the appropriate penalty that should be inflicted upon him in the circumstances.</span></p>

The punishment, as I noted, flows from the actual commission of a specific crime, the requisite elements of which have been proved to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

Such considerations play a role in a very significant number of sentences. I accordingly agree with the respondent's submission that it cannot be considered a violation of fundamental justice for Parliament to identify those offenders who, in the interests of protecting the public, ought to be sentenced according to considerations which are not entirely reactive or based on a "just deâ serts" rationale. The imposition of a sentence which "is partly punitive but is mainly imposed for the protection of the public" (<i>Re Moore and the Queen</i> (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 306 (Ont. H.C.)) seems to me to accord with the fundamental purpose of the criminal law generally, and of sentencing in particular, namely, the protection of society. In a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender. No one would suggest that any of these functional considerations should be excluded from the legitimate purview of legislative or judicial decisions regarding sentencing.</span></p>

It is clear that the indeterminate detention is intended to serve both punitive and preventive purposes. Both are legitimate aims of the criminal sanction. Indeed, when society incarcerates a robber for, say, ten years, it is clear that its goal is both to punish the person and prevent the recurrence of such conduct during that period. Preventive detention in the context of Part XXI, however, simply represents a judgment that the relative importance of the objectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and retribution are greatly attenuated in the circumstances of the individual case, and that of prevention, correspondingly increased. Part XXI merely enables the court to accommodate its sentence to the common sense reality that the <u>present</u> condition of the offender is such that he or she is not inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint so that <u>future</u> violent acts can quite confidently be expected of that person. In such circumstances it would be folly not to tailor the sentence accordingly.</span></p>

C.A.), Jessup J.A. stated, at pp. 147â48:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an accused has been convicted of a serious crime in itself calling for a substantial sentence and when he suffers from some mental or personality disorder rendering him a danger to the community but not subjecting him to confinement in a mental institution and when it is uncertain when, if ever, the accused will be cured of his affliction, in my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of life. Such a sentence in such circumstances, amounts to an indefinite sentence under which the Parole Board can release him to the community when it is satisfied, upon adequate psychiatric examination, it is in the interests of the accused and of the community for him to return to society. The policy expressed in my opinion is that of the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal: cf. Thomas, <i>Principles of Sentencing</i>, at pp. 272â9.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">A similar view was taken by Lieberman J.A. for the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Kempton</i> (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 176, at pp. 191â92. Indeed, it is not without profound significance that the appellant could, theoretically, have received a life sentence for one of the crimes for which he was convicted, namely, breaking and entering a dwelling house contrary to s. 306(1)(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Code</i>. This starkly emphasizes that the sentence actually imposed differs in emphasis and degree, but not in kind, from that which he might otherwise have received.</span></p>

However, the basis of the retrenchment has not been a rejection of the principle of indeterminate detention for dangerous offenders. Rather, it has been the concern that the <i>Hill</i> principle not be used to circumvent the provisions of Part XXI with its attendant safeguards for the offender. As Martin J.A., for the Ontario Court of Appeal, observed in <i>R. v. Crosby</i> (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 233, at p. 240:</span></p>

This court has said on more than one occasion that rather than sentence a person who has been convicted of a serious offence and who is a continuing danger to life imprisonment, the prosecution should proceed under the dangerous offender provisions, where the offender has greater protection.</span></p>

Section 37 of the <i>Criminal Justice Act 1967</i>, 1967, c. 80 (U.K.), abolished such detention but the principle that a persistent recidivist should be detained for a longer period than the ordinary criminal has been retained in the form of the "extended" sentence. Under the relevant provisions, where the prosecution establishes certain conditions demonstrating persistence and the like, the court may impose a sentence <u>in excess</u> of the statutory maximum for the offence.</span></p>

A. Thomas, <i>Principles of Sentencing </i>(2nd ed. 1979), at p. 37). The circumstances in which the indeterminate term is considered appropriate were set out by the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Hodgson</i> (1967), 52 Cr. App. R. 113, at p. 114:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the following conditions are satisfied, a sentence of life imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant's history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence. We think that these conditions are satisfied in the present case and that they justify an indeterminate life sentence. The Home Secretary has of course the power to release the appellant on licence when it is thought safe to release him, if that time comes.</span></p>

In their comprehensive review of protective sentencing of dangerous offenders in the United Kingdom, Floud and Young, <i>Dangerousness and Criminal Justice</i> (London 1981), note that "the laws of most, if not all, western countries make provision for the sentencing of offenders against whom the public requires special protection". For example, they observe, Denmark provides for protective custody of dangerous offenders who commit or attempt to commit homicide, robbery, rape and other serious offences. Similarly, the Swedish Penal Code of 1965 provides that "internment may be imposed if the crime ... is punishable by imprisonment for two years or longer and in view of the defendant's criminality, mental condition, conduct and other circumstances, a longâlasting deprivation of liberty, without duration fixed in advance, is deemed necessary to prevent further serious criminality on his part" (at p. 103). Norval Morris, in "The Habitual Criminal" (1967), 13 <i>McGill L.J.</i> 534, also observes that a number of countries have enacted legislation to deal with incorrigible or habitual offenders, and notes, at p. 536, that generally three elements are included in the definition of the group targeted for such punishmentââcriminal qualities inherent or latent in the mental constitution, a settled practice in crime, and a public danger.</span></p>

For example, Title 18 of the <i>United States Code</i>, Â§ 3575 (repealed, effective November 1, 1986, s. 235 Pub.L. 98â473), provided for a greatly increased range of penalties if the defendant was shown to be a "dangerous special offender". Section 3575(f) provided that "A defendant is dangerous . . . if a period of confinement longer than that provided for such felony is required for the protection of the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant". This statute has withstood constitutional attack in several federal Court of Appeal decisions (see <i>U.S. v. Davis</i>, 710 F.2d 104 (3rd Cir. 1983); <i>U.S. v. Stewart</i>, 531 F.2d 326 (6th Cir. 1975),<i> certiorari</i> denied 426 U.S. 922; <i>U.S. v. Neary</i>, 552 F.2d 1184 (7th Cir. 1977),<i> certiorari</i> denied 434 U.S. 864; and <i>U.S. v.

Langevin</i> (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336 (Ont. C.A.) In <i>Re Moore</i>, Ewaschuk J. appears to have been influenced by the fact that this Court had, in <i>Ex Parte Matticks</i> (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 213 n,<i> sub nom. Pearson v. Lecorre</i> [1973] S.C.R. vi, upheld the previous habitual offender legislation under s. 2(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, R.S.C. 1970, App. III, which provides that no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to "impose or authorize the imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment". If that more Draconian legislation was valid, he reasoned, so must the present legislation be valid. The reasons given by Ewaschuk J. for sustaining the legislation may be summarized as follows: the legislation would be acceptable to a large segment of the population; the specificity of the statutory requirements ensured their application on a rational basis; the protection of society is an important social purpose; the legislation is not an affront to public standards of decency given the procedural safeguards built into the process; and, finally, the legislation is tailored so as not to be disproportionate to the crime and the offender's potential to harm others. Although all punishment is in some degree degrading to human dignity, he concluded, Part XXI is not impermissibly, or cruelly and unusually, degrading to human dignity.</span></p>

I would agree with Laskin C.J. in <i>Miller and Cockriell, supra, </i>where he defined the phrase "cruel and unusual" as a "compendious expression of a norm". The criterion which must be applied in order to determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec12" target="_blank">s. 12<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is, to use the words of Laskin C.J. in <i>Miller and Cockriell, supra</i>, at p. 688, "whether the punishment prescribed is so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency". In other words, though the state may impose punishment, the effect of that punishment must not be grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate.</span></p>

The other purposes which may be pursued by the imposition of punishment, in particular the deterrence of other potential offenders, are thus not relevant at this stage of the inquiry. This does not mean that the judge or the legislator can no longer consider general deterrence or other penological purposes that go beyond the particular offender in determining a sentence, but only that the resulting sentence must not be grossly disproportionate to what the offender deserves. If a grossly disproportionate sentence is "prescribed by law", then the purpose which it seeks to attain will fall to be assessed under s. 1. Section 12 ensures that individual offenders receive punishments that are appropriate, or at least not grossly disproportionate, to their particular circumstances, while s. 1 permits this right to be overridden to achieve some important societal objective.</span></p>

If it is grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate, then it infringes s. 12. The effect of the sentence is often a composite of many factors and is not limited to the quantum or duration of the sentence but includes its nature and the conditions under which it is applied. Sometimes by its length alone or by its very nature will the sentence be grossly disproportionate to the purpose sought. Sometimes it will be the result of the combination of factors which, when considered in isolation, would not in and of themselves amount to gross disproportionality. For example, twenty years for a first offence against property would be grossly disproportionate, but so would three months of imprisonment if the prison authorities decide it should be served in solitary confinement&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>

Thus, to refer to tests listed by Professor Tarnopolsky, the determination of whether the punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose, whether it is founded on recognized sentencing principles, and whether there exist valid alternatives to the punishment imposed, are all guidelines which, without being determinative in themselves, help to assess whether the punishment is grossly disproportionate.</span></p>

If, in light of these considerations, the punishment is found to be grossly disproportionate, a remedy must be afforded the offender in the absence of social objectives that transcend the circumstances of the particular case and are capable of justifying the punishment under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec1" target="_blank">s. 1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

It seems to me that the legislative criteria embodied in s. 688 for designating offenders as dangerous and for sentencing such persons tend, although not conclusively, to sustain the legislation as not constituting a violation of s. 12. I say "not conclusively" for, as will be seen, it is only when s. 688 is read in the context of the scheme as a whole that the legislation can be upheld.</span></p>

These offences all relate to conduct tending to cause severe physical danger or severe psychological injury to other persons. Significantly, the maximum penalty for all these offences must be at least ten years' imprisonment. Secondly, it must be established to the satisfaction of the court that the offence for which the person has been convicted is not an isolated occurrence, but part of a pattern of behaviour which has involved violence, aggressive or brutal conduct, or a failure to control sexual impulses. Thirdly, it must be established that the pattern of conduct is very likely to continue and to result in the kind of suffering against which the section seeks to protect, namely, conduct endangering the life, safety or physical wellâbeing of others or, in the case of sexual offences, conduct causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons. Also explicit in one form or another in each subparagraph of s. 687 is the requirement that the court must be satisfied that the pattern of conduct is substantially or pathologically intractable. Finally, the court has the discretion not to designate the offender as dangerous or to impose an indeterminate sentence, even in circumstances where all of these criteria are met.</span></p>

Not only has a diligent attempt been made to carefully define a very small group of offenders whose personal characteristics and particular circumstances militate strenuously in favour of preventive incarceration, but it would be difficult to imagine a better tailored set of criteria that could effectively accomplish the purposes sought to be attained.</span></p>

It is equally important to consider the constitutional validity, under s. 12, of the actual "treatment meted out". There can be no doubt that detention <i>per se</i>, and preventive detention in particular, is not cruel and unusual in the case of dangerous offenders, for the group to whom the legislation applies has been functionally defined so as to ensure that persons within the group evince the very characteristics that render such detention necessary.</span></p>

And it is difficult to deny that the effects of an indeterminate sentence on a dangerous offender must be profoundly devastating. It has, for instance, been argued before the Court that the imposition of an indeterminate sentence, because of its uncertainty, saps the will of an offender, removing any incentive to rehabilitate himself or herself. However, this is equally true of a "determinate" life sentence such as is provided for by s. 306(1)(<i>b</i>). Indeed, in view of the provisions regarding parole it is possible, at least theoretically, that a dangerous offender could be released consequent on his first review, three years after the detention was imposed and well in advance of the seven or so years an offender serving a life sentence must serve before his or her first such review. This is, however, rather unrealistic. Evidence before the Court indicated that between 1980â86, only six dangerous offenders were granted day parole, two of whom had served 10â15 years, three, 15â20 years, and one, more than 20 years.</span></p>

When a person is imprisoned for an absolute and determinate period, there is at least the certainty that the incarceration will end at the termination of that period. The convicted person, during the term of sentence, can remain in a passive state, secure in the knowledge that he or she will be released thereafter. For the offender undergoing an indeterminate sentence, however, the sole hope of release is parole. The ordinary convict, it is true, can also choose to actively affect the length of his or her sentence by attempting to conform his or her behaviour to meet the expectations of the Parole Board. But whatever the legal nature of the interest in the availability of parole may be in general, it seems to me that, as a <u>factual</u> matter, the availability of parole is not as important a factor in deciding whether a determinate sentence is cruel and unusual as it is in assessing the constitutionality of a Part XXI sentence.</span></p>

In the present context, however, it is, subsequent to the actual imposition of the sentence itself, the sole protection of the dangerous offender's liberty interests. Indeed, from the point of view of the dangerous offender his or her detention is never complete until it is factually complete. In this sense, each opportunity for parole will appear to the dangerous offender as the sole mechanism for terminating his or her detention, for rendering it certain. Moreover, it is clear that an enlightened inquiry under s. 12 must concern itself, first and foremost, with the way in which the effects of punishment are likely to be experienced. Seen in this light, therefore, the parole process assumes the utmost significance for it is that process alone that is capable of truly accommodating and tailoring the sentence to fit the circumstances of the individual offender.</span></p>

The sentence is imposed "in lieu of any other sentence" that might have been imposed and, like any other such sentence, must be served according to its tenor. <u>The offender is not being sentenced to a term of imprisonment until he is no longer a dangerous offender</u>. Indeed, s. 695.1 provides that the circumstances of the offender be reviewed for the purpose of determining whether <u>parole</u> should be granted and, if so, on what conditions; it does not provide that the label of dangerous offender be removed or altered. Finally, the very words of s. 695.1 of the <i>Code</i> and s. 10(1)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Parole Act</i> establish an ongoing process for rendering the sentence meted out to a dangerous offender one that accords with his or her specific circumstances.</span></p>

I do not think it can be argued, either as a matter of logic or of common sense, that by virtue of a decision to sentence an offender according to considerations based <u>primarily</u> on prevention, other equally valid, subsisting penal goals cease to be relevant. To reiterate, protecting society from the dangerous offender never wholly supplants the other legitimate objectives embodied in a Part XXI sentence.</span></p>

It seems to me that had s. 695.1 provided for a "dangerous offender review", rather than a parole review, but borrowed the identical criteria employed in the <i>Parole Act</i>, it would perhaps be more readily apparent that the review provided for does, indeed, accomplish the requisite tailoring sufficient to sustain the legislative scheme as a whole. Section 10(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) requires the Board to consider whether the release of the inmate would constitute an "undue risk" to society; if the accused continues to be dangerous then, by definition, this criterion remains unsatisfied. Section 10(1)(<i>a</i>) also requires that the Board be satisfied that the inmate has derived the maximum benefit from incarceration and that the inmate's reform and rehabilitation would be aided by release.</span></p>

The fact that dangerous offenders may be less likely to satisfy these requirements is primarily a function of their dangerousness, not of the punishment imposed. Of course, the imposition of an indeterminate sentence may, like all sentences, sap the will of the offender to rehabilitate himself or herself. However, I would have thought the incentive to reform is far greater, at least theoretically, in the case of a dangerous offender. In this regard, I note that the availability of parole has been seen to validate mandatory life sentences in the context of similarly motivated legislation in the United States (see <i>Solem v. Helm</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> per</i> Powell J., for the majority).</span></p>

The word "grossly", it seems to me, reflects this Court's concern not to hold Parliament to a standard so exacting, at least in the context of s. 12, as to require punishments to be perfectly suited to accommodate the moral nuances of every crime and every offender.</span></p>

The conclusion that the liberty interest of a dangerous offender that is at stake in any parole hearing is, as a practical matter, different from that of "ordinary" offenders serving determinate sentences might affect the way in which the procedural adequacy of the review procedure might be viewed. However, in view of my conclusion that the dangerous offender is not being treated in a substantively unfair manner, and in view of the statement by Lamer J. in <i>Smith, supra</i>, at p. 1075 that "s. 12 is concerned with the <u>effect</u> of a punishment and, as such, the process by which the punishment is imposed is not ... of any great relevance to a determination under s. 12", I will postpone consideration of this matter for scrutiny under s. 7 when I turn to a discussion of some of the more specifically procedural issues.</span></p>

He suggested that Part XXI results in arbitrary detention in the following respects: the test of "likelihood" under Part XXI is unconstitutionally vague; the labelling of persons as dangerous offenders is arbitrary since it is based on inherently unreliable psychiatric evidence; and there are no guidelines with respect to the invocation of Part XXI such that the prosecutor has unfettered discretion as to when to make a dangerous offender application.</span></p>

The issue was not strenuously argued by the parties or examined in depth in the courts below. More to the point, however, is that, in my view, even assuming s. 9 were given the broadest possible interpretation, the appellant's submissions in this regard must fail.</span></p>

Konechny</i> (1983), 38 C.R. (3d) 69, per Lambert J.A., dissenting, at pp. 70â71). However, assuming that the right to attack a sentence under s. 9 is not foreclosed by the fact that it is legislatively prescribed, and that the statutory procedures have been judicially complied with (see <i>Mitchell v. Attorney General of Ontario</i> (1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 225 (Ont. H.C.), <i>per</i> Linden J., at p. 239), it seems to me that in no sense of the word can the imprisonment resulting from the successful invocation of Part XXI be considered "arbitrary". Indeed, when one fleshes out the specific submissions of the appellant in this regard they appear to be merely attempts to recast issues considered elsewhere in this judgment. For example, although the first two submissions made under this heading are directed to the alleged lack of proportionality or adequacy, in constitutional terms, of the legislative means to the objectives sought to be attained, they are not independently addressed to the arbitrary nature of the imprisonment. To the extent that these arguments reflect the appellant's concern that the procedure for the designation of offenders as dangerous is, in general terms, impermissibly unfair, I will address these arguments later under s. 7, where they properly belong. Similarly, to the extent that they belie a fear that punishment is being imposed without due concern for the circumstances of the particular offender, I have already addressed these arguments under s.&nbsp;12.</span></p>

If these criteria are themselves unconstitutional, it is because they otherwise fail adequately to safeguard the liberty of the individual, not because they are arbitrary. Indeed, as Ewaschuk J. observed in <i>Re Moore, supra</i>, at p. 314, ". . . the legislative criteria for finding a person a dangerous offender [are] perhaps the most detailed and demanding in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>". Moreover, implicit in my discussion of the s. 12 issue is the common sense conclusion that the criteria in Part XXI are anything but arbitrary in relation to the objectives sought to be attained; they are clearly designed to segregate a small group of highly dangerous criminals posing threats to the physical or mental wellâbeing of their victims.</span></p>

The appellant is not suggesting that prosecutors, in his case or generally, have exercised their discretion arbitrarily in this regard. Indeed, the affidavit evidence filed by the Crown in the companion case of<i> R. v. Milne</i> indicates that from 1978â86, an average of only seven persons per year were sentenced under Part XXI. On average, each offender committed 12.12 offences, 2.2 of which were violent and 3.53 of which were sexual in nature. This suggests that the legislation has, in general, not been abused. I have no doubt that if and when it is alleged that a prosecutor in a particular case was motivated by improper or arbitrary reasons in making a Part XXI application, a s. 24 remedy would lie. However, I do not think there is any warrant for presuming the executive will act unconstitutionally or for improper purposes.</span></p>

In this respect, I am in complete agreement with Crown counsel's submission that ". . . it is the absence of discretion which would, in many cases, render arbitrary the law's application". As he notes, "the absence of any discretion with respect to Part XXI would necessarily require the Crown to always proceed under Part XXI if there was the barest <i>prima facie</i> case and the Court, upon making a finding that the offender is a dangerous offender, would always be required to impose an indeterminate sentence".</span></p>

As Ewaschuk J. stated in <i>Re Moore</i>,<i> supra</i>, at p. 310, the offender cannot be heard to complain of a discretion that can only operate to the offender's benefit. Indeed, it is apparent that one feature of s. 5(2) of the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i> that disturbed this Court in <i>Smith</i>,<i> supra</i>, was the very fact that the imposition of sentence followed automatically upon conviction.</span></p>

However, the appellant is not arguing, as the accused did in <i>Morgentaler v. The Queen</i> that this lack of uniformity is mandated <u>by the terms of the legislation</u> (which may or may not be a meritorious argument). Rather, this argument appears to recast the prosecutorial discretion argument. Moreover, variation among provinces in this regard may be inevitable and, indeed, desirable, in a country where a federal statute is administered by local authorities. In any event, it may be observed parenthetically that while the affidavit evidence suggests that dangerous offender applications are made more frequently in British Columbia (25% of all such applications) and, perhaps surprisingly, never in Quebec, Newfoundland, Manitoba or Prince Edward Island, no attempt has been made to explain the significance of this data, for example, by relating it to the relevant population of offenders potentially coming within the provisions of Part XXI.</span></p>

In the leading case of <i>Brusch v. The Queen</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373, this Court considered whether an individual had a right under the former habitual offender legislation to elect that the question whether he was an habitual offender be determined by a jury. In that case, the relevant <i>Code</i> provision, in contrast to the present legislation, provided for the imposition of a "further sentence" if it was "found by a jury or a judge" that the offender was an habitual criminal. Estey J., for the majority, held that an offender did not have a right to an election even though the allegation stating that the accused was an habitual criminal was contained in the indictment. In his opinion, that allegation did not charge the accused with an offence within the meaning of the relevant <i>Code</i> provisions. He stated, at pp. 381â82:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, ss. 825, 826 and 834 make it clear that Parliament intended the provisions for an election should only apply in certain indictable offences. Being a habitual criminal is not an offence. A charge that an accused is a habitual criminal is added to an indictment for an offence. Though Parliament in this sense contemplated that it should be a part of the indictment, it does not thereby become a part of the offence charged in the indictment. This is made clear by the provisions which require that the accused shall first be arraigned and tried for the offence. Then only if he be guilty of that offence will the court direct its attention to the issue as to his being a habitual criminal and, if so, should there be directed an indeterminate period of preventive detention. Throughout the proceeding the offence or crime charged is treated in every respect, even as to punishment, as separate and distinct from being a habitual criminal. With great respect to those who entertain a contrary opinion, Part XVIII restricts the right to an election to certain indictable offences. The addition of a charge of being a habitual criminal, after the required notice, does not become a part of the offence or crime charged in the indictment. There is, therefore, no right, within the meaning of the provisions of Part XVIII, to a further election upon the crime as charged, when a charge of being a habitual criminal is added to the indictment.</span></p>

Hunter</i>, [1921] 1 K.B. 555, where it was said by the Earl of Reading C.J. that the process merely involved the assertion of a status or condition in the accused which would enable the court, if it were established, to deal with him in a certain manner (at pp. 375â76).</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the hypothesis that the statement added to the charge sheet stating the appellant to be a habitual criminal was not the charge of an offence, in my opinion that addition had the effect of changing the charge upon which the appellant had made his election to one different in substance, with the result that the appellant never elected to be tried by the learned judge on the charge on which he was tried. In <i>Rex v. Armitage</i> [[1939] O.R. 417], the circumstances dealt with were different from those in the case at bar but I think that case rightly decides that a change in an indictment which makes it possible to impose a longer term of imprisonment in the event of conviction cannot be regarded as an amendment in matter of form only. When, pursuant to s. 827 of the <i>Code</i>, the judge stated to the appellant that he was charged with an offence, he described only the offence of breaking and entering and no notice of any sort was conveyed to the appellant that if he elected trial by a judge on that charge he would at the same time be giving up his right to have a jury determine the question whether or not he was a habitual criminal.</span></p>

Johnston</i> and <i>Regina v. McKenzie</i>, that the rule of evidence governing the admissibility of statements made by a person charged with an offence has no application in the case of statements made by a sexual offender to psychiatrists conducting examinations in accordance with recognized normal psychiatric procedures, in order to assist the Court in proceedings under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec661" target="_blank">s. 661<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the reasons flows from the very nature of the issue involved in these proceedings. The issue, in these proceedings which can only be resorted to if the accused has been convicted of a sexual offence, is not whether he should be convicted of another offence, but solely whether he is afflicted by a state or condition that makes him a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec659" target="_blank">s. 659<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>b</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. To be so afflicted is not an offence. As to this aspect of the matter, the line of reasoning adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the <i>King v. Hunter</i> and this Court in <i>Brusch v. The Queen</i>, holding that a charge of being a habitual criminal is not a charge of an offence but merely the assertion of a status or condition, applies here on a charge of being a dangerous sexual offender. Indeed, a reference to subs. 3 of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec661" target="_blank">s. 661<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> makes it clear that the object sought by Parliament, in enacting these special provisions, is not to create an offence but to enable the Court, in cases where a sexual offender is found to be a dangerous sexual offender, to pass upon him a further sentence in lieu of or in addition to the sentence passed or which could have been passed for the sexual offence of which he was convicted. <u>These proceedings do not involve the conviction of an offence, but the determination of the sentence which may be pronounced after conviction</u>. The confession rule, which excludes incriminatory statements not affirmatively proved to have been made voluntarily, is a rule which has been designed for proceedings where, broadly speaking, the guilt or innocence of a person charged with an offence is the matter in issue. The rule has not been established for proceedings related to the determination of a sentence. I know of no binding authority holding that its application extends, and can think of no valid reason why it should be held to extend to examinations conducted by psychiatrists, in compliance with subs. 2 of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec661" target="_blank">s. 661<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, in order that they could form and subsequently convey to the Court an opinion as to the mental state or condition of a sexual offender.

As I observed in <i>Canada v.

It seems clear to me that for the purposes of s. 11 it would be quite inappropriate to conclude that a convicted person is charged with an offence when confronted with a Part XXI application. How can it be said that the right to the presumption of innocence until proven <u>guilty</u> (s. 11(<i>d</i>)) and the right to bail (s. 11(<i>e</i>)), for example, could have any application in the context of the unique postâconviction proceeding mandated by Part XXI?</span></p>

For they, in effect, illustrate some of the parameters of the "right" to life, liberty and security of the person; they are examples of instances in which the "right" to life, liberty and security of the person would be violated in a manner which is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. To put matters in a different way, ss. 7 to 14 could have been fused into one section, with inserted between the words of s. 7 and the rest of those sections the oft utilised provision in our statutes, "and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing (s. 7) the following shall be deemed to be in violation of a person's rights under this section".</span></p>

Under Colorado's criminal procedure, here challenged, the invocation of the Sex Offenders Act means the making of a new charge leading to criminal punishment. The case is not unlike those under recidivist statutes where an habitual criminal issue is "a distinct issue" (<i>Graham</i> v. <i>West Virginia</i>, 224 U.S. 616, 625) on which a defendant "must receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard." <i>Oyler</i> v. <i>Boles</i>, 368 U.S. 448, 452; <i>Chandler</i> v. <i>Fretag</i>, 348 U.S. 3, 8. Due process, in other words, requires that he be present with counsel, have an opportunity to be heard, be confronted with witnesses against him, have the right to crossâexamine, and to offer evidence of his own. And there must be findings adequate to make meaningful any appeal that is allowed. The case is therefore quite unlike the Minnesota statute we considered in <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Probate Court</i>, 309 U.S. 270, where in a proceeding to have a person adjudged a "psychopathic personality" there was a hearing where he was represented by counsel and could compel the production of witnesses on his behalf. <i>Id</i>., at 275. None of these procedural safeguards we have mentioned is present under Colorado's Sex Offenders Act. We therefore hold that it is deficient in due process as measured by the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Pointer</i> v. <i>Texas</i>, 380 U.S. 400.</span></p>

Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 75, S.Ct. 1, 99 L. Ed. 4 (1954) and Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), that the habitual offenders acts there involved, which provided for increased criminal punishment because of prior convictions, created essentially independent criminal offenses. This required that the determination of the issues of fact involved in the statutory proceedings must conform to the constitutionally guaranteed safeguards of due process in substantive criminal trials. In Oyler, the Court said: "Even though an habitual criminal charge does not state a separate offense, the determination of whether one is an habitual criminal is `essentially independent' of the determination of guilt on the underlying substantive offense. Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 8 (75 S.Ct. 1, 99 L.Ed. 4) (1954).&nbsp;* * *(A) defendant must receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to the recidivist charge even if due process does not require that notice be given prior to the trial on the substantive offense." (368 U.S., at 452, 82 S.Ct. at 503). If the determination of the independent issue in Oyler, limited as it was to judicial records and identity, made the new charge separate from the subordinate offense and thus required full due process, it is surely required here, where the critical new issue, i. e., whether petitioner, if at large, would constitute a danger of bodily harm to the public, is a complex and personal one going far beyond mere records and identification.</span></p>

It would seem reasonable, if not compelling, that in the "scheme of ordered liberty" established under the American Constitution and incorporated into state criminal procedure by the Fourteenth Amendment, offences of equivalent seriousness should not be subjected to significantly different procedures depending on whether the prosecution arose in a federal or state court. Importantly, however, there is nothing in the case to suggest that the right to a jury trial was intended to be extended to a postâconviction sentencing hearing where traditionally the jury has played no part.</span></p>

Typical of these cases is the frequently cited case of <i>U.S. v. Inendino</i>, 463 F.Supp. 252 (1978 N. D.

Duardi</i>, 384 F.Supp. 874 (W.D.Mo.1974), <i>affirmed on other grounds</i> 529 F.2d 123 (8th Cir. 1975). Dicta in the <i>Specht</i> case does support this view; for example, the Court points out that the statute requires a "new finding of fact" which results in "criminal punishment", and quotes from a lower court case holding that the defendant is entitled to "the full panoply" of criminal trial rights&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>

Minister of Employment and Immigration</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at pp. 212â13). It is also clear that the requirements of fundamental justice are not immutable; rather, they vary according to the context in which they are invoked. Thus, certain procedural protections might be constitutionally mandated in one context but not in another. Suffice it to say, however, that a jury determination is not mandated in the present context. The offender has already been found guilty of an offence in a trial at which he had the option of invoking his right to a jury. Moreover, the procedure to which he was subjected subsequent to the finding of guilt does not impact on his liberty to the same extent as that initial determination. Indeed, this is made clear by the same considerations that led this Court, in <i>Brusch</i>,<i> supra</i>, to classify the proceedings as part of the sentencing process. While the legal classification of the proceeding as part of the sentencing process does not necessarily decide the question of the scope of the procedural protection to be afforded the offender, the functional, factual considerations animating that conclusion must be taken into account.</span></p>

Given the severity of the impact of such review on a dangerous offender's liberty interests, at least as opposed to those of an "ordinary" offender, it seems to me that considerations of fundamental justice might require correspondingly enhanced procedural protections at such a review. In this regard, I note that the Ouimet Commission recommended that dangerous offenders be given a right to judicial review of their status every three years, with the court having the power to release the offender (<i>Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections </i>(1969), at pp. 262â63). I agree that this would afford the convict greater safeguards, but I do not view it to be constitutionally required. Indeed, as was pointed out by the court in both <i>Moore</i> and <i>Langevin</i>,<i> supra</i>, the Parole Board is supposedly more expert in determining whether release is warranted, and its decisions are subject to judicial review, including review on <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> grounds. However, the fairness of certain procedural aspects of a parole hearing may well be the subject of constitutional challenge, at least when the review is of the continued incarceration of a dangerous offender. The fairness of the review procedure, however, is not an issue in the present case.</span></p>

He contends, first, that s. 688, in requiring proof that the offender constitutes a <u>threat</u> to the life, safety or physical or mental wellâbeing of other persons, or that there is a <u>likelihood</u> of the offender causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons through a failure in the future to control his or her sexual impulses, is fundamentally unfair in that the standard of proof required of the Crown is lower than that traditionally required in the criminal law process. Secondly, he argues that s. 690, by requiring that psychiatric evidence be tendered on an application under Part XXI, is fundamentally unfair to the extent that such evidence is an unreliable predictor of future conduct.</span></p>

First, it is important to recognize exactly what is and what is not required to be proved on such an application.

Surely if we add "beyond a reasonable doubt" to a "future likelihood" the sum total can be no greater than a balance of probabilities; a standard we would never accept in a criminal trial.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">However, as Holmes has reminded us, the life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The criminal law must operate in a world governed by practical considerations rather than abstract logic and, as a matter of practicality, the most that can be established in a future context is a likelihood of certain events occurring. To doubt this conclusion is, in actuality, to doubt the validity of the legislative objectives embodied in Part XXI, for to require certainty in such matters would be tantamount to rendering the entire process ineffective.</span></p>

It seems to me that a "likelihood" of specified future conduct occurring is the finding of fact required to be established; it is not, at one and the same time, the means of proving that fact. Logically, it seems clear to me that an individual can be found to constitute a <u>threat</u> to society without insisting that this require the court to assert an ability to predict the future. I do not find it illogical for a court to assert that it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the test of dangerousness has been met, that there exists a <u>certain</u> potential for harm. That this is really only an apparent paradox is aptly captured by Morden J. in <i>R. v. Knight</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 343 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 356 :</span></p>

Counsel for the appellant cited both academic and judicial authority recognizing the inability of psychiatrists, or anyone else for that matter, to predict accurately future events. This is hardly a revelation. Indeed, the psychiatrists who testified at the hearing in the present case expressly disavowed any such claim.</span></p>

The test for admissibility is relevance, not infallibility. Judges at Part XXI hearings do not assume that psychiatrists can accurately predict the future; however, psychiatric evidence is clearly relevant to the issue whether a person is likely to behave in a certain way and, indeed, is probably relatively superior in this regard to the evidence of other clinicians and lay persons; see Menzies, Webster and Sepejak, "The Dimensions of Dangerousness" (1985), 9 <i>Law and Human Behaviour</i> 1:49.</span></p>

Two commentators summarized the results as follows: "Whatever may be said for the reliability and validity of psychiatric judgments in general, there is literally no evidence that psychiatrists reliably and accurately can predict dangerous behavior. To the contrary, such predictions are wrong more often than they are right." (Ennis &amp; Litwack, <i>Psychiatry and the Presumption of Expertise: Flipping Coins in the Courtroom</i> (1974), 62 Cal.L.Rev. 693, 737.) Professor Dershowitz in 1969 pointed to the skewed results characteristic of psychiatric forecasts: "it seems that psychiatrists are particularly prone to one type of errorââoverâprediction&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(F)or every correct psychiatric prediction of violence, there are numerous erroneous predictions." (Dershowitz, <i>The Psychiatrist's Power in Civil Commitment: A Knife That Cuts Both Ways</i> (Feb. 1969), Psych. Today, at p. 47.) Cocozza and Steadman in 1976 reviewed the various studies and reported that "Whether one examined the legal, behavioral science, or psychiatric literature on predictions of dangerousness, one constantly encounters conclusions similar to the one reached by Dershowitz that psychiatrists are generally inaccurate predictors." (Cocozza &amp; Steadman,<i> op. cit.</i>,<i> supra</i>, 29 Rutgers L.Rev. at p. 1085.) In 1978 Professor Monahan undertook a further review of studies of violence prediction and noted that the percentage of false positives (erroneous predictions that a subject would engage in violent behavior) never fell below 54 percentage and went as high as 99.7 percent. (Monahan, The Prediction and Control of Violent Behavior (1978), pp. 179â196, in Hearings Before the House Subcom. on Domestic and International Scientific Planning, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 175â252.)</span></p>

In its <i>Report of the Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders</i>, the Butler Commission recognized the difficulties in assessing dangerousness but nevertheless recommended that the British Parliament enact dangerous offender legislation with reviewable indeterminate sentences. It stated, at p. 60:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">. . . the fact that we cannot quantify the probability of future dangerous behaviour with actuarial precision is often allowed to obscure the fact that we can point with some confidence to categories of people who are more likely than others of the same sex and ageâgroup to act in this way. Some kinds of sexual offence seem to be very repetitive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Men with several convictions of violence are considerably more likely than their peers to be convicted of violence in the future. Again, it is sometimes argued that even if there are good groundsââclinical or actuarialââfor assigning the individual to a high risk group, he might be one of the minority in that group who in the event will not behave in accordance with probability. But this dilemma is inescapably involved in every decision which is based on probabilities. All that can be done is to weigh the unpleasantness of the consequences for the individual against the harm which he may do to others. If the harm is likely to be slight the decision should be in his favour: if great and highly probableââfor example, if a sexual offence is accompanied by serious violenceââthe best we can do is to make sure that the precautions are as humane as possible.</span></p>

It seems to me, however, that there is a limit beyond which it would be unseemly for courts to inquire into or `go beyond' such decisions of accused persons. For example, I do not think it would be proper to inquire into whether and to what extent the absence of such notice impaired the ability of the accused to plea bargain effectively, for "justice should not be, and should not be seen to be, something that can be purchased at the bargaining table" (Law Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper No. 15, <i>Criminal ProcedureââControl of the Process</i> (1975), at pp. 39â60).

It is nowhere alleged, here or in the courts below (where this issue was not even addressed), that the appellant did not appreciate the <u>potential</u> consequences of his plea; indeed, Part XXI itself can be seen to provide notification that the dangerous offender provisions are invocable if "serious personal injury offences" are committed by an accused. Nor is it alleged, for example, that the accused was unfairly taken by surprise by the application, that he was not represented by competent counsel, or that counsel pressured him to plead guilty against his will, etc. (see, e.g., <i>Lamoureux v. R.</i> (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 369 (Que. C.A.))

Section 7 guarantees the general right not to be deprived of one's life, liberty or security of the person except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Section 11 enumerates some of the principles of fundamental justice that apply in a particular context: where the person is "charged with an offence", the principles of fundamental justice include the particular guarantees set out in paras. (<i>a</i>) to (<i>i</i>) of s. 11. If the person is not "charged with an offence", it is necessary to determine the principles of fundamental justice applicable in that context.</span></p>

Generally speaking, a person is "charged with an offence" under s. 11 if and as of the moment that a formal allegation is made against him which, if found to be true, will give a judge jurisdiction to impose a criminal or penal sanction against him. Under Part XXI, if the court finds that the offender is a dangerous offender then, rather than imposing a determinate sentence within the limits provided for the offence for which the offender was convicted, the court may impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period. The conclusion that the offender is a dangerous offender gives the court jurisdiction to impose a greater sentence. The status of being a dangerous offender is thus in my view an offence for the purposes of s. 11 and the offender is charged with an offence when an application is brought under Part XXI. Furthermore, the purpose of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s. 11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">f<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is to guarantee that anyone in jeopardy of being sentenced to imprisonment for five years or more as a result of a determination of guilt has the right to have that determination made by a jury. To say that an application under Part XXI is not a charge of an offence violates in my respectful view the spirit of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and leaves without that protection offered most persons in jeopardy when charged with an indictable offence those put in one of the most serious jeopardies our law has created.</span></p>

First, it is said that the accepted view in Canada is that the Part XXI procedure is not a separate offence but is simply part of the sentencing process with respect to the serious personal injury offence for which the offender was convicted. Two decisions of this Court, <i>Brusch v. The Queen</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373 and <i>Wilband v. The Queen</i>, [1967] S.C.R. 14, support this proposition. In addition, the postâ<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> cases of <i>R. v. Simon (No. 2)</i> (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 478 (N.W.T.S.C.), and <i>R. v. Langevin</i> (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336 (Ont. C.A.), held that s. 11 is not applicable to proceedings under Part XXI. The wording of Part XXI and the fact that it follows immediately the part of the <i>Code</i> entitled "Punishments, Fines, Forfeitures, Costs and Restitution of Property" are also indications that Part XXI relates to sentencing. None of this, however, is conclusive. The preâ<i>Charter</i> decisions of this Court are not, of course, determinative of the scope of <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights, but they do carry some weight (see <i>R. v. Therens</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, at pp. 637â40). The same is true of the postâ<i>Charter</i> decisions of lower courts. Finally, it is not the form of the challenged provisions but rather their substance which must be considered. It is clear that Parliament, when enacting Part XXI, wanted this issue to be treated as part of the sentencing process, but the question is not what was intended but whether it falls within the letter and spirit of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. In my view, Part XXI is very different from sentencing provisions. A conviction gives the judge jurisdiction to impose a determinate sentence between the minimum and the maximum (if any) set out in the provision creating the offence. The judge will make further findings of fact to help him decide which sentence within that permitted range should be imposed. The permitted range of sentences is not affected by these findings of fact. Thus, a conviction for a serious personal injury offence gives the judge jurisdiction to impose a determinate sentence. Under Part XXI, however, the further finding of fact that the offender is a dangerous offender gives the judge jurisdiction to impose a different and more severe sentence. It is not simply a finding made in the exercise of his jurisdiction to impose a sentence but it is a finding that gives him new jurisdiction to impose a more severe sentence, indeed a drastically more severe sentence. It is the finding of dangerousness and not the conviction for the personal injury offence that gives the judge jurisdiction to impose an indeterminate sentence. The conviction for the serious personal injury offence is the basis for commencing the proceedings under Part XXI but, in my respectful view, Part XXI cannot be characterized as simply part of the sentencing process with respect to the serious personal injury offence. Part XXI involves the imposition of a punishment greater than that provided for the serious personal injury offence after a new finding of fact, and is thus a separate offence.</span></p>

Schmidt</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500. In that case, it is stated that s. 11 must be restricted to circumstances in which all of the rights set out in s. 11 are applicable. It is suggested here that the presumption of innocence (s. 11(<i>d</i>)) and the right to reasonable bail (s. 11(<i>e</i>)) cannot have any application in the context of a Part XXI proceeding and that, as a result, s. 11 does not apply. With respect, I disagree. In my view, the offender against whom an application under Part XXI is brought has the right to be presumed not dangerous until the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he is dangerous. The preâ<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> case law imposed such a burden on the Crown: <i>R. v. Jackson</i> (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 540 (N.S.C.A.) The mere fact that the terminology of guilt and innocence is awkward in the context of Part XXI must not interfere with this fundamental right. The right to bail in s. 11(<i>e</i>) is not absolute but is rather the right "not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause". In the context of Part XXI, the offender will just have been convicted of a serious personal injury offence such that there will always exist a just cause for denying bail. This does not mean, however, that s. 11(<i>e</i>) has no application to Part XXI proceedings. All it means is that the norm set out in s. 11(<i>e</i>) will seldom enure to the benefit of the offender, as is the case with respect to many other offences set out in the <i>Code</i>, such as premeditated murder. I would thus conclude that an offender against whom an application under Part XXI is brought is entitled to the guarantees set out in s. 11.</span></p>

As a result, the offender is entitled to the benefit of a jury's determination of dangerousness. Section 689(2) of the <i>Code</i>, which provides that an application under Part XXI shall be heard and determined by the court without a jury, clearly restricts this right and must be declared inoperative unless it can be saved under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec1" target="_blank">s. 1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

The determination which the jury would be called upon to make under Part XXI is not unlike other determinations which juries make regularly and cannot be said to be beyond the competence of a jury. There is no evidence of any serious administrative problems which would be created by the presence of a jury at that stage of the proceedings. In effect, there is no suggestion that the failure to provide a jury is meant to serve any objective "of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom" (<i>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295 at p. 352) or relates to "concerns which are pressing and substantial" (<i>R. v. Oakes</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 138â39).

The appellant does not allege that he was prejudiced in his defence to the Part XXI application because of any insufficiency of the notice and the notice appears to me to be sufficient for the Part XXI proceedings. Rather, he argues that he should have been given notice of the Crown's intention to proceed under Part XXI before his election and plea on the serious personal injury offence. It might well be that lack of notice violates an accused's rights under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> in regard of his trial for the serious personal injury offence. However, if the appellant is alleging that he was prejudiced in making his election and plea, then his remedy under s. 24(1) would be to challenge the proceedings leading to that conviction and to have it struck so that he could elect and plead accordingly. He has not, however, made any such allegation, challenged that conviction or sought any such remedy, so it is unnecessary to consider whether we would have granted any remedy.</span></p>

I would remit the matter to the County Court so that the appellant can elect whether he wants the determination of dangerousness made by a judge alone or by a judge and jury. I should note in passing that there is no difficulty in this case because the trial court for the serious personal injury offence can sit with a jury. However, legislation may be necessary in cases where the trial court cannot sit with a jury.</span></p>

I leave open the question whether a person against whom a Part XXI application is brought is a "person charged with an offence" within the meaning of s. 11. It is not necessary for me to decide this since I find that the appellant is protected by the more general provision of s. 7.</span></p>

Common sense impels me to the conclusion that the thought uppermost in an accused's mind in deciding whether to plead guilty or stand upon his right to be presumed innocent until proved otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt by the Crown is: what is the worst that can happen to me if I am convicted of this offence? I think we have to ask ourselves the following question: had this accused known at the time he pleaded guilty that the Crown would be seeking an order of preventive detention against him for an indeterminate period, would he have pleaded guilty? If the answer to that question is probably not, then I think the accused is entitled to the protection of s. 7 unless knowledge of his exposure to such an order under Part XXI of the <i>Code </i>can properly be attributed to him simply by virtue of its presence in the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">128.</span><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have concluded that such knowledge cannot be attributed to the accused. The <i>Code </i>expressly contemplates that notice will be given to the accused of the Crown's intention to make a Part XXI application. True, it is only required to be given seven days following the making of the application (s. 689(1)(<i>b</i>)) which is itself to be made "following the conviction of a person for an offence but before the offender is sentenced therefor" (s. 688). But I find this helpful rather than harmful in considering whether the appellant should have envisaged such an application at the time he made his plea. I would think also that the fact that such applications are rare and probably even rarer in the case of 16âyearâolds would make it unrealistic to attribute such knowledge to appellant's counsel and, through him, to the appellant.</span></p>

He states at p. 378:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
letter-spacing:-.15pt">It might well be that lack of notice violates an accused's rights under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>in regard of his trial for the serious personal injury offence. However, if the appellant is alleging that he was prejudiced in making his election and plea, then his remedy under s. 24(1) would be to challenge the proceedings leading to that conviction and to have it struck so that he could elect and plead accordingly. He has not, however, made any such allegation, challenged that conviction or sought any such remedy, so it is unnecessary to consider whether we would have granted any remedy.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">130.</span><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my respectful view, it was open to the appellant to challenge his conviction or to make no attack on his conviction but challenge the order under Part XXI. He has gone the latter route. The accused may well have concluded that he was not prejudiced so far as the finding of guilt was concerned by the fact that his guilty plea was made in the absence of notice or knowledge that the Crown intended to seek such an order, but that he was prejudiced with respect to the making of the order. La Forest J. points out in his reasons that the order of preventive detention was additional punishment for the offence. I see no reason, therefore, why the accused should not take the position that he could properly be sentenced to the maximum determinate sentence if this was thought appropriate because this he could and ought to have envisaged, but that in pleading guilty he did not and could not have envisaged the making of the Part XXI order. This does not, however, mean that he must attack his conviction and that, if he does not do so, the Court cannot grant him a s. 24(1) remedy in relation to the order of preventive detention. This would be a very restrictive approach to <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>remedies. The appellant might well have felt that he would not succeed in a claim under s. 24(1) to set his conviction aside, that the Court would not view this as the appropriate and just remedy in the circumstances, but that it might consider it appropriate and just to set aside the order for additional punishment. I would resist any suggestion that an accused alleging a violation of his <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights must claim all or nothing.</span></p>
