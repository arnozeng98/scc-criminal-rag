Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, the declarant’s motive to lie in <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, and most relevant to this case, the striking similarities between statements in <i>R. v. U.

In support of this finding, he noted that there was “nothing untoward in the police procedure in taking the statements” and, although three of the complainants’ statements were taken at the retirement home, rather than at the police station, he found that the “circumstances of taking the statements [were] as formal and solemn as could be expected in the situation”.&nbsp; He noted that there was “no animosity directed at the accused” by the complainants in their statements other than voicing their complaint.&nbsp; The complainants “appeared forthright”, they were “not evasive”, and they did not “attempt to overstate their injuries”.&nbsp; There were no “exceedingly leading” questions and, to the extent that there was leading, it went to weight rather than admissibility.&nbsp; All the statements were contemporaneous or made shortly after the events that they described.&nbsp; They knew their assailant well and there was no realistic alternative suspect.&nbsp; Further, both Mr. Skupien and Mr. Dinino had corroborating injuries.</p>

U. (F.J.)</i>”, he held, citing para. 217 in <i>Starr</i> as authority, that “to admit them would be oath-helping in that I have the video statements”.</p>

(F.J.)</i> exception.&nbsp; He also found that the exception could apply where the statements related to different events, stating that, for the purpose of finding threshold reliability, he could see no “logical difference” between statements concerning the same accused “doing the same thing on the same occasion” and “the same accused doing the same thing on different occasions” (para.&nbsp;48), drawing on the rationale for similar-fact reasoning, since both involve admitting evidence on the basis of the “improbability of coincidence” (para. 49).&nbsp; Finally, he found that a finding that the comparator statements are not substantively admissible should not exclude them from the reliability analysis, pointing out that otherwise reliable statements could be held inadmissible for a variety of reasons, including a finding that they were not necessary (para. 53).</p>

Abbey</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at pp. 40-41, <i>per</i> Dickson J.&nbsp; It is sufficient to note, as this Court did in <i>Starr</i>, at para.&nbsp;159, that the more recent definitions of hearsay are focussed on the central concern underlying the hearsay rule:&nbsp; the difficulty of testing the reliability of the declarant’s assertion.&nbsp; See, for example, <i>R. v. O’Brien</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 591, at pp. 593‑94.&nbsp; Our adversary system puts a premium on the calling of witnesses, who testify under oath or solemn affirmation, whose demeanour can be observed by the trier of fact, and whose testimony can be tested by cross-examination.&nbsp; We regard this process as the optimal way of testing testimonial evidence.&nbsp; Because hearsay evidence comes in a different form, it raises particular concerns.&nbsp; The general exclusionary rule is a recognition of the difficulty for a trier of fact to assess what weight, if any, is to be given to a statement made by a person who has not been seen or heard, and who has not been subject to the test of cross-examination.&nbsp; The fear is that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it deserves.&nbsp; The essential defining features of hearsay are therefore the following:&nbsp; (1) the fact that the statement is adduced to prove the truth of its contents and (2) the absence of a contemporaneous opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.&nbsp; I will deal with each defining feature in turn.</p>

Hence, only in the latter circumstance is the evidence about the caller’s statement defined as hearsay and subject to the general exclusionary rule.</p>

Rather, these cases provide guidance — not fixed categories — on the application of the principled case-by-case approach by identifying the relevant concerns and the factors to be considered in determining admissibility.</p>

However, the traditional rules of evidence reflect considerable wisdom and judicial experience.&nbsp; The modern approach has built upon their underlying rationale, not discarded it.&nbsp; In <i>Starr</i> itself, where this Court recognized the primacy of the principled approach to hearsay exceptions, the presumptive exclusion of hearsay evidence was reaffirmed in strong terms.&nbsp; Iacobucci J. stated as follows (at para. 199):</p>

Wilcox </i>(2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 157, 2001 NSCA 45; <i>R. v. Czibulka</i> (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 199 (Ont. C.A.); D. M.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
33.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">There are many situations in which it can be easily seen that such a required test [i.e., cross-examination] would add little as a security, because its purposes had been already substantially accomplished.&nbsp; If a statement has been made under such circumstances that even a sceptical caution would look upon it as trustworthy (in the ordinary instance), in a high degree of probability, it would be pedantic to insist on a test whose chief object is already secured.

Recall that the optimal way of testing evidence adopted by our adversarial system is to have the declarant state the evidence in court, under oath, and under the scrutiny of contemporaneous cross-examination.&nbsp; This preferred method is not just a vestige of past traditions. It remains a tried and true method, particularly when credibility issues must be resolved.&nbsp; It is one thing for a person to make a damaging statement about another in a context where it may not really matter. It is quite another for that person to repeat the statement in the course of formal proceedings where he or she must commit to its truth and accuracy, be observed and heard, and be called upon to explain or defend it.&nbsp; The latter situation, in addition to providing an accurate record of what was actually said by the witness, gives us a much higher degree of comfort in the statement’s trustworthiness.&nbsp; However, in some cases it is not possible to put the evidence to the optimal test, but the circumstances are such that the trier of fact will nonetheless be able to sufficiently test its truth and accuracy.&nbsp; Again, common sense tells us that we should not lose the benefit of the evidence when there are adequate substitutes for testing the evidence.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

However, the child’s statement had several characteristics that suggested the statement was true.&nbsp; Those characteristics answered many of the concerns that one would expect would be inquired into in testing the evidence, had it been available for presentation in open court in the usual way.&nbsp; McLachlin J., in the following oft-quoted statement, summarized them in this way:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The facts also revealed that the statement was made almost immediately after the event. That feature removed any concern about inaccurate memory.&nbsp; The fact that the child had no reason to lie alleviated the concern about sincerity.&nbsp; Because the statement was made naturally and without prompting, there was no real danger that it came about because of the mother’s influence.&nbsp; Most importantly, as stated in the above excerpt, the event described was one that would ordinarily be outside the experience of a child of her age giving it a “peculiar stamp of reliability”.&nbsp; Finally, the statement was confirmed by a semen stain on the child’s clothing.&nbsp; These characteristics each went to the truth and accuracy of the statement and, taken together, amply justified its admission.

(K.G.) </i>is one example.&nbsp; As noted by Lamer&nbsp;C.J., “[p]rior inconsistent statements present vexing problems for the necessity criterion” (p. 796).&nbsp; Indeed, the declarant is available as a witness.&nbsp; Why should not the usual rule apply and the recanting witness’s sworn testimony alone go to the truth of the matter?&nbsp; After all, is that not the optimal test on reliability — that the witness come forth to be seen and heard, swear or affirm to tell the truth in the formal context of court proceedings, and be subjected to cross-examination?&nbsp; If a witness recants a prior statement and denies its truth, the default position is to conclude that the trial process has worked as intended — untruthful or inaccurate information will have been weeded out.&nbsp; There must be good reason to present the prior inconsistent statement as substantive proof over the sworn testimony given in court.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
33.65pt;line-height:24.4pt"><i>Khan</i> and <i>Smith</i> establish that hearsay evidence will be substantively admissible when it is necessary and sufficiently reliable.&nbsp; Those cases also state that both necessity and reliability must be interpreted flexibly, taking account of the circumstances of the case and ensuring that our new approach to hearsay does not itself become a rigid pigeon-holing analysis. My decision in <i>B. (K.G.)</i> is an application of those principles to a particular branch of the hearsay rule, the rule against the substantive admission of prior inconsistent statements.&nbsp; The primary distinction between <i>B. (K.G.)</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Khan</i> and <i>Smith</i>, on the other, is that in <i>B. (K.G.)</i> the declarant is available for cross-examination.&nbsp; This fact alone goes part of the way to ensuring that the reliability criterion for admissibility is met.&nbsp; The case at bar differs from <i>B. (K.G.)</i> only in terms of available indicia of reliability.&nbsp; Necessity is met here in the same way it was met in <i>B. (K.G.)</i>:&nbsp; the prior statement is necessary because evidence of the same quality cannot be obtained at trial.&nbsp; For that reason, assessing the reliability of the prior inconsistent statement at issue here is determinative.</p>

(K.G.)</i>.&nbsp; The complainant’s statement to the police was not made under oath.&nbsp; Nor was it videotaped.&nbsp; Most importantly, however, the declarant was available for cross-examination, thereby significantly alleviating the usual dangers arising from the introduction of hearsay evidence.&nbsp; Yet, the same concerns about the reliability of the prior inconsistent statement arose in this case.&nbsp; The complainant had recanted her earlier allegations.&nbsp; In the usual course of the trial process, this should be the end of the matter.&nbsp; Consider, for example, if the complainant had made the earlier allegations about being sexually assaulted by her father to some girlfriends in the context of playing a game of “Truth or Dare” where each player was being encouraged to outdo the previous one by saying or doing something outrageous. It would be difficult to find justification for introducing her casual statement as substantive proof over her sworn testimony that the events never happened.&nbsp; Hence, the focus must turn on the reliability of the prior inconsistent statement.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
33.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">For these reasons, we find that a witness’s recorded testimony before a preliminary inquiry bears sufficient hallmarks of trustworthiness to permit the trier of fact to make substantive use of such statements at trial.&nbsp; The surrounding circumstances of such testimony, particularly the presence of an oath or affirmation and the opportunity for contemporaneous cross‑examination, more than adequately compensate for the trier of fact’s inability to observe the demeanour of the witness in court.&nbsp; The absence of the witness at trial goes to the weight of such testimony, not to its admissibility.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
33.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">I see no constitutional justification for this decision to prescind corroborating evidence from consideration of the question whether a child’s statements are reliable.&nbsp; It is a matter of common sense for most people that one of the best ways to determine whether what someone says is trustworthy is to see if it is corroborated by other evidence.&nbsp; In the context of child abuse, for example, if part of the child’s hearsay statement is that the assailant tied her wrists or had a scar on his lower abdomen, and there is physical evidence or testimony to corroborate the child’s statement, evidence which the child could not have fabricated, we are more likely to believe that what the child says is true.&nbsp; Conversely, one can imagine a situation in which a child makes a statement which is spontaneous or is otherwise made under circumstances indicating that it is reliable, but which also contains undisputed factual inaccuracies so great that the credibility of the child’s statements is substantially undermined. Under the Court’s analysis, the statement would satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause despite substantial doubt about its reliability. [pp. 828-29]</p>

33.65pt;line-height:12.2pt">The [majority] does not offer any justification for barring the consideration of corroborating evidence, other than the suggestion that corroborating evidence does not bolster the “inherent trustworthiness” of the statements. But for purposes of determining the reliability of the statements, I can discern no difference between the factors that the Court believes indicate “inherent trustworthiness” and those, like corroborating evidence, that apparently do not.&nbsp; Even the factors endorsed by the Court will involve consideration of the very evidence the Court purports to exclude from the reliability analysis.&nbsp; The Court notes that one test of reliability is whether the child “use[d] . . . terminology unexpected of a child of similar age.”&nbsp; But making this determination requires consideration of the child’s vocabulary skills and past opportunity, or lack thereof, to learn the terminology at issue.&nbsp; And, when all of the extrinsic circumstances of a case are considered, it may be shown that use of a particular word or vocabulary in fact supports the inference of prolonged contact with the defendant, who was known to use the vocabulary in question.&nbsp; As a further example, the Court notes that motive to fabricate is an index of reliability.&nbsp; But if the suspect charges that a third person concocted a false case against him and coached the child, surely it is relevant to show that the third person had no contact with the child or no opportunity to suggest false testimony.&nbsp; Given the contradictions inherent in the Court’s test when measured against its own examples, I expect its holding will soon prove to be as unworkable as it is illogical.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
33.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The short of the matter is that both the circumstances existing at the time the child makes the statements and the existence of corroborating evidence indicate, to a greater or lesser degree, whether the statements are reliable. If the Court means to suggest that the circumstances surrounding the making of a statement are the best indicators of reliability, I doubt this is so in every instance.&nbsp; And, if it were true in a particular case, that does not warrant ignoring other indicators of reliability such as corroborating evidence, absent some other reason for excluding it.&nbsp; If anything, I should think that corroborating evidence in the form of testimony or physical evidence, apart from the narrow circumstances in which the statement was made, would be a preferred means of determining a statement’s reliability for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, for the simple reason that, unlike other indicators of trustworthiness, corroborating evidence can be addressed by the defendant and assessed by the trial court in an objective and critical way.&nbsp; [References omitted; pp. 833-34.]</p>

33.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The final rationale offered is that it would involve “bootstrapping” to admit evidence simply because it is shown by other evidence to be reliable.&nbsp; In fact, the “bootstrapping” label is usually reserved to circular arguments in which a questionable piece of evidence “picks itself up by its own bootstraps” to fit within an exception.&nbsp; For example, a party claims it can rely on a hearsay statement because the statement was made under such pressure or involvement that the prospect of concoction can fairly be disregarded, but then relies on the contents of the hearsay statement to prove the existence of that pressure or involvement [<i>Ratten v. R.</i>, [1972] A.C. 378 (P.C.)].&nbsp; Or, a party claims it can rely on the truth of the contents of a statement because it was a statement made by an opposing party litigant, but then relies on the contents of the statement to prove it was made by an opposing party litigant:&nbsp; see <i>R. v. Evans</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869.&nbsp; Looking to <i>other</i> evidence to confirm the reliability of evidence, the thing <i>Idaho v.

Necessity is conceded.&nbsp; However, in an appropriate case, the court in deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the proponent of the evidence made all reasonable efforts to secure the evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the other party.&nbsp; That issue is not raised here.</p>

(K.G.) </i>situation where the presence of an oath and a video were coupled with the availability of the declarant at trial.&nbsp; There are no adequate substitutes here for testing the evidence.&nbsp; There is the police video — nothing more.&nbsp; The principled exception to the hearsay rule does not provide a vehicle for founding a conviction on the basis of a police statement, videotaped or otherwise, without more. In order to meet the reliability requirement in this case, the Crown could only rely on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement.</p>

This was not a situation as in <i>Khan</i> where the cogency of the evidence was such that, in the words of Wigmore, it would be “pedantic to insist on a test whose chief object is already secured” (<span style="font-family:&quot;WP Phonetic&quot;">_</span> 1420, at p. 154).&nbsp; To the contrary, much as in the case of the third statement ruled inadmissible in <i>Smith</i>, the circumstances raised a number of serious issues such that it would be impossible to say that the evidence was unlikely to change under cross‑examination.&nbsp; Mr. Skupien was elderly and frail.&nbsp; His mental capacity was at issue — the medical records contained repeated diagnoses of paranoia and dementia. There was also the possibility that his injuries were caused by a fall rather than an assault — the medical records revealed a number of complaints of fatigue, weakness and dizziness and the examining physician, Dr. Pietraszek, testified that the injuries could have resulted from a fall (A.R., vol. II, at p. 259).&nbsp; The evidence of the garbage bags filled with Mr. Skupien’s possessions provided little assistance in assessing the likely truth of his statement — he could have filled those bags himself.&nbsp; Ms. Stangrat’s obvious motive to discredit Mr. Khelawon presented further difficulties.&nbsp; The initial allegations were made to her — Dr. Pietraszek acknowledged in his evidence that when he saw Mr. Skupien, Ms. Stangrat was present and may have helped him by giving some indication of what happened.&nbsp; The extent to which Mr. Skupien may have been influenced in making his statement by this disgruntled employee was a live issue.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Skupien had issues of his own with the way the retirement home was managed. This is apparent from his rambling complaints on the police video itself.&nbsp; The absence of an oath and the simple “yes” in answer to the police officer’s question as to whether he understood that it was important to tell the truth do not give much insight on whether he truly understood the consequences for Mr. Khelawon of making his statement.&nbsp; In these circumstances, Mr. Skupien’s unavailability for cross-examination posed significant limitations on the accused’s ability to test the evidence and, in turn, on the trier of fact’s ability to properly assess its worth.</p>

The Court of Appeal unanimously ruled them inadmissible.</p>
