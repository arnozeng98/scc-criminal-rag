G denied any involvement in the murder, and sought to adduce evidence to suggest that, based on the <i>modus operandi</i> and other physical evidence, D‚Äôs abductor had also abducted W while G was in custody.</p>

margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having found that the same legal test applied to the admissibility of known third party suspect evidence and unknown third party suspect evidence, the trial judge concluded on a balance of probabilities that the alleged abduction of W had not happened. He refused to admit the evidence. G was convicted of second degree murder by the jury. The Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded that G should have been permitted to lead the evidence, allowed his appeal and ordered a new trial.</p>

margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the tests governing known third party suspect evidence and similar fact evidence may provide useful insights into the underlying concerns and principles, they should not be stretched beyond the particular circumstances that they were designed to address. Instead, first principles governing the admissibility of evidence properly balance the competing interests that arise when the defence seeks to lead evidence of an unknown third party suspect.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defence-led <span style="line-height:200%">evidence</span> is admissible where (1) the evidence is relevant to a fact in issue, and (2) the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects. The trial judge must therefore first determine whether the evidence is logically relevant to an available defence. Where the defence‚Äôs theory is that an unknown third party committed the indicted crime, this factual foundation will be established by a sufficient connection between the crime for which the accused is charged and the allegedly similar incident(s) suggesting that the crimes were committed by the same person, coupled with evidence that the accused could not have committed the other offence. Once a sufficient connection is shown, the evidence will be admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its probative value. This assessment is inherently individualized, and is capable of responding to various levels and forms of prejudice. It does not require the accused to satisfy a higher admissibility threshold or require the trial judge to engage in an enhanced evaluation of the evidence. The trial judge may not invade the province of the jury and determine the strength of the evidence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge erred in law in treating the evidence relating to the alleged abduction of W as known third party suspect evidence and in requiring G to establish on a balance of probabilities that the alleged abduction of W took place.&nbsp; These errors entitled the Court of Appeal to conduct its own assessment of the evidence. It was entitled to conclude that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the alleged crime against W had occurred and, having regard to the similarities, that it had been committed by the same person who killed D. The evidence that G could not have committed the offence against W and the evidence of similarities between the two offences would have provided some evidence capable of giving the unknown third party suspect defence an air of reality. While an appellate court is entitled to step into the shoes of the trial judge if the record permits, in this case, the Court of Appeal was not in the position to assess and weigh the extent of the probative value and the extent of prejudicial effect of the unknown third party suspect evidence. The trial judge‚Äôs legal errors were clearly not minor, and do not attract the application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. The verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the trial judge applied the correct principles in determining the test for the admissibility of this defence evidence. As this case must be re-tried in any event, the balancing of the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the evidence is best left for the trial judge.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[1]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2007, the respondent, Mark Edward Grant, was charged with the first degree murder of Candace Derksen, a notorious cold-case murder that occurred in Winnipeg, Manitoba, almost 23 years earlier.&nbsp; The Crown‚Äôs case depended substantially on the recent analysis of small quantities of DNA found at the scene of the crime.&nbsp; Mr. Grant challenged the DNA evidence and sought to lead evidence suggesting that an unknown third party suspect had committed the crime.&nbsp; The trial judge refused to admit the evidence of an allegedly similar offence committed within months of the Derksen murder, while Mr. Grant was in custody on an unrelated matter.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; Mr. Grant was subsequently convicted of second degree murder by the jury.&nbsp; The Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded that Mr. Grant should have been permitted to lead the evidence.&nbsp; It allowed his conviction appeal and ordered a new trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues before this Court are the appropriate framework for determining the admissibility of defence-led evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect, and to what extent this framework requires the trial judge to assess and weigh the evidence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the identification of an accused as the perpetrator of the crime charged is essential to establishing criminal liability.&nbsp; The burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person before the court is the guilty party rests squarely on the Crown.&nbsp; In accordance with the presumption of innocence, the accused is never required to prove her innocence.&nbsp; An accused person‚Äôs <i>Charter-</i>protected right to make full answer and defence entitles her to challenge the Crown‚Äôs case and lead evidence to raise a reasonable doubt about whether the accused committed the crime.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the accused‚Äôs rights are not the only interests at stake.&nbsp; The integrity of the administration of justice requires that the proceedings stay focused on the indicted crime and not devolve into trials within a trial about matters that may not be sufficiently connected to the case.&nbsp; Such tangents risk causing delays, confusion and distractions that undermine the trial‚Äôs truth-seeking function.&nbsp; This risk is especially heightened where the defence seeks to introduce other alleged suspects or crimes into the trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agree that balancing these interests requires the trial judge to evaluate the probative value of defence-led evidence of an unknown third party suspect against the elevated risks it poses to the integrity of the trial, but disagree about what this evaluation entails.&nbsp; The appellant the Manitoba Prosecution Service (the Crown) says that the trial judge must apply the stringent admissibility tests developed for known third party suspect and similar fact evidence.&nbsp; The defence maintains that these tests place an unfair burden on the accused and that the general rules of admissibility adequately address the issues of relevance, probative value and prejudicial effects.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is not helpful to slot evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect into categories that were not designed to accommodate it.&nbsp; While the tests governing known third party suspect evidence and similar fact evidence may provide useful insights into the underlying concerns and principles, they should not be stretched beyond the particular circumstances that they were designed to address.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, first principles governing the admissibility of evidence properly balance the competing interests that arise when the defence seeks to lead evidence of an unknown third party suspect.&nbsp; In such cases, the defence must first establish the logical relevance of the evidence.&nbsp; This may be done by demonstrating a sufficient connection ‚Äï or similarity ‚Äï between the crime charged and another crime the accused could not possibly have committed to support the logical inference that the same person committed both crimes.&nbsp; Once this threshold is met, the evidence will be admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its probative value (<i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, I conclude that the trial judge erred in evaluating and assessing the credibility of the unknown third party suspect evidence on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; I agree with the Court of Appeal that a new trial is required.</p>

Grandinetti</i>, 2005 SCC 5, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27, applies equally to admissibility of both unknown third party suspect evidence and known third party suspect evidence.&nbsp; Thus, evidence of an unknown third party suspect could be ‚Äúadmitted only after some threshold evidence ha[d] been demonstrated respecting a link between the third party, known or unknown, and the crime before the court‚Äù (trial transcript, A.R., vol. III, at p. 48).&nbsp; The trial judge also referred to this Court‚Äôs jurisprudence for similar fact evidence and, specifically, to <i>R. v. Handy</i>,<i> </i>2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the documentary and testimonial evidence adduced on the <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge found that he was ‚Äúnot, even on a balance of probabilities, able to conclude that the alleged offence [against P.W.] happened‚Äù (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 8-9).&nbsp; As a result, he found there could be no unknown third party suspect and thus ‚Äúno useable similarities‚Äù (p. 9).&nbsp; The trial judge concluded that the evidence was not sufficiently probative to justify the impact its admission would have on the length and complexity of the trial, and ordered that the defence not make any reference to the P.W. incident.</p>
 <p class="Title2LevelTitre2Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">B.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Manitoba Court of Appeal, 2013 MBCA 95, 299 Man. R. (2d) 202</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Mr. Grant appealed his conviction and brought a motion to adduce fresh evidence relating to DNA analysis and juror bias.&nbsp; After rejecting several grounds relating to the conviction, Monnin J.A., writing for the court, held that the trial judge erred in not allowing Mr. Grant to lead evidence relating to an alleged unknown third party suspect (paras. 9-10, 78).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge made factual and credibility findings that ‚Äúhe was not entitled to make‚Äù in determining admissibility and that he relied ‚Äúalmost exclusively on the <i>viva voce</i> evidence of P.W. to the exclusion of all of the other evidence before him, including P.W.‚Äôs two prior statements‚Äù (para. 68).&nbsp; The trial judge erred in applying the balance of probabilities standard to determine whether the P.W. incident occurred; he should have instead applied the <i>Seaboyer </i>test that broadly governs the admissibility of defence-led evidence (paras. 73-74).&nbsp; Furthermore, in determining whether the defence theory had an air of reality, all that was required was ‚Äúsome evidence‚Äù that could leave a jury with a reasonable doubt as to the accused‚Äôs guilt (para. 68).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal characterized the evidence tendered in this case as ‚Äúmore akin to similar-fact evidence‚Äù than to known third party suspect evidence (para. 72).&nbsp; However, the court concluded that the test applicable to Crown-led similar fact evidence does not apply when such evidence is advanced by an accused; rather, defence-led similar fact evidence is admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its probative value, in accordance with <i>Seaboyer</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[17]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal concluded that the evidence pertaining to the P.W. incident was ‚Äúvery relevant‚Äù and ‚Äúpointed to the possibility that the same person who killed Candace Derksen abducted P.W., if the jury so found that to have occurred‚Äù (para. 70).&nbsp; As Mr. Grant was in custody at the time of the P.W. incident, this evidence ‚Äúcould provide the basis upon which a reasonable, properly instructed jury could acquit‚Äù (<i>ibid.</i>).&nbsp; The court concluded that, since the prejudicial effects of the evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value, Mr. Grant should have been permitted to place the evidence of the P.W. incident before the jury (para. 78).&nbsp; The court noted<i> </i>that this evidence was also relevant in assessing the evidence of the defence DNA expert that excluded Mr. Grant as a suspect.&nbsp; The accused was denied his opportunity to make full answer, and this legal error was sufficient to set aside the conviction and order a new trial.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The truth-seeking function of the trial creates a starting premise that all relevant evidence is admissible (<i>R. v. L. (D.O.)</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419; <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670).&nbsp; Evidence is logically relevant where it has any tendency to prove or disprove a fact in issue (<i>Corbett</i>, at p. 715).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, not all relevant evidence is admissible.&nbsp; The trial judge must also balance the probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effects of its admission (<i>R. v. No</i><i>√´</i><i>l</i>, 2002 SCC 67, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 433; <i>Corbett</i>; <i>Sweitzer v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949; <i>Seaboyer</i>; <i>R. v. Harrer</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562).&nbsp; Evidence led by the Crown will be excluded where its prejudicial effects outweigh its probative value (<i>Seaboyer</i>).&nbsp; The presumption of the accused‚Äôs innocence leads us to strike a different balance where defence-led evidence is concerned.&nbsp; As this Court explained in <i>Seaboyer</i>, ‚Äúthe prejudice must substantially outweigh the value of the evidence before a judge can exclude evidence relevant to a defence allowed by law‚Äù (p. 611; see also <i><span style="line-height:200%">R. v. Shearing</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33; <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129).</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">The requirement that there be a sufficient connection between the third party and the crime is essential.&nbsp; Without this link, the third party evidence is neither relevant nor probative.&nbsp; The evidence may be inferential, but the inferences must be reasonable, based on the evidence, and not amount to speculation.&nbsp; [para. 47]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that the substantial prejudice arising from evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect requires a higher threshold for both admissibility and putting the defence to the jury.&nbsp; However, substantial prejudice does not require a higher threshold; it simply weighs heavier in the balance.&nbsp; The <i>Seaboyer</i> admissibility test does not presuppose a particular level of prejudice or probative value for certain categories of evidence; instead, it requires a trial judge to conduct the balancing process contextually, based on the particularities of the evidence before her.&nbsp; As an inherently individualized assessment, it is capable of responding to various levels and forms of prejudice.&nbsp; No other test or higher threshold is required to protect the integrity of the trial process.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same is true of the ‚Äúsome evidence‚Äù threshold in the air of reality test, which the Crown argues the Court of Appeal erred in applying in this case.&nbsp; This standard does not indirectly lower the threshold for unknown third party suspect evidence.&nbsp; Rather, this standard, when used in conjunction with the requirement for a sufficient connection between the crimes, respects the requirements of <i>Corbett</i>, <i>Seaboyer </i>and <i>Cinous</i>, and properly balances the integrity of the trial process with the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion does not, as the Crown submits it would, increase the scope of the Crown‚Äôs potential disclosure obligations such that compliance becomes impossible.&nbsp; The Crown continues to be required to disclose all relevant evidence to the defence (<i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at pp. 336-40).&nbsp; The application of the <i>Stinchcombe </i>test obviously depends on the circumstances of each case and each disclosure request.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[50]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the disclosure request was based on notes by the lead investigator in the police file on the Derksen murder concerning a similar crime (the P.W. incident) that was ‚Äúvery probably‚Äù connected to the Derksen murder (A.R., vol. II, at p. 135).&nbsp; The evidence for which disclosure was sought was clearly relevant.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the similarities or the temporal or geographic connections between the charged crime and the crime(s) for which disclosure is sought are insufficient, the evidence will not be relevant, and disclosure will not be required.&nbsp; Allowing the defence to establish a sufficient connection with reference to the crimes, rather than to the suspect, does not extend the Crown‚Äôs duty of disclosure.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does this conclusion jeopardize the Crown‚Äôs ability to protect the privacy interests of individuals implicated in unrelated criminal matters or the confidentiality of ongoing investigations.&nbsp; The disclosure test remains one of relevancy, and the legislative measures that restrict disclosure to protect the privacy interests of individuals implicated in criminal matters continue to apply (see, for example, <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec278.1" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec278.1" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Quesnelle</i>, 2014 SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390). &nbsp;Moreover, the Crown exercises discretion with respect to the manner and timing of disclosure, thus allowing the Crown to delay disclosure to ensure the safety of individuals involved in an ongoing investigation (<i>Stinchcombe</i>, at pp. 339-40).&nbsp; This discretionary decision, like all other exercises of Crown discretion in disclosure matters, must be justified on review (<i>Stinchcombe</i>, at p. 340).</p>
 <p class="Title2LevelTitre2Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">F.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Summary of Analysis</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarize, any elevated risks of prejudice that arise when an accused seeks to introduce evidence of an unknown third party suspect do not require the accused to satisfy a higher admissibility threshold or require the judge to engage in an enhanced evaluation of the evidence.&nbsp; Existing rules achieve the appropriate balance of maintaining the integrity of the trial process while protecting the right of an accused to make full answer and defence to the charges against her.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, defence evidence is admissible where<i> </i>(1) the evidence is relevant to a fact in issue; and (2) the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects.&nbsp; Where the connection between the evidence and a fact in issue at trial is not obvious, the air of reality test may help a trial judge in determining if the evidence tends to prove a defence that may become available.&nbsp; Relevant evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect will only be excluded where its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its probative value.</p>
 <p class="Title2LevelTitre2Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">G.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Application to the Facts</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in law in treating the evidence relating to the P.W. incident as known third party suspect evidence.&nbsp; The connections tying a known third party to the charged crime ‚Äï generally motive, opportunity or propensity ‚Äï do not fit the context of an unknown third party suspect.&nbsp; He also erred in requiring the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that the alleged abduction took place.&nbsp; There is no such evidentiary burden on the accused where he seeks to rely on the defence that an unknown third party committed the crime in question.&nbsp; To the extent that the trial judge made findings of probative value and prejudicial effects, those findings are intimately tied to the incorrect balancing tests he used, and thus cannot be relied upon.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These errors entitled the Court of Appeal to conduct its own assessment of the evidence (<i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 31-35).&nbsp; The court considered P.W.‚Äôs <i>viva voce </i>testimony and her prior statements to the police, which the trial judge had accepted (for the purposes of the <i>voir dire</i>) for the truth of their contents, in accordance with <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787. &nbsp;The court also considered other statements that had been admitted on the <i>voir dire</i> for the truth of their contents with the Crown‚Äôs consent, and other evidence pertaining to the incident, including the police reports noting a possible connection between the P.W. incident and the Derksen murder.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[57]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal concluded that the evidence was ‚Äúvery relevant‚Äù and that its probative value arose from the marked similarities between the alleged abduction of P.W. and the crime for which Mr. Grant is charged.&nbsp; In each case, the victim was of a similar age.&nbsp; Both victims left school at the same time of day, on the same day of the week, nine months apart.&nbsp; Both were left in unlocked shed-like premises in the same industrial area of Winnipeg, 2.6 kilometres apart.&nbsp; Both victims were found abandoned with their hands and feet tied with similar knots.&nbsp; In neither case was there evidence of physical or sexual assault.&nbsp; The same type of gum wrapper was found at both scenes (although, in the crime charged, it was found in the deceased‚Äôs pocket, suggesting it may have been hers).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot accept the Crown‚Äôs submission that these similarities are insufficient on any test and that the evidence relied upon by the Court of Appeal would not be available at trial.&nbsp; As the Crown cannot resile from its concession that the various statements were admissible for their truth for the purpose of determining admissibility, the Court of Appeal was entitled to rely upon this <i>voir dire</i> evidence in assessing its potential probative value.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal was entitled to conclude that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the subsequent crime had occurred and, having regard to the similarities, that it had been committed by the same person who killed Candace Derksen.&nbsp; In light of the evidence that the accused could not have committed the other offence, there was some evidence capable of giving the unknown third party suspect defence an air of reality.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal applied <i>Seaboyer </i>as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">It is left to be decided whether this relevant evidence should be excluded because its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value. In this case, the only prejudicial effect would be the impact this evidence would have had on the trial process in what was an already complicated and lengthy trial.&nbsp; From his reasons, the judge was obviously concerned about this impact.&nbsp; In my view, that concern did not substantially outweigh the probative value.&nbsp; [para. 78]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Seaboyer </i>requires the court to measure and weigh the extent of probative value and the extent of the prejudicial effect of the evidence.&nbsp; Obviously, this balancing is highly fact driven and best done by the trial judge.&nbsp; The prejudicial effects of this evidence primarily concern the impact on the complexity, focus, and length of the trial process.&nbsp; To some extent, the trial judge can craft a process that will limit these prejudicial effects.&nbsp; However, the trial judge did not address this issue in any detail.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While an appellate court is entitled to step into the shoes of the trial judge if the record permits, in this case, the Court of Appeal was not in the position to assess and weigh the extent of the probative value of the unknown third party suspect evidence and the extent of prejudicial effect of this evidence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge‚Äôs legal errors were clearly not minor, and do not attract the application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the trial judge applied the correct principles in determining the test for the admissibility of this defence evidence (<i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988]<i> </i>2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374).&nbsp; This case must be re-tried in any event.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the balancing of the <i>Seaboyer</i> factors is best left for the trial judge.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this Court, Mr. Grant also submitted a motion to adduce fresh evidence relating to DNA analysis and juror bias.&nbsp; Because of my finding with respect to the admission of evidence relating to an unknown third party suspect, it is not necessary to deal with that motion.</p>
