In that e‑mail, he apologized to A a second time.&nbsp; At trial, the accused’s May&nbsp;27 confession to the police was ruled inadmissible, on the basis that the police officer had offered an inducement by implying that the accused would not be charged if he apologized.&nbsp; A and her mother testified for the Crown.&nbsp; The mother gave evidence about the July&nbsp;5 e‑mail and, when asked by the trial judge, defence counsel said that he did not object to the e‑mail being admitted in evidence.&nbsp; No <i>voir dire</i> was conducted.&nbsp; The accused testified in his defence, denying that he had sexually assaulted A and indicating that the apology in the e‑mail was related to an incident when he had allowed A and some of her friends to share alcoholic “coolers”.&nbsp; Credibility was the main issue at trial and the contents of the e‑mail played a crucial role in the trial judge’s decision.&nbsp; He disbelieved the accused’s explanation and convicted him.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial, concluding that the trial judge had erred by failing to conduct a <i>voir dire</i>, on his own motion, to determine the admissibility of the e‑mail.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
200%"><span lang="EN-GB">The “derived confessions rule” serves to exclude statements which, despite not appearing to be involuntary when considered alone, are sufficiently connected to an earlier involuntary confession as to be rendered involuntary and hence inadmissible.&nbsp; It is not necessary, nor would it be appropriate on this record, to decide whether the derived confessions rule extends to admissions made to ordinary persons.&nbsp; It suffices to assume that, given an appropriate evidentiary basis connecting the police inducement and the later e‑mail, it would at least be arguable that the subsequent statement could be excluded, if not on the basis of the common law derived confessions rule, perhaps on a <i>Charter</i> basis.&nbsp; The defence, however, neither raised the argument concerning the derived confessions rule at trial nor brought a <i>Charter</i> application seeking the exclusion of the e‑mail.&nbsp; In deciding whether there was clear evidence which ought to have triggered the need for the trial judge to raise the issue on his own motion, an appellate court must consider the question from the perspective of the trial judge at the time the decision was made.&nbsp; Here, the most significant circumstance is that defence counsel consented to the admission of the e‑mail.&nbsp; In an adversarial system of criminal trials, trial judges must, barring exceptional circumstances, defer to the tactical decisions of counsel, and there was no basis, in this case, to conclude that the trial judge ought to have interfered with the decision of counsel.&nbsp; On the facts, it is difficult to find evidence of a connection between the two statements which should have alerted the trial judge to the need to conduct a <i>voir dire</i> and to question the wisdom of counsel.&nbsp; The initial apology was made on May&nbsp;27, 2004, while the e‑mail was sent over five weeks later on July&nbsp;5.&nbsp; The inducement held out by the police, as found by the trial judge on the <i>voir dire</i>, was the suggestion that the accused might not be charged if he apologized.&nbsp; However, by the time the accused sent the e‑mail, he had been charged notwithstanding his apology in the police statement.&nbsp; It is therefore far from obvious on what basis the inducement could still have been operative in the accused’s mind.&nbsp; Additionally, the two statements were made to different persons in entirely different circumstances.&nbsp; Finally, as the accused’s later testimony in the trial revealed, it was his contention that the apology in the e‑mail concerned a completely unrelated incident.&nbsp; Given that the accused’s own version was contrary to any theory of a potential connection between the e‑mail and the earlier confession, it is difficult to see on what basis counsel’s consent to the admissibility of the e‑mail could be faulted.</span></p>

200%"><i>Per</i> Binnie and Fish JJ. (dissenting): The Court of Appeal’s judgment should be affirmed.&nbsp; The trial judge had in the record before him a clear indication that the accused’s second “apology” might be a “derived confession”and was legally bound to himself determine its admissibility.&nbsp; His failure to make any independent determination as to the admissibility of the impugned statement is necessarily fatal to the accused’s conviction because, according to the trial judge himself, the impugned statement was critical to his conclusion that the accused was guilty as charged.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
200%">The derived confessions rule excludes statements that, while not inadmissible when considered in isolation, are excluded because of their temporal or causal connection to another statement found by the court to be inadmissible.&nbsp; The question is whether the tainting features that disqualified the first confession continue to be present or the fact that the first statement was made was a substantial factor contributing to the making of the second statement.&nbsp; Where the evidence raises a concern in this regard, the sufficiency of the required connection must be determined by the trial judge on a <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; An objection by counsel is not required to trigger the judge’s obligation to conduct the <i>voir dire</i>.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
200%">In this case, there was ample evidence on the record to alert the trial judge to the need for a <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; During his interrogation, the accused was repeatedly and emphatically urged to apologize to A, and was told that her complaints were “not a big deal” and were “extremely minor”.&nbsp; One officer told the accused an entirely fictional story according to which the officer had himself been arrested for slapping his son, but the matter was resolved once the officer apologized.&nbsp; The officer said the Crown would decide whether to proceed with the charges or simply look at counselling instead, and that the most important thing they looked at was an apology.&nbsp; The accused was told that if he simply apologized the matter might not proceed, and the officer promised to stick with the accused throughout the matter.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
200%">The judge had already excluded the initial statement or “apology” written by the accused during the police interrogation, and was thus familiar with the inducements that had provoked it.&nbsp; The e-mail was strikingly similar to the excluded statement.&nbsp; Moreover, whether the Crown would proceed with the charges remained a live issue when it was sent.&nbsp; The improper inducements present when the inadmissible statement was given to the police —&nbsp; notably, the promise of leniency in exchange for a showing of remorse in the form of an apology —&nbsp; were still operative.&nbsp; In these circumstances, cumulatively considered, the connection between the two statements was apparent from the record and should have alerted the trial judge to the need for a <i>voir dire</i>.</p>

<div class="Section8">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
200%">The Crown contends that the “person in authority” requirement for exclusion under the confessions rule applies to derived confessions as well.&nbsp; This Court has previously excluded a statement as a derived confession without determining whether it was made to a person in authority, so it cannot be said that a derived confession will only be excluded if it is made to a person in authority.&nbsp; The purpose of the derived confessions rule — to exclude statements that are tainted by their connection to a prior inadmissible statement — would be frustrated if they were excluded only when made to a person in authority.&nbsp; If the statement is prompted by the same police conduct that resulted in exclusion of the earlier confession, or if it discloses the contents of the earlier statement made to authorities, it is a product of the inadmissible confession and is itself inadmissible on that ground alone.</p>

Under the rules of evidence, statements made by an accused are admissions by an opposing party and, as such, fall into an exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; They are admissible for the truth of their contents.&nbsp; When statements are made by an accused to ordinary persons, such as friends or family members, they are presumptively admissible without the necessity of a <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; It is only where the accused makes a statement to a “person in authority”, that the Crown bears the onus of proving the voluntariness of the statement as a prerequisite to its admission.&nbsp; This, of course, is the confessions rule.</p>

Further, S.G.T. did not raise the issue at trial.&nbsp; While A’s mother may, as a parent of a minor complainant in a criminal trial, be a person in authority, her status alone is not sufficient to render her a person in authority:&nbsp; see <i>R. v. A.B.</i> (1986), 50 C.R. (3d) 247 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 257-59; <i>Hodgson</i>, at para. 36.&nbsp; In those cases where parents have been held to be persons in authority, there has generally been some type of interaction between the parents and the police.&nbsp; For example, in <i>R. v. Trenholme </i>(1920), 30 B.R. 232, the victim’s father was held to be person in authority on the basis that he actually “laid the charge” and “had authority and control over the prosecution against the accused” (pp. 249 and 243).&nbsp; More recently, in <i>R. v. Wells</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 517, this Court held that a <i>voir dire</i> was required into whether a parent was a person in authority where the parent had previously spoken to the police about his intention to trick the accused into making a statement.&nbsp; It was on that basis that <i>Wells</i> was one of those “rare cases” where a <i>voir dire</i> was required for an individual who was not a clear person in authority (para. 16).&nbsp; By contrast, in <i>Hodgson</i>, the mere fact that the parents of a young girl confronted the accused about sexually assaulting their daughter did not serve to turn them into persons in authority.&nbsp; The Court emphasized in <i>Hodgson</i> that only rarely will the need for a <i>voir dire</i> be triggered in such circumstances.&nbsp; Moreover, what needs to be shown before the trial judge will be required to hold a <i>voir dire</i> on his or her own motion bears repeating here:</p>

Moreover, the dissent in <i>G. (B.)</i>,&nbsp; written by McLachlin J.

It suffices for our purposes to assume that, given an appropriate evidentiary basis connecting the police inducement and the later e-mail, it would at least be arguable that the subsequent statement could be excluded, if not on the basis of the common law derived confessions rule, perhaps on a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> basis.&nbsp; The distinction between the two possible bases for exclusion remains important as the application of the common law “derived confessions rule” would result in the automatic exclusion of the tainted statement, whereas under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> the question of exclusion would fall to be determined under s. 24(2).&nbsp; However, the defence did not raise the argument concerning the derived confessions rule at trial, nor did S.G.T. bring a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> application seeking the exclusion of the e-mail.&nbsp; For example, it would have been an opportune time to raise the argument during the course of the <i>voir dire</i> into the admissibility of the police confession if the defence contended that there was some connection between the police confession and the e-mail.&nbsp; Again, no issue was raised when the trial judge specifically asked whether the defence contested the admissibility of the e-mail at the time the evidence was presented.&nbsp; Quite to the contrary, in answer to the trial judge’s inquiry, the defence expressly <i>consented</i> to its admission.</p>

Lomage</i> (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 621 (C.A.), at pp. 629-30.&nbsp; There is a “strong presumption” that defence counsel are competent in advancing the interests of their clients:&nbsp; see <i>R. v. G.D.B.</i>, 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 27; <i>Hodgson</i>, at para. 99.&nbsp; Moreover, counsel will generally be in a better position to assess the wisdom, in light of their overall trial strategy, of a particular tactical decision than is the trial judge.&nbsp; By contrast, trial judges are expected to be impartial arbiters of the dispute before them; the more a trial judge second-guesses or overrides the decisions of counsel, the greater is the risk that the trial judge will, in either appearance or reality, cease being a neutral arbiter and instead become an advocate for one party.&nbsp; For these reasons, this Court has previously held that the burden to raise evidentiary issues properly rests on the shoulders of counsel:&nbsp; <i>Hodgson</i>, at para. 98.</p>

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, 2002 SCC 61, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 209, at para. 68.&nbsp; However, reviewing the record from the perspective of the trial judge and taking into account the factors from <i>I.

However, by the time S.G.T. sent the e-mail, he had been charged notwithstanding his apology in the police statement.&nbsp; It is therefore far from obvious on what basis the inducement could still be operative in the accused’s mind.&nbsp; Additionally, there was no advertence to the previous inadmissible statement in the e-mail to A’s mother.&nbsp; Finally, the two statements were made to different persons in entirely different circumstances.&nbsp; The first statement was made to a police officer in the context of a custodial interrogation, while the second was made to A’s mother in an e-mail exchange relating to A’s mother’s attempt to secure S.G.T.’s permission to allow A and B to travel to California with her.&nbsp; But, more importantly, as the accused’s later testimony in the trial revealed, it was his contention that the apology in the e-mail concerned a completely <i>unrelated</i> incident.&nbsp; This exemplifies why trial judges should generally defer to the tactical decisions of counsel who generally know more about the case.&nbsp; Given that the accused’s own version was contrary to any theory of a potential connection between the e-mail and the earlier confession, it is difficult to see on what basis counsel’s consent to the admissibility of the e-mail could be faulted.</p>

By this I do not mean that there must be a <i>voir dire</i> on the voluntariness of the protected statement in every case; once again, this is a question that will have to be determined in another case.
