 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The law presumes that people act voluntarily.&nbsp; Since a defence of automatism amounts to a claim that one‚Äôs actions were not voluntary, the accused must establish a proper foundation for this defence before it can be left with the trier of fact.&nbsp; This is the equivalent of satisfying the evidentiary burden for automatism.&nbsp; Once the evidentiary foundation has been established, the trial judge must determine whether the condition alleged by the accused is mental disorder or non-mental disorder automatism.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A two-step approach should therefore apply to all cases involving claims of automatism.&nbsp; First, the defence must establish a proper foundation for automatism.&nbsp; This burden is only met where the trial judge concludes that there is evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find that the accused acted involuntarily on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; In all cases, this will require that the defence make an assertion of involuntariness and call confirming psychiatric evidence.&nbsp; Other relevant factors to be considered in determining whether this defence burden has been satisfied include:&nbsp; the severity of the triggering stimulus; corroborating evidence of bystanders; corroborating medical history of automatistic-like dissociative states; whether there is evidence of a motive for the crime; and whether the alleged trigger of the automatism is also the victim of the automatistic violence.&nbsp; No one factor is determinative.&nbsp; The trial judge must weigh all of the available evidence on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; Placing this burden on the defence, while constituting a limitation of an accused‚Äôs s. 11(<i>d</i>) <i>Charter</i> rights, is justified under s. 1.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Second, given the establishment of a proper foundation, the trial judge must determine whether the condition alleged by the accused is mental disorder or non-mental disorder automatism.&nbsp; The assessment of which form of automatism should be left with the trier of fact comes down to the question of whether or not the alleged condition is a mental disorder.&nbsp; Mental disorder is a legal term defined in the <i>Code</i> as ‚Äúa disease of the mind‚Äù.&nbsp; The question of what conditions are included in that term is a question of mixed law and fact because it involves an assessment of the particular evidence in the case rather than a general principle of law.&nbsp; Trial judges should start from the proposition that the condition is a disease of the mind and then determine whether the evidence in the particular case takes the condition out of the disease of the mind category.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">There are two distinct approaches to the disease of the mind inquiry.&nbsp; Under the first, the internal cause theory, the trial judge must compare the accused‚Äôs automatistic reaction to the way one would expect a normal person to react in order to determine whether the condition the accused claims to have suffered from is a disease of the mind.&nbsp; The trial judge must consider the nature of the alleged trigger of the automatism and determine whether a normal person might have reacted to it by entering an automatistic state.&nbsp; This comparison is a contextual objective one.&nbsp; Evidence of an extremely shocking trigger will be required to establish that a normal person might have reacted to it by entering an automatistic state as the accused claims to have done.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The objective element of the internal cause theory does not violate ss.&nbsp;7 (the fundamental principles of justice) and 11(<i>d</i>) (the right to be presumed innocent) of the <i>Charter</i>.&nbsp; The objective inquiry is applied to assess whether the condition claimed by the accused is a disease of the mind only after a subjective inquiry has been completed by the trial judge into whether there is evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find, on a balance of probabilities, that the accused acted involuntarily.&nbsp; The objective standard affects only the classification of the defence rather than the assessment of whether the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence has been established.&nbsp; That is, the objective component does not affect the burden of proof on the issue of whether the accused voluntarily committed the offence.&nbsp; Moreover, the impact of the objective comparison is limited even with regard to the disease of the mind inquiry because the internal cause theory is only an analytical tool.&nbsp; Consideration of the subjective psychological make-up of the accused in the internal cause theory would frustrate the very purpose of making the comparison which is the determination of whether the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind in a legal sense.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The second approach, the continuing danger theory, holds that any condition which is likely to present a recurring danger to the public should be treated as a disease of the mind.&nbsp; While a continuing danger suggests a disease of the mind, a finding of no continuing danger does not preclude a finding of a disease of the mind.&nbsp; Trial judges may consider any of the evidence before them in order to assess the likelihood of recurrence of violence and in particular the psychiatric history of the accused and the likelihood that the trigger alleged to have caused the automatistic episode will recur.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:

While the appellant maintained in his evidence-in-chief that he did not remember picking up the knife or taking it from its sheath, he did admit in cross-examination, when confronted with prior statements attributed to him in the psychiatrist‚Äôs report, to a vague recollection through the dream of stabbing his wife twice in the chest before the ‚Äúwhooshing‚Äù sensation.&nbsp; His psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Janke, testified that the appellant had told him that, while in Mexico, he ‚Äúbecame aware of a memory of having a knife in his hand and stabbing Donna Stone twice in the chest <u>before</u> having the ‚Äòwhooshing‚Äô sensation . . . whenever we talked about the stabbing, it would be in the context of stabbing twice and, and then having the whooshing experience‚Äù (emphasis added).&nbsp; One of Dr. Janke‚Äôs tasks was to separate out the effects of amnesia after the event from the alleged unconsciousness during the events themselves, for as noted by Lord Denning in <i>Bratty v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Voluntary action presupposes a measure of conscious control.&nbsp; Dickson J. in <i>Rabey</i> allowed, at p. 522, that, ‚Äú[a]t common law, a person who engaged in what would otherwise have been criminal conduct was not guilty of a crime if he did so in a state of unconsciousness or <u>semi-consciousness</u>‚Äù (emphasis added).&nbsp; In context, however, the reference to ‚Äúsemi-consciousness‚Äù was to a state of diminished awareness that <u>negated</u> control.&nbsp; I think Crown counsel‚Äôs submissions in oral argument were consistent with this approach.&nbsp; He submitted that automatism describes ‚Äúinvoluntary behaviour that occurs without the minimum mental element necessary to <u>will</u> the act‚Äù, and ‚Äú[i]t is the state of a person who, though capable of action, is <u>incapable</u> of knowing that the act is taking place‚Äù (emphasis added).&nbsp; His definitions encompassed the notions of awareness <u>and</u> control.&nbsp; I agree with the Crown‚Äôs submissions in this regard.&nbsp; Dr. Janke, the defence psychiatrist, used ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù in the sense of awareness or control, as is clear from the following extracts from his evidence:</p>

Cameron</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 272 (Ont. C.A.), on the grounds that provocation did not arise for consideration until <u>after</u> the Crown had successfully established all of the ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù elements of unlawful homicide beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The provocation defence did not relieve the Crown of any element of its proof.&nbsp; Provocation simply operates, where applicable, to reduce murder to manslaughter.&nbsp; Thus, while evidence relating to the events preceding the commission of an offence may raise questions about both automatism and provocation, very different proof of facts must be made before either one of these issues can be left with the jury.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The price of the ‚Äúlimited exception to‚Äù the <i>Leary</i> rule was that the accused, who experienced the steps by which he got himself drunk, was required to show, on a balance of probability, that the drunkenness induced an absence of awareness that was akin to a state of insanity or automatism.&nbsp; At p. 101, Cory J. explained:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The Court thus concluded that a s. 1 justification had been established.&nbsp; Drunkenness is a matter of degree.&nbsp; It is a reasonably common phenomenon in its lesser manifestations.&nbsp; In its extreme form it may produce a potential defence <u>akin</u> to automatism to which special rules apply.&nbsp; <i>Daviault</i> did not suggest a reversal of the persuasive burden whenever the state of mind of an accused is successfully put in issue, in provocation for example (s. 232, <i>Linney v. The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 646, <i>R. v. Thibert</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37), or self-defence (s. 34, <i>R. v. Lavallee</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, <i>R. v. Malott</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 123), or an accused‚Äôs belief as to consent to an assault (s. 265(4),&nbsp; <i>Latour v. The King</i>, [1951] S.C.R. 19, <i>R. v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 682-83); in all such cases (and many others) the Crown carries the persuasive burden to negate a state of mind asserted by the accused, despite the fact that an accused is often in a better position than the Crown to shed light on his or her state of mind at the time of the alleged crime.&nbsp; The accused may be in a better position to shed light on most elements of the offence.&nbsp; The Crown did not ask for a reverse onus where non-insane automatism is in issue and therefore did not put forward a case for the application of s. 1.&nbsp; I do not believe the Court ought to embark on organizing its own s. 1 justification where none of the Attorneys General saw fit even to propose the shift of the persuasive onus much less to try to justify it.</p>

(2d) 1).&nbsp; Martin J.A. comprehensively reviewed the precedents and concluded, at p. 22, that the student had merely suffered one of ‚Äúthe ordinary stresses and disappointments of life which are the common lot of mankind‚Äù and was not entitled to the benefit of non-mental disorder automatism.&nbsp; Martin J.A. considered that the so-called ‚Äúblow‚Äù would not have caused an ordinary person to black out.&nbsp; If it blacked out the accused, he must have been suffering from some mental frailty which the law would regard as a disease of the mind.&nbsp; In the absence of a disease of the mind, Martin J.A. seemed to feel, the evidence of a ‚Äúblackout‚Äù from such a minor rebuff was simply not credible.&nbsp; Martin J.A. was clearly perturbed that the jury had acquitted on such evidence.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial at which the accused would be allowed to run only an insanity defence.&nbsp; The decision and the reasoning of Martin J.A. were adopted by a majority of this Court.</p>

Grant, D. Chunn and C. Boyle, <i>The Law of Homicide</i> (loose-leaf), at p. 6-118).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">The continuing danger theory holds that any condition likely to present a recurring danger to the public should be treated as insanity.&nbsp; The internal cause theory suggests that a condition stemming from the psychological or emotional make-up of the accused, rather than some external factor, should lead to a finding of insanity.&nbsp; The two theories share a common concern for recurrence, the latter holding that an internal weakness is more likely to lead to recurrent violence than automatism brought on by some intervening external cause.</p>

Hennessy</i> (1989), 89 Cr. App. R. 10 (C.A.) it was held that the involuntary conduct of a diabetic who <u>failed</u> to take his insulin was internally caused (by his diabetes) and must thus be considered an expression of insanity.&nbsp; The differing treatment of diabetes, based on factors which have nothing to do with the underlying nature of the condition, demonstrates the potential artificiality of the analysis, and thus its limitations.&nbsp;</p>

Nevertheless, it has become the practice to regard a person as ‚Äúincapable of understanding the nature and quality‚Äù of his act when in truth he was not conscious of having acted at all; and to treat the formula as applicable to cases of automatism. . . .&nbsp; It is unfortunate that there should have been this too liberal application of the M‚ÄôNaghten Rules.

Holland points out that this reference to unconsciousness reveals that the law assumes that a person is necessarily either conscious or unconscious.&nbsp; However, the medical literature speaks of different levels of consciousness (p. 96).&nbsp; Indeed, the expert evidence in the present case reveals that medically speaking, ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù means ‚Äúflat on the floor‚Äù, that is, in a comatose-type state.&nbsp; I therefore prefer to define automatism as a state of impaired consciousness, rather than unconsciousness, in which an individual, though capable of action, has no voluntary control over that action.</p>

24.4pt">Although the word ‚Äúautomatism‚Äù made its way but lately to the legal stage, it is basic principle that absence of volition in respect of the act involved is always a defence to a crime.&nbsp; A defence that the act is involuntary entitles the accused to a complete and unqualified acquittal.&nbsp; That the defence of automatism exists as a middle ground between criminal responsibility and legal insanity is beyond question.</p>

Cameron</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 272, where the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the objective standard involved in the defence of provocation does not violate ss. 7 and 11(<i>d</i>) because it does not detract from the <i>mens rea</i> required to establish murder.&nbsp; The point I wish to make here is that the objective component of the internal cause theory does not affect the burden of proof on the issue of whether the accused voluntarily committed the offence.&nbsp; Moreover, the impact of the objective comparison is limited even with regard to the disease of the mind inquiry.&nbsp; As noted above, I agree with La&nbsp;Forest J. in <i>Parks</i> that the internal cause theory is only an analytical tool.&nbsp; It is not being held out as the definitive answer to the disease of the mind question.&nbsp; In each case, the trial judge must determine whether and to what extent the theory is useful given the facts of the case.&nbsp; Indeed, he or she has the discretion to disregard the theory if its application would not accord with the policy concerns which underlie the disease of the mind inquiry.&nbsp; In this way, the internal cause approach attempts to strike an appropriate balance between the objectives of providing an exemption from criminal liability for morally innocent offenders and protecting the public.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the objective component of the internal cause theory does not limit either <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> or <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s. 11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">d<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; I would add that consideration of the subjective psychological make-up of the accused in the internal cause theory would frustrate the very purpose of making the comparison, which is of course to determine whether the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind in a legal sense.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society‚Äôs condemnation of that particular offender‚Äôs <u>conduct</u>.&nbsp; In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender‚Äôs conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society‚Äôs basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law.&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Our criminal law is also a system of values. A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated.&nbsp; In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This Court‚Äôs jurisprudence also indicates that the law must evolve to reflect changing social values regarding the status between men and women; see <i>Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219;<i> R. v. Lavallee</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852; <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577.</p>

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 872, this Court recognized the ‚Äúhistorical trend of violence perpetrated by men against women‚Äù (p. 877).&nbsp; More specifically, in <i>Lavallee</i>,<i> supra</i>,<b> </b>at p. 872, the growing social awareness of the problem of domestic violence was recognized by this Court.&nbsp; In my opinion, these cases indicate that prevailing social values mandate that the moral responsibility of offenders be assessed in the context of equality between men and women in general, and spouses in particular.&nbsp; Clearly, spousal killings involve the breach of a socially recognized and valued trust and must be recognized as a serious aggravating factor under s. 718.2(<i>a</i>)(ii).</p>

Doyle</i> (1991), 108 N.S.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Brown</i> (1992), 13 C.R. (4th) 346 (Alta. C.A.); <i>R. v. Pitkeathly</i> (1994), 29 C.R. (4th) 182 (Ont. C.A.);<i> R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
