 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused was charged with sexually assaulting a woman he had dated and lived with. The two remained friends and the complainant would occasionally come to the accused‚Äôs house and stay overnight. At trial, the accused requested a <i>voir dire</i> to determine if evidence that he and the complainant were in a sexual relationship ‚Äî ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù ‚Äî at the time of the alleged assault was admissible under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec276" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;276<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. He argued that the sexual nature of the relationship provided important context without which the jury would be left with the artificial impression that he and the complainant had a platonic relationship. The accused also advanced that he did not intend to rely on this evidence to support the twin‚Äëmyth inferences that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity or was less worthy of belief. The trial judge admitted the evidence, concluding that keeping this ‚Äúrelatively benign‚Äù evidence from the jury would lend an element of artificiality to the proceedings and harm the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence. At trial, both sides led evidence regarding the frequency of the sexual contact between the complainant and the accused. The jury found the accused not guilty. A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown‚Äôs appeal and ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge had erred in admitting the evidence. In its view, the only inferences to be drawn from the evidence were those relying on the twin myths and limiting instructions could not cure the fact that the jury had heard inadmissible evidence for which there was no permissible use.

A new trial is required.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Canadian justice system strives to protect the ability of triers of fact to get at the truth. In cases of sexual assault, evidence of a complainant‚Äôs prior sexual history ‚Äî if relied upon to suggest that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity in question or is generally less worthy of belief ‚Äî undermines this truth‚Äëseeking function and threatens the equality, privacy and security rights of complainants. Section 276 was enacted to mitigate these harms, balancing a number of trial fairness considerations and seeking to exclude evidence known to distort the fact‚Äëfinding process. It protects the integrity of the trial process by safeguarding both the dignity and privacy of complainants and the right of accused persons to make full answer and defence. It is designed to exclude irrelevant information that is more prejudicial to the administration of justice than it is probative.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 276(1) and (2) operate together to achieve these objectives. Section 276(1) sets out an absolute bar against introducing evidence of the complainant‚Äôs prior sexual activity for the purpose of drawing twin‚Äëmyth inferences. When an accused seeks to introduce such evidence for some other purpose, that evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless the accused satisfies s.&nbsp;276(2). To do so, the accused must demonstrate that the evidence is of specific instances of sexual activity, is relevant to an issue at trial, and has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice. The accused must identify the evidence and its purpose with sufficient precision to allow the judge to apply s.&nbsp;276(2) and weigh the factors set out in s.&nbsp;276(3), which include the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence, the need to remove discriminatory beliefs or biases from the fact‚Äëfinding process, the potential prejudice to the complainant‚Äôs dignity and privacy, and the right of every individual to the full protection and benefit of the law.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of a relationship that implies sexual activity clearly engages s.&nbsp;276(1), and, to be admissible, must satisfy the requirements of s.&nbsp;276(2). The risk that evidence of a relationship which implies sexual activity may be used to support twin‚Äëmyth reasoning is clear. Even relatively benign relationship evidence must be scrutinized and handled with care. If the accused cannot point to a relevant use of the evidence other than the twin myths, mere assurances that the evidence will not be used for those purposes are insufficient.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the evidence was barred by s.&nbsp;276(1) because it served no purpose other than to support the inference that because the complainant had consented in the past, she was more likely to have consented on the night in question. Nor did the evidence satisfy the conditions of admissibility under s.&nbsp;276(2).</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the first condition, the accused successfully demonstrated that the evidence was of specific instances of sexual activity. The words ‚Äúspecific instances of sexual activity‚Äù in s.&nbsp;276(2)(a) must be read in light of the scheme and broader purpose of s. 276. Evidence of a relationship that implies sexual activity inherently encompasses specific instances of sexual activity. To satisfy s.&nbsp;276(2)(a), the accused must point to identifiable activity, but the degree of specificity required in a particular case will depend on the nature of the evidence, how the accused intends to use it, and its potential to prejudice the administration of justice. Here, the accused specified the parties to the relationship, the nature of that relationship and the relevant time period. Requiring further details would have unnecessarily invaded the complainant‚Äôs privacy.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the accused failed to fulfill the second condition by establishing that the evidence was relevant to an issue at trial as required by s.&nbsp;276(2)(b). The accused must identify, with precision, how the evidence is relevant to a specific issue at trial. The relevant issue cannot be one of the twin myths prohibited by s.&nbsp;276(1), and generic references to credibility of the accused or the complainant, narrative or context will not suffice. While the case law provides examples of how evidence of previous sexual activity between an accused and a complainant may be relevant to an issue at trial, none of them apply in this case. There are circumstances in which evidence of a sexual relationship may be fundamental to the coherence of an accused‚Äôs narrative, and by extension, credibility, but here there was nothing about the accused‚Äôs testimony that cast him in an unfavourable light or rendered his narrative untenable absent the information that he and the complainant were friends with benefits.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the third condition ‚Äî which requires balancing a number of factors to determine whether the evidence has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice ‚Äî the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence would not have been compromised by excluding the sexual nature of his relationship with the complainant. Indeed, the evidence was not relevant to an issue at trial and therefore had no probative value.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admitting the evidence was a reversible error of law which might reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on the acquittal and a new trial is therefore required. The improper admission of the evidence as ‚Äúcontext‚Äù risked infecting the trial with the precise prejudicial assumptions s.&nbsp;276 was designed to weed out. The jury should not have been privy to particulars regarding the frequency of the sexual contact or the accused‚Äôs testimony characterizing the evening as ‚Äútypical‚Äù or ‚Äúroutine‚Äù. That evidence clearly engaged twin‚Äëmyth reasoning by suggesting that because the complainant had ‚Äútypically‚Äù consented to sex with the accused in the past, she was more likely to have done so on that ‚Äúroutine‚Äù occasion.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><span style="line-height:200%">Per</span></i><span style="line-height:200%"> Moldaver and Rowe JJ.: The trial judge erred in admitting the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec276" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;276<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, having </span><span style="line-height:200%">particular regard to the manifest deficiencies in the accused‚Äôs application to introduce this evidence</span><span style="line-height:200%">. The improper admission of the evidence for the broad purpose of providing ‚Äúcontext‚Äù led to a significant and highly prejudicial broadening of the sexual activity evidence at trial, which might reasonably have had a material bearing on the accused‚Äôs acquittal. Accordingly, a new trial is warranted, and the appeal should be dismissed.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">The s.&nbsp;276 regime is designed to respect and preserve the rights of both<i> </i>complainants and accused persons by excluding evidence which would undermine the legitimacy of our criminal justice system and inhibit the search for truth, while allowing for the admission of evidence which would enhance the legitimacy of our criminal justice system and promote the search for truth. In this way, the regime seeks to promote the integrity of the trial process as a whole ‚Äî a concept that is essential to the public‚Äôs faith in the criminal justice system. </span><span style="line-height:
200%">In pursuing this objective, the s.&nbsp;276 regime operates in a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep manner. From the accused‚Äôs initial application under s.&nbsp;276.1 to the final limiting instruction required by s.&nbsp;276.4, the s.&nbsp;276 regime establishes a rigorous, multistep process through which sexual activity evidence adduced by or on behalf of the accused must be carefully vetted and winnowed down to its essentials. To make its way into evidence at trial, such evidence must withstand careful scrutiny at each stage of the process.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 276(1) prohibits the use of sexual activity evidence to support one of the twin myths identified in <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577. In doing so, it gives effect to the principle that these myths are simply not relevant at trial and can severely distort the trial process. Accordingly, if the sole purpose for which sexual activity evidence is being proffered is to support either of the twin myths, it will be ruled inadmissible under s.&nbsp;276(1).</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that does not mean sexual activity evidence will always<i> </i>be ruled inadmissible. While sexual activity evidence adduced by or on behalf of the accused is presumptively inadmissible, such evidence may be admitted where it satisfies a three‚Äëpart test under s.&nbsp;276(2).</span><span style="line-height:200%"> B</span><span style="line-height:200%">efore sexual activity evidence can be admitted under this provision, the accused must file a written application under s.&nbsp;276.1. If the judge is not satisfied that certain requirements have been met (e.g., the application is deficient), then he or she may dismiss the application without more.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%"> </span><span style="line-height:200%">On the other hand, if the accused‚Äôs written application survives scrutiny, then the process moves to the <i>voir dire </i>stage and the court‚Äôs attention shifts to s.&nbsp;276(2).</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first requirement of s.&nbsp;276(2) is that the evidence be of specific instances of sexual activity. As stated in <i>R. v. L.S.</i>, 2017 ONCA 685</span>, 40 C.R. (7th) 351,<span style="line-height:200%"> the content of the ‚Äúspecific instances‚Äù requirement is linked to the nature of the evidence sought to be adduced. Where the accused seeks to introduce evidence of an individual instance of sexual activity, he must identify that instance with specificity. By contrast, where the accused seeks to introduce general evidence that describes the nature of the relationship between the accused and the complainant, the specificity requirement speaks to factors relevant to identifying the relationship and its nature and not to details of specific sexual encounters. These factors will include the parties to the relationship, the relevant time period, and the nature of the relationship.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second requirement of s.&nbsp;276(2) is that the evidence be ‚Äúrelevant to an issue at trial‚Äù. To satisfy this requirement, the accused must demonstrate that the evidence goes to a legitimate<i> </i>aspect of his defence and is integral to his ability to make full answer and defence. This requires that the accused be able to identify specific facts or issues relating to his defence that can be properly understood and resolved by the trier of fact only if reference is made to the sexual activity evidence in question. In articulating these specific facts or issues, simply citing the need to provide greater ‚Äúcontext‚Äù or a fuller ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù will not suffice. </span>Similarly, bare invocations of credibility will not be enough. <span style="line-height:
200%">Furthermore, the requirement that the evidence be ‚Äúintegral‚Äù to the accused‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence means that even if the evidence can be linked to specific facts or issues relating to the accused‚Äôs defence, admission is not guaranteed. There may be cases in which the evidence, while relevant to specific facts or issues relating to the accused‚Äôs defence, bears only marginally on it. In such cases, the trial judge may, in his or her discretion, exclude the evidence on the basis that countervailing considerations, such as the need to protect the privacy rights and dignity of the complainant, outweigh the tenuous connection the evidence has to the accused‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third requirement of s.&nbsp;276(2) is that the evidence have significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice. As explained in <i>R. v. Darrach</i>, 2000 SCC 46, </span>[2000] 2 S.C.R. 443,<span style="line-height:200%"> the requirement of significant probative value serves to exclude evidence of trifling relevance that, even though not used to support the two forbidden inferences, would still endanger the proper administration of justice.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:
200%">In undertaking the analysis required by s.&nbsp;276(2), which is designed to ensure that any admissible sexual activity evidence is limited in scope and that its legitimate purpose is identified and weighed against countervailing considerations, the trial judge must take into account the factors listed in s.&nbsp;276(3). </span><span style="line-height:200%">To the extent sexual activity evidence is ultimately admitted, the trial judge must explain to the jury, in clear and precise terms, the uses for which the evidence may ‚Äî and may not<i> </i>‚Äî be used. Finally, all trial participants ‚Äî including the trial judge, Crown and defence counsel, and witnesses ‚Äî must hew to the specific, legitimate purpose for which the evidence has been admitted, without expanding the scope of the ruling or using the admissible evidence for inadmissible purposes. This is essential to preserving not only the rights of the accused and the complainant, but also the integrity of the trial process as a whole.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence could, o</span><span style="line-height:200%">n its face, potentially be used to support the first of the twin myths ‚Äî the myth that because the complainant consented to have sex with the accused in the past, she was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity forming the subject‚Äëmatter of the sexual assault charge. However, s.&nbsp;276(1) takes this potential use off the table. As such, unless the accused could point to some legitimate<i> </i>use of the sexual activity evidence that would justify admission under s.&nbsp;276(2), that evidence was inadmissible.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the accused‚Äôs application under s.&nbsp;276.1 satisfied the specificity requirement under s.&nbsp;276(2)(a), it failed to satisfy the relevance requirement under s.&nbsp;276(2)(b). </span><span style="line-height:200%">The accused argued that the threshold for relevance was met because the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence: (1) was necessary to avoid an erroneous misapprehension on the part of the jury that he and the complainant were platonic friends at the time of the alleged sexual assault; and (2) provided ‚Äúcontext‚Äù to the issues at trial.</span><span style="line-height:200%"> However, the accused did not explain why it was necessary to correct any potential misapprehension as to the sexual nature of his relationship with the complainant.</span><span style="line-height:200%"> In addition, the accused failed to identify a specific, legitimate purpose for putting the evidence before the jury ‚Äî he did not link the evidence to specific facts or issues relating to his defence that could be properly understood and resolved only if reference could be made to the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence was also incapable of satisfying the third requirement </span><span style="line-height:200%">under s.&nbsp;276(2). </span><span style="line-height:200%">Because the evidence was not relevant to an issue at trial based on the application presented to the trial judge, it was necessarily incapable of possessing any probative value.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the possibility that the presiding judge at the new trial might, if presented with a properly framed s.&nbsp;276.1 application, admit the evidence after applying the test and weighing the factors in s.&nbsp;276(2) and (3) should not be foreclosed. </span><span style="line-height:200%">Without reaching any final decision on the matter, there was at least one specific issue that the accused could have referred to in his application that might have properly supported admission of the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence: </span><span style="line-height:200%">the jury‚Äôs assessment of his testimony that he mouthed the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you‚Äù to the complainant.</span><span style="line-height:200%"> If the jury lacked the knowledge that the two were in a sexual relationship at the time, that statement might have seemed bizarre or even menacing. Furthermore, the accused‚Äôs testimony that he made that statement to the complainant may itself have seemed implausible. In this way, withholding the sexual nature of the accused‚Äôs relationship with the complainant could have had an adverse impact on the jury‚Äôs assessment of his credibility, potentially infringing upon his right to make full answer and defence. Had the accused referenced this aspect of his anticipated testimony in his s.&nbsp;276.1 application, the trial judge would have been better equipped to engage in the balancing exercise required by s.&nbsp;276(2) and (3) and may have properly determined that the evidence was admissible for the narrow purpose of allowing the jury to assess the accused‚Äôs testimony on this point.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A new trial is required. A number of errors occurred at trial as a result of the trial judge‚Äôs improper s.&nbsp;276 ruling, which allowed for the admission of sexual activity evidence under the broad banner of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. Grounded in this ruling, the trial judge‚Äôs flawed limiting instructions failed to delineate how the sexual activity evidence was capable of assisting the jury to resolve specific facts or issues relating to the accused‚Äôs defence. This flawed instruction‚Äôs distorting effect was compounded when additional sexual activity evidence was admitted at trial which was not the subject of its own admissibility determination or limiting instruction. The cumulative impact of these errors can reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on the accused‚Äôs acquittal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> Brown<b> </b>J. (dissenting): The evidence was admissible. The trial judge applied the correct legal principles in her evidentiary ruling and the jury rendered its verdict after being properly instructed on how to do so. The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals restored.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence did not derive its relevance solely from twin‚Äëmyth reasoning and should therefore have filtered through s.&nbsp;276(1). The test for exclusion under s.&nbsp;276(1) is whether the evidence derives its relevance solely from twin‚Äëmyth reasoning and not whether it merely engages that type of reasoning. Were engagement the test for categorical exclusion under s.&nbsp;276(1), it would risk exclusion of all relationship evidence, or at the very least all evidence of relationships which also involve sexual activity, since that, too, would conceivably engage twin‚Äëmyth reasoning. Such an approach would resurrect the creation of pre‚Äëdetermined categories of admissibility which was rejected in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, and would downplay the text and purpose of statutory provisions like s.&nbsp;276.4, which recognizes that evidence may be admissible for certain purposes yet inadmissible for others, and makes a limiting instruction mandatory where any evidence of other sexual activity is introduced, even if it only refers to other sexual activity indirectly or implicitly, to cure prejudice and to warn the jury of the impermissible uses of that evidence. Rather, relationship evidence should typically be filtered via the inquiry contemplated by s.&nbsp;276(2)(b), being whether the evidence is relevant to an identifiable issue at trial.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the Crown failed to explain why evidence of the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship was objectionable, while evidence of other types of relationships which regularly pass through the filter of s.&nbsp;276(1), and yet which might also suggest previous sexual activity, is not. Evidence of relationships that involve sexual activity, but which lack the expectation or desire of a more formal relationship, may also give important context to the non‚Äësexual interactions between the parties to the relationship, which may be, as it was in this case, necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence. Evidence of a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship will, in certain cases, and without engaging in prohibited lines of reasoning, explain to a jury how two people know each other, consistent with how other relationships are presented to juries. The trial judge‚Äôs evidentiary ruling treated the relationship between the accused and the complainant consistently with other relationships in society.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence met the relevance test under s.&nbsp;276(2)(b) because it was relevant to the accused‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence. Indeed, it was necessary for the jury to assess the credibility of the accused‚Äôs evidence, which was the most relevant and material issue with which the jury would have had to grapple. To deny the accused the ability to point to his relationship would in these circumstances disable the jury from meaningfully performing its central function of finding facts and seeking out the truth, and would force the accused to tell an incomplete story ‚Äî a story which includes an account of the act but no explanation for how he and the complainant ‚Äúgot there‚Äù and why he said what he said and did what he did. Without the evidence, the accused‚Äôs actions will have appeared to have arisen out of nowhere, and the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence would be reduced to painting a picture of himself as (at best) crude and reckless, or (at worst) predatory.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordering a new trial is unfair, given that the Crown‚Äôs theory of the case drew directly from the sexual nature of the relationship and that it was the Crown, and not the accused, who contravened the trial judge‚Äôs evidentiary ruling and explored both the details and the frequency of the sexual activity. A successful Crown appeal from acquittal in this case inevitably lowers the bar which the Crown must overcome to show that a legal error had a material bearing on the acquittal so as to secure a new trial.</p>

Nearly 30 years later, the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault continues to be plagued by myths.<span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup> </sup></span>One such myth is that sexual assault is a crime committed by persons who are strangers to their targets. In fact, in 2016-2017, Statistics Canada found that over 80 percent of reported sexual assaults occurred between people who knew one another in some way.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;

This case requires the Court to review the balance between, on the one hand, admitting evidence of a sexual relationship that may be fundamental to making full answer and defence, and on the other, protecting complainants and the integrity of the trial process from prejudicial reasoning.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par3" class="">3</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the accused sought to introduce evidence that he and the complainant were ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù, a sexual relationship. He argued that the sexual nature of the relationship provided important context without which the jury would be left with the artificial impression that he and the complainant had a platonic relationship, rendering consent improbable.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par4" class="">4</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be admissible, relationship evidence that implies sexual activity must satisfy the requirements of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec276" target="_blank">s. 276<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. In my view, the evidence here did not meet those requirements. Introducing evidence of the sexual nature of the relationship served no purpose other than to support the inference that because the complainant had consented in the past, she was more likely to have consented on the night in question. It was therefore barred by s. 276(1). Nor could it satisfy the conditions of admissibility under s. 276(2). While the sexual aspect of the relationship was evidence of ‚Äúspecific instances of sexual activity‚Äù, it was not ‚Äúrelevant to an issue at trial‚Äù.</p>

In other words, relevance is the key which unlocks the evidentiary bar, allowing a judge to consider the s. 276(3) factors and to decide whether to admit the evidence. Bare assertions that such evidence will be relevant to context, narrative or credibility cannot satisfy s.&nbsp;276. The evidence in this case should not have been admitted and a new trial is required. I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

At some point during the ensuing months, the two resumed contact. Although they each described the relationship in various ways, both ultimately agreed that their relationship could be described as ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par7" class="">7</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening of May 28, 2014, the complainant called Goldfinch, who then drove to the complainant‚Äôs house, picked her up, and brought her back to his place. Goldfinch testified that she had called him a few days earlier asking for ‚Äúbirthday sex‚Äù, something the complainant couldn‚Äôt remember if she had done. Goldfinch stated that he did not ‚Äú100 percent‚Äù expect to have sex that evening, ‚Äúbut that was our routine‚Äù (A.R., vol. III, at p. 228). In his view, this was a ‚Äútypical evening‚Äù in that the complainant ‚Äúwould call in the middle of the night, want to come over, and we‚Äôd end up going to bed together‚Äù (A.R., vol. III, at p. 201).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par8" class="">8</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goldfinch lived in the basement of a small, older home which he shared with a roommate. After arriving at the house, Goldfinch and the complainant shared drinks and conversation with the roommate while watching television. Goldfinch testified that, during this time, he mouthed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you‚Äù to the complainant. He says she responded with a smile. The complainant couldn‚Äôt remember whether this exchange had occurred, but acknowledged that it might have.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par9" class="">9</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few minutes later, Goldfinch invited the complainant to go downstairs. The complainant testified that she told Goldfinch ‚Äúnothing was going to happen‚Äù, meaning that she did not wish to have sex. Goldfinch denies ever hearing this.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par10" class="">10</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Downstairs, the two sat on a couch together. At some point, they shared a consensual kiss. After the kiss, Goldfinch suggested that they go to bed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par11" class="">11</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From this point on, the two accounts of the evening diverged radically.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par12" class="">12</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Goldfinch, after the consensual kiss, he followed the complainant into his bedroom where they each removed their own clothes. He and the complainant then discussed which side of the bed they wished to sleep on. Following this discussion, the two engaged in consensual foreplay and brief intercourse. He fell asleep and, hours later, she woke him up complaining that he had struck her on the head in his sleep. He was annoyed, told her to leave and called a taxi using her phone.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par13" class="">13</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that she responded to Goldfinch‚Äôs invitation by telling him she did not want to have sex. He then grabbed her arm and dragged her into the bedroom. She explained that Goldfinch‚Äôs demeanour changed, ‚Äú[j]ust like something snapped‚Äù (A.R., vol. II, at p. 88), and she felt scared. She removed her clothes because he told her to. He pushed her onto the bed, struck her in the face, pushed her shoulder so hard that she believed her arm was broken, and told her ‚Äúhe was going to have [her], just like everyone else‚Äù (A.R., vol. II, at p. 91). Following the assault, she dressed and called a taxi from her cell phone. She called the police shortly after she arrived back at her home. Both the responding officer and a forensics officer who met the complainant at the hospital confirmed swelling on her left cheek and elbow.</p>

Counsel advanced that Goldfinch did not intend to rely on twin-myth inferences, but failed to identify any <i>other </i>inference or relevant use beyond ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. The Crown was willing to adduce evidence that the two knew each other for four to five years, dated and lived together for seven to eight months, and then broke up. The Crown was also prepared to adduce evidence that the two remained friends and that the complainant would occasionally come to Goldfinch‚Äôs house and stay overnight.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par15" class="">15</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted that ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù meant that ‚Äúthey were friends who . . . from time to time got together to have sex‚Äù (A.R., vol.

She concluded this ‚Äúrelatively benign‚Äù evidence would not ‚Äúprejudice the complainant‚Äôs personal dignity, right to privacy, or personal security‚Äù if admitted in this limited form.</p>

The trial judge stated that she had envisioned that the ‚Äúcontextual information‚Äù identified in the <i>voir dire</i> would be reduced to an agreed statement of facts. But, because the parties had not done so, the trial judge reiterated her expectation that any questioning would be ‚Äúextremely limited‚Äù, following ‚Äúfairly narrow confines for the purposes of context and to simply let the jury know the nature of the relationship‚Äù (A.R., vol.

The trial judge agreed that the Crown had opened the evidentiary door and gave the defence permission to ask questions regarding ‚Äúthe number of times, the time frame relative to the relationship proper breaking up, and the last occasion prior to these alleged offences‚Äù (A.R., vol. II, at p. 112). During cross-examination, when defence counsel suggested the two had slept together ‚Äúdozens of times‚Äù, the complainant estimated they had slept together 15 times following the breakup.</p>

 <p class="Citation1" style="margin-right:0in;text-indent:.25in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The Crown appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law by admitting the evidence, pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec276" target="_blank">section 276<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, of the prior sexual relationship between [Goldfinch] and the complainant.

Thus, they concluded that the trial judge failed to connect the relationship evidence to any issue relevant to Goldfinch‚Äôs defence. The majority also rejected the argument that the evidence was relevant to Goldfinch‚Äôs credibility or as ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. In their view, permitting the defence to lead evidence of previous sexual activity to prevent the jury from concluding that consent was <i>unlikely</i> was no different from admitting that same evidence to establish that the complainant was <i>more</i> <i>likely</i> to consent. Given the admissions the Crown had been willing to make, there was no risk that the jury would be misled into thinking Goldfinch and the complainant were strangers. The only inferences to be drawn from the evidence of prior sexual activity could be those relying on the twin myths. In the majority‚Äôs view, limiting instructions could not cure the fact that the jury had heard inadmissible evidence for which there was no permissible use. They allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.</p>

He found that the trial judge had properly exercised her discretion in admitting what she characterized as ‚Äúrelatively benign‚Äù evidence in order to preclude misapprehensions on the part of the jury. In his view, Goldfinch‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence required a ‚Äúcandid revelation of the true nature of the relationship‚Äù (para. 67). For Berger J.A., it was better to trust the jury to rely on the limiting instructions mandated for evidence admitted under s. 276 than to leave the jury to speculate on what lay beneath Crown admissions for which no such instructions would be required.</p>

This guarantee includes the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence, itself crucial to ensuring that the innocent are not convicted (<i>R. v.

The right to a fair trial does not, however, guarantee the most favourable procedures imaginable: the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence is not automatically breached whenever relevant evidence is excluded (<i>R. v. Quesnelle</i>, 2014 SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, at para. 64; <i>R. v. Darrach</i>, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, at para. 24; <i>Mills</i>, at para. 75). A fair trial also requires that no party be allowed to distort the process by producing irrelevant or prejudicial evidence (<i>Darrach</i>, at para. 24).</p>

Handy</i>, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at para.&nbsp;39). However, such evidence often draws on pejorative or judgmental generalizations (D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i> (7th ed. 2015), at p. 54). This is problematic because ‚Äú[b]ad character is not an offence known to the law‚Äù (<i>Handy</i>, at para. 72). Our legal system neither punishes nor protects people on the basis of lifestyle, character or reputation. To protect against propensity reasoning, trial judges must balance the probative value of such evidence against its prejudicial effects.</p>

Moreover, because only the accused is being judged at trial, exclusionary rules generally do not prevent the accused from adducing evidence of another person‚Äôs bad character (Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 98).</p>

The provisions were intended to counter the twin myths that women with sexual experience are more likely to consent to sexual activity or are less worthy of belief. Because sexual assault was highly gendered and underreported, Parliament also sought to encourage the reporting of sexual crimes (<i>Seaboyer</i>, at p. 606, per McLachlin J., and pp. 648-50, per L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√© J., dissenting in part).</p>

Improperly excluded evidence critical to the defence included evidence going to: (i) honest but mistaken belief in consent, (ii) bias or motive to fabricate on the part of the complainant, (iii) physical conditions establishing the use of force, and (iv) evidence of a consistent <i>modus operandi</i> such as threatening to accuse someone of rape as a means of extortion (<i>Seaboyer</i>, at pp. 613-16).</p>

Sexual assault is <i>still</i> among the most highly gendered and underreported crimes (J. Desrosiers and G. Beausoleil-Allard, <i>L‚Äôagression sexuelle en droit canadien</i> (2nd ed. 2017), at pp. 41-42). Even hard-fought battles to stop sexual assault in the workplace remain ongoing (compare, e.g., K. Lippel, ‚ÄúConceptualising Violence at Work Through A Gender Lens: Regulation and Strategies for Prevention and Redress‚Äù (2018), 1 <i>U</i> <i>of OxHRH J</i> 142,<i> </i>and C. Backhouse, ‚ÄúSexual Harassment: A Feminist Phrase That Transformed the Workplace‚Äù (2012), 24 <i>C.J.W.L. </i>275). As time passes, our understanding of the profound impact sexual violence can have on a victim‚Äôs physical and mental health only deepens. Parliament enacted s. 276 to address concrete social prejudices that affect trial fairness as well as the concrete harms caused to the victims of sexual assault. Throughout their lives, survivors may experience a constellation of physical and psychological symptoms including: high rates of depression; anxiety, sleep, panic and eating disorders; substance dependence; self-harm and suicidal behaviour.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">[4]</span></sup></span></sup></span></a> A recent Department of Justice study estimated the costs of sexual assault at approximately $4.8 billion in 2009, an astonishing $4.6 billion of which related to survivors‚Äô medical costs, lost productivity (due in large part to mental health disability), and costs from pain and suffering.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

Sections 276(1) and (2) operate together to achieve this objective. First, s. 276(1) sets out an absolute bar against introducing evidence of the complainant‚Äôs prior sexual activity for the purpose of drawing twin-myth inferences. Where an accused seeks to introduce such evidence for some other purpose, that evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless the accused satisfies s. 276(2). To do so, the accused must identify the evidence and its purpose with sufficient precision to allow the judge to apply s. 276(2) and weigh the factors set out in s. 276(3).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par43" class="">43</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 276(1) bars evidence of a complainant‚Äôs previous sexual activity tendered to support the twin myths. Such evidence is ‚Äúnot probative of consent or credibility and can severely distort the trial process‚Äù (<i>Darrach</i>, at para. 33). In barring such inferences, the provision affirms the equality and dignity rights of complainants and aims to encourage reporting of sexual assault (Bill C-49). The risk that evidence of a relationship which implies sexual activity may be used to support twin-myth reasoning is clear.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par44" class="">44</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider the first myth: that a complainant‚Äôs prior sexual activity may support an inference of consent in a particular instance. Rejection of this myth ‚Äî and its link to relationships ‚Äî is intimately connected to the modern understanding of consent. Until 1983, the fact that an accused was married to a complainant was sufficient to legitimize sexual assault; indeed, rape was defined as non-consensual sexual intercourse between a man and ‚Äúa female person who is not his wife‚Äù (<i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 143). Today, an accused may no longer argue that consent was implied by a relationship: contemporaneous, affirmatively communicated consent must be given for each and every sexual act (<i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>, [1999]&nbsp;1&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;330; <i>R. v. J.A.</i>, 2011 SCC 28, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 440, at paras. 34 and 47; <i>R.</i>&nbsp;<i>v. Hutchinson</i>, 2014 SCC 19, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 346, at para. 27; <i>R. v. Barton</i>, 2019&nbsp;SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at paras. 90-94). Today, not only does no mean no, but only yes means yes. Nothing less than positive affirmation is required.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par45" class="">45</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider also the second myth: that previous sexual activity renders a complainant less worthy of belief or, by extension, of full protection of the law (<i>Barton</i>, at para. 201, per Moldaver J. and, at paras. 222 and 231, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ.). Before this Court, Goldfinch advanced that social mores have changed such that being ‚Äúunchaste‚Äù no longer discredits a complainant. However, this Court has held that the second myth is not limited to attitudes towards ‚Äúunchaste‚Äù women (<i>Darrach</i>, at para. 33). Moreover, while sexual activity generally carries less stigma than it once did, complainants continue to be treated as less deserving of belief based on their previous sexual conduct. The notion that some complainants ‚Äúinvite‚Äù assault and, by inference, do not deserve protection persists both inside and outside our courtrooms (<i>R. v. Barton</i>, 2017 ABCA 216, 354 C.C.C. (3d) 245, at para. 128, cited in <i>Barton</i>, at para. 201, per Moldaver J. and, at para. 231, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ.; see also E. Craig, <i>Putting Trials on Trial: Sexual Assault and the Failure of the Legal Profession</i> (2018), at pp. 32 et seq.). This is implicit in the continued struggle to exclude inaccurate assumptions about what constitutes ‚Äútypical‚Äù or ‚Äúunusual‚Äù activity within a given relationship (see, e.g., E. Craig, ‚ÄúSection 276 Misconstrued: The Failure to Properly Interpret and Apply Canada‚Äôs Rape Shield Provisions‚Äù (2016), 94 <i>Can. Bar Rev.</i> 45, at p. 69; M. Randall, ‚ÄúSexual Assault in Spousal Relationships, ‚ÄòContinuous Consent‚Äô, and the Law: Honest But Mistaken Judicial Beliefs‚Äù (2008), 32 <i>Man. L.J.</i> 144; C. Boyle, ‚ÄúSexual Assault as Foreplay: Does <i>Ewanchuk</i> Apply to Spouses?‚Äù (2004), 20 C.R. (6th) 359). Finally, the suggestion that sexual assault is less harmful to those who are sexually active or in relationships is simply wrong (see, e.g., J. Koshan, ‚ÄúMarriage and Advance Consent to Sex: A Feminist Judgment in <i>R v JA</i>‚Äù (2016), 6:6 <i>O√±ati Socio-legal Series</i> 1377 (online), at pp. 1387 and 1391).</p>

If the accused cannot point to a relevant use of the evidence <i>other than</i> the twin myths, mere assurances that evidence will not be used for those purposes are insufficient. This case highlights the dangers of accepting such assurances.</p>

As I set out in the sections that follow, the difficulty here was not that Goldfinch and the complainant had a relationship, but that Goldfinch could point to no relevant use for evidence of the <i>sexual</i> nature of the relationship. Such an approach misapprehends the nature of consent and is barred by s. 276(1).</p>

Rodney</i>, 2008 CanLII 5114 (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v. A.R.C.</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 5364 (QL) (S.C.J.))<i>.</i> This position fails to recognize the purposes of the provision.</p>

The requirement that evidence be ‚Äúspecific‚Äù prevents aimless or sweeping inquiries into the complainant‚Äôs sexual history. The accused must point to identifiable activity, but the degree of specificity required in a particular case will depend on the nature of the evidence, how the accused intends to use it, and its potential to prejudice the proper administration of justice. As Doherty J.A. noted in <i>L.S.</i>,<i> </i>specificity is required so that judges may apply the scheme in a way that effectively protects the rights of the complainant and ensures trial fairness. A purposive interpretation thus calls for evidence that is sufficiently specific to support a fully informed analysis, allowing the judge to circumscribe what evidence may be adduced and how it may be used.</p>

Requiring further details would unnecessarily invade the complainant‚Äôs privacy, defeating an important objective of the provision. I agree with the statement in <i>L.S.</i> that specifying the parties to the relationship, the nature of that relationship and the relevant time period satisfies the purposes of trial fairness (para. 83). Those criteria are met in this case.</p>

Section&nbsp;276.1(2) requires the accused to set out, in writing, the ‚Äúdetailed particulars‚Äù of the evidence to be adduced as well as the ‚Äúrelevance of th[e] evidence to an issue at trial‚Äù. The application judge must be satisfied that the evidence is capable of being admitted under s. 276(2) before ordering a <i>voir dire</i> (s. 276.1(4)(c)). Judges who admit such evidence must also provide written reasons identifying the relevance of the evidence admitted (s. 276.2(3)(c)).<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par56" class="">56</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It goes without saying that the ‚Äúrelevant issue‚Äù cannot be one of the twin myths prohibited by s. 276(1).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:none"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;

Credibility is an issue that pervades most trials, and ‚Äú[e]vidence of prior sexual activity will rarely be relevant to support a denial that sexual activity took place or to establish consent‚Äù (<i>Darrach</i>, at para. 58; see also <i>Handy</i>, at paras. 115-16). Arguments for relevance must be scrutinized to ensure ‚Äúcontext‚Äù is not simply a disguised myth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par57" class="">57</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, a relationship may provide relevant context quite apart from any sexual activity. Where the relationship is defined as including sexual activity, as the trial judge held ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù was here, it is critical that the relevance of the <i>sexual nature</i> of the relationship to an issue at trial be identified with <i>precision</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par58" class="">58</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the <i>voir dire</i>, Goldfinch described relevance in general terms: the evidence was necessary for ‚Äúcontext‚Äù or to prevent ‚Äúfaulty impressions‚Äù. He was not merely concerned with dispelling the notion that he and the complainant were strangers: he specifically sought to introduce the sexual nature of the relationship. The trial judge was clearly alive to the possibility that this could be used to support the twin myths. In the end, however, the trial judge concluded that the evidence was relevant because it put the relationship ‚Äúin proper context‚Äù. In coming to this conclusion, she relied on <i>R. v. Strickland </i>(2007), 45 C.R. (6th) 183 (Ont. S.C.J.). In that case, the trial judge reasoned that the probative value of ‚Äúcontextual‚Äù relationship evidence did not support an inference of ‚Äúan increased likelihood of consent‚Äù but rather could dispel an inference of ‚Äúthe unlikelihood of consent‚Äù (para. 35).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par59" class="">59</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, that is a distinction without a difference. Three paragraphs from <i>Strickland</i> illustrate why:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be said that, as a general rule, people do not have sexual intercourse with complete strangers. Generally speaking, sexual partners are involved in a relationship of some sort. . . . What does matter is that, at some point, each partner has made an assessment of the other, and decided that that person is a suitable person with whom to share this most intimate human experience.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:13.7pt">It is the fact that such a decision was made in the past by the complainant that is relevant. . . .

However, an honest but mistaken belief cannot simply rest upon evidence that a person consented at ‚Äúsome point‚Äù in the past: that would be twin-myth reasoning. By definition, the defence must rely upon evidence of <i>how</i> the complainant previously communicated consent so that the accused can adequately support a belief that consent was expressed. Here, the trial judge properly instructed the jury not to rely on the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence in evaluating the defence of honest but mistaken belief.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par63" class="">63</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of a sexual relationship may also be relevant when complainants have offered inconsistent statements regarding the very existence of a sexual relationship with the accused (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Harris</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 498 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Temertzoglou </i>(2002), 11 C.R. (6th) 179 (Ont. S.C.J.)). There were no such contradictory statements from the complainant in the record at the time of the <i>voir dire</i> and Goldfinch did not proceed on this basis.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par64" class="">64</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that Goldfinch sought to establish a pattern of behaviour, the ‚Äúpattern‚Äù here was hardly distinctive; it would not be admissible as similar fact evidence (<i>Handy</i>, at paras. 82, 127 and 131). As I have noted, the limited admissibility of similar fact evidence protects the truth-seeking function of the trial by excluding evidence that is overly prejudicial to the accused. By imposing the same evidentiary standard under s.&nbsp;276, neither the accused nor the complainant is denied equal protection of the law on the basis of lifestyle, character or reputation (Craig, ‚ÄúSection 276 Misconstrued‚Äù, at p. 71).</p>

There will, of course, be circumstances in which context will be relevant for the jury to properly understand and assess the evidence. That assessment, however, must be free of twin-myth reasoning. General arguments that the sexual nature of a relationship is relevant to context, narrative or credibility will not suffice to bring the evidence within the purview of s.&nbsp;276(2).</p>

M. (M.)</i> (1999), 29 C.R. (5th) 85 (Ont. S.C.J.)). In both of these cases, the evidence admitted was fundamental to the coherence of the defence narrative. It was not merely helpful context.

He advanced that his narrative would be inherently improbable if the jury did not know he and the complainant were ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù. Among other things, he argued that the evidence was relevant to the jury‚Äôs assessment of the complainant‚Äôs call suggesting Goldfinch owed her ‚Äúbirthday sex‚Äù as well as to his testimony that the complainant smiled when he mouthed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you‚Äù.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;

The complainant‚Äôs request for ‚Äúbirthday sex‚Äù does not reflect on Goldfinch‚Äôs character or behaviour.

Both considerations must receive heightened attention as ‚Äú[the test] . . . serves to direct judges to the serious ramifications of the use of evidence of prior sexual activity for all parties‚Äù (<i>Darrach</i>, at para. 40). Balancing the s. 276(3) factors ultimately depends on the nature of the evidence being adduced and the factual matrix of the case. It will depend, in part, on how important the evidence is to the accused‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence. For example, the relative value of sexual history evidence will be significantly reduced if the accused can advance a particular theory <i>without</i> referring to that history. In contrast, where that evidence directly implicates the accused‚Äôs ability to raise a reasonable doubt, the evidence is obviously fundamental to full answer and defence (<i>Mills</i>, at paras. 71 and 94). This was not the case here: Goldfinch‚Äôs right to full answer and defence would not have been compromised by excluding the sexual nature of the relationship.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par70" class="">70</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, having found that the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence was not relevant to an issue at trial, it follows that it has no probative value. The evidence was relevant only to suggest that the complainant was more likely to have consented because she had done so in the past. Thus the evidence went only to the twin myths which, as Gonthier J. held in <i>Darrach</i>, are ‚Äúnot probative of consent or credibility and can severely distort the trial process‚Äù (para. 33).</p>

That evidence clearly engages twin-myth reasoning by suggesting that because the complainant had ‚Äútypically‚Äù consented to sex with Goldfinch in the past, she was more likely to have done so on this ‚Äúroutine‚Äù occasion. Admitting that evidence was a reversible error of law which might reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on the acquittal (<i>Graveline</i>, at para. 14).</p>

No means no, and only yes means yes: even in the context of an established relationship, even part way through a sexual encounter, and even if the act is one the complainant has routinely consented to in the past.

This requires two observations. First, I note that Crown counsel would not have adduced this evidence but for the s. 276 application, which I have concluded should not have been granted. While the parties did not have the benefit of this Court‚Äôs recent holding in <i>Barton</i>, I would reiterate that Crown-led evidence of prior sexual activity must be governed by the principles set out in s. 276(1) and <i>Seaboyer</i> (<i>Barton</i>, at paras. 68, 80 and 197). Second, proper management of evidence which falls within the scope of the s. 276 regime requires vigilance from all trial participants, but especially trial judges ‚Äî the ultimate evidentiary gatekeepers. Leading evidence through an agreed statement of facts, as the trial judge suggested here, is one way to do so.</p>

The incident resulted in Mr. Goldfinch being charged with both assault and sexual assault. Mr. Goldfinch maintained his innocence, claiming that the sexual activity in question was consensual.</p>

The Crown opposed the admission of this evidence. Following a <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge ruled that the evidence was admissible for the dual purposes of providing context to the events in question and avoiding an erroneous misapprehension on the part of the jury that Mr. Goldfinch and the complainant were platonic friends. The trial ended with the jury acquitting Mr. Goldfinch of both assault and sexual assault.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par80" class="">80</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs acquittals to the Alberta Court of Appeal. A majority of that court overturned the acquittals, holding that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the nature of Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs relationship with the complainant ‚Äî ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù ‚Äî at the time of the alleged assault. In the majority‚Äôs view, this evidence was inadmissible because it did nothing more than advance one of the twin myths prohibited by s. 276(1) ‚Äî namely, that the complainant was more likely to have consented on the night in question because she had previously engaged in sex with Mr. Goldfinch. Justice Berger dissented. In his view, the impugned evidence was admissible under s. 276(2) because it was integral to Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence. Mr. Goldfinch now appeals to this Court as of right.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par81" class="">81</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The s. 276 regime is sometimes viewed as a zero-sum game pitting the rights of the complainant against those of the accused. But in my respectful view, this is a mischaracterization. The s. 276 regime is designed to respect and preserve the rights of <i>both </i>complainants and accused persons by excluding evidence which would undermine the legitimacy of our criminal justice system and inhibit the search for truth, while allowing for the admission of evidence which would enhance the legitimacy of our criminal justice system and promote the search for truth. In this way, the regime seeks to promote the integrity of the trial process as a whole ‚Äî a concept that is essential to the public‚Äôs faith in the criminal justice system.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par82" class="">82</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In pursuing this objective, the s. 276 regime operates in a step-by-step manner. From the accused‚Äôs initial application under s. 276.1 to the final limiting instruction required by s. 276.4, the s. 276 regime establishes a rigorous, multistep process through which sexual activity evidence adduced by or on behalf of the accused must be carefully vetted and winnowed down to its essentials. To make its way into evidence at trial, such evidence must withstand careful scrutiny at each stage of the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par83" class="">83</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I will explain, for sexual activity evidence to be admitted under s.&nbsp;276(2), the accused must demonstrate, at a minimum, that the evidence goes to a legitimate<i> </i>aspect of his defence and is integral to his ability to make full answer and defence. This requires that the accused be able to identify specific facts or issues relating to his defence that can be properly understood and resolved by the trier of fact only if reference is made to the sexual activity evidence in question. Further, to the extent sexual activity evidence is ultimately admitted, the trial judge must explain to the jury, in clear and precise terms, the uses for which the evidence may ‚Äî and may <i>not </i>‚Äî be used. Finally, <i>all </i>trial participants ‚Äî including the trial judge, Crown and defence counsel, and witnesses ‚Äî must hew to the specific, legitimate purpose for which the evidence has been admitted, without expanding the scope of the ruling or using the admissible evidence for inadmissible purposes. This is essential to preserving not only the rights of the accused and the complainant, but also the integrity of the trial process as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

Furthermore, the improper admission of this evidence for the broad purpose of providing ‚Äúcontext‚Äù led to a significant and highly prejudicial broadening of the sexual activity evidence at trial. This, in my view, might reasonably have had a material bearing on Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs acquittal. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>

The main point that separates us is that while my colleague concludes that the sexual activity evidence in question ‚Äî the existence of a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship ‚Äî is categorically barred from being admitted under s. 276, I take a more nuanced approach. In particular, as I will explain at paras. 121-125 of these reasons, I would leave open the question of whether the presiding judge at the new trial might, if presented with a properly framed s. 276.1 application, admit the evidence after applying the test and weighing the factors set out in s. 276(2) and (3). Having foreshadowed these points, I turn to my analysis.</p>

In doing so, it gives effect to the principle that these myths ‚Äúare simply not relevant at trial‚Äù and ‚Äúcan severely distort the trial process‚Äù (<i>R. v. Darrach</i>, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, at para. 33). Accordingly, if the sole purpose for which sexual activity evidence is being proffered is to support either of the twin myths, it will be ruled inadmissible under s. 276(1) ‚Äî it is as simple as that.</p>

Where the accused can identify a legitimate purpose for introducing the evidence ‚Äî one that does not involve twin-myth reasoning ‚Äî admission remains a possibility. In this regard, s. 276(2) provides that while sexual activity evidence adduced by or on behalf of the accused is presumptively inadmissible, regardless of the purpose for which it is proffered, such evidence may be admitted where it satisfies a three-part test:</p>

However, if the judge is <i>not</i> satisfied that each of these three requirements has been met (e.g., the written application is deficient), then he or she may dismiss the application without more. Thus, for example, where a written application under s. 276.1 does not satisfy the judge that the evidence sought to be adduced is relevant to an issue at trial, it can be dismissed without holding a <i>voir dire</i>. While the parties in this case have not focused their submissions on the s. 276.1 requirements, these requirements, and the consequences for failing to meet them, should be kept in mind going forward.</p>

This requires that the accused be able to identify specific facts or issues relating to his defence that can be properly understood and resolved by the trier of fact only if reference is made to the sexual activity evidence in question. In articulating these specific facts or issues, simply citing the need to provide greater ‚Äúcontext‚Äù or a fuller ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù will not suffice. Indeed, if this were enough to justify the admission of sexual activity evidence, then the s. 276 regime would be reduced to a mere statutory speed bump along the way to admission.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par96" class="">96</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the requirement that the evidence be ‚Äúintegral‚Äù to the accused‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence means that even if the evidence can be linked to specific facts or issues relating to the accused‚Äôs defence, admission is not guaranteed. There may be cases in which the evidence, while relevant to specific facts or issues relating to the accused‚Äôs defence, bears only marginally on it. In such cases, the trial judge may, in his or her discretion, exclude the evidence on the basis that countervailing considerations, such as the need to protect the privacy rights and dignity of the complainant, outweigh the tenuous connection the evidence has to the accused‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence. &nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par97" class="">97</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With these points in mind, when applying this regime, trial judges must take a careful, rigorous approach ‚Äî one that recognizes and protects against the risks that accompany sexual activity evidence. The statutory requirements set out in s. 276(2) are designed to ensure that any admissible sexual activity evidence is limited in scope and that its legitimate purpose is identified and weighed against countervailing considerations. A careful application of these requirements is essential to the integrity of the trial process.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par98" class="">98</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The integrity of the trial process can be further protected by adopting certain best practices for communicating general relationship evidence, such as the kind sought to be adduced in this case, after an admissibility ruling has been made. As the Attorney General of Ontario (‚ÄúAGO‚Äù) suggested in its intervener submissions before this Court, where general relationship evidence is ruled admissible under s. 276(2), the parties should reduce that evidence to a clear and concise agreed statement of facts prior to trial. This statement would ensure that the evidence elicited at trial does not stray beyond the parameters of the trial judge‚Äôs ruling. Alternatively, the trial judge has the discretion to permit Crown and defence counsel to lead the complainant and the accused respectively through an accurate description of their relationship. These simple, prudent practices can go a long way to ensuring the scope of sexual activity evidence elicited at trial goes no further than necessary, thereby safeguarding the privacy rights and dignity of the complainant, preserving the integrity of the trial process, and promoting the search for truth.&nbsp;</p>

Any new bases for admissibility that emerge during the course of the trial should be the subject of a fresh s. 276 application. And when sexual activity evidence is ultimately elicited at trial, it should be followed swiftly by a mid-trial limiting instruction to the jury that identifies both the permissible and impermissible uses of the evidence. This instruction should be reinforced by a final jury instruction. In short, everyone must get crystal clear ‚Äî and <i>remain </i>crystal clear ‚Äî about why the evidence is being admitted.</p>

I will consider and apply these provisions in turn, keeping in mind that the analysis must remain fixed at the time of the <i>voir dire</i>.</p>

Whether general evidence of categories of relationships that <i>may or may not</i> involve sexual activity ‚Äî such as marriage, dating, etc. ‚Äî might also engage s. 276 is not before the Court. I would therefore leave that issue for another day. That said, without finally deciding the matter, I am inclined to the view that such evidence would not, without more, engage s. 276, as it does not amount to ‚Äúevidence that the complainant <u>has</u> engaged in sexual activity‚Äù (s. 276(1) and (2)). Of course, if the accused were to seek to go into details about the relationship revealing that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity ‚Äî for example, evidence that the accused and the complainant were in a spousal relationship <i>involving regular sex</i> (see <i>R. v. L.S.</i>, 2017 ONCA 685, 40 C.R. (7th) 351) ‚Äî then that evidence would have to pass through the s. 276 filter.</p>

On its face, this evidence could potentially be used to support the first of the twin myths ‚Äî the myth that because the complainant consented to have sex with Mr. Goldfinch in the past, she was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity forming the subject-matter of the sexual assault charge. However, s. 276(1) takes this potential use off the table. As such, unless Mr. Goldfinch could point to some <i>legitimate </i>use of the sexual activity evidence that would justify admission, that evidence was inadmissible. To determine whether a legitimate use justifying admission existed, we must turn to s. 276(2).</p>

In that case, the complainant and the accused were in a spousal relationship. The complainant alleged that the accused sexually assaulted her. The accused applied to introduce evidence of the nature of his relationship with the complainant under s. 276. The affidavit filed in support of his application stated that he and the complainant ‚Äúwere together as a couple for the entire year of 2009‚Äù and that they had an ‚Äúactive sex life for that year‚Äù in which they ‚Äúhad sex on a regular basis‚Äù (para. 53).</p>

He reasoned that the content of the ‚Äúspecific instances‚Äù requirement is linked to the nature of the evidence sought to be adduced. Where the accused seeks to introduce evidence of an individual instance of sexual activity, he must identify that instance with specificity. By contrast, where the accused seeks to introduce general evidence that describes the nature of the relationship between the accused and the complainant, ‚Äúthe specificity requirement speaks to factors relevant to identifying the relationship and its nature and not to details of specific sexual encounters‚Äù (para. 83). These factors will include ‚Äúthe parties to the relationship, the relevant time period, and the nature of the relationship‚Äù (para. 83).</p>

I will consider each argument in turn.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par115" class="">115</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of background, at the <i>voir dire </i>stage, Crown counsel proposed a statement of facts that did not include the existence of a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship between Mr. Goldfinch and the complainant. Instead, the proposed statement of facts stated that Mr. Goldfinch and the complainant had previously been in a romantic relationship for seven or eight months, during which time they lived together. It further stated that they were friends at the time of the events in question and the complainant sometimes spent the night at Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs residence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par116" class="">116</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with the first rationale advanced by Mr. Goldfinch is that it does not explain <i>why</i> it would be necessary to correct any potential ‚Äúmisapprehension‚Äù as to the sexual nature of his relationship with the complainant. A judge reviewing Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs application might legitimately conclude that the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence was being proffered solely to inform the jury that the two were occasionally engaging in sexual intercourse during the relevant time frame, and to potentially support the impermissible inference that it was more likely that the complainant consented on the night in question. If this was the sole reason for which the defence sought to correct the supposed ‚Äúmisapprehension‚Äù, then the evidence was inadmissible by virtue of s.&nbsp;276(1). Assuming, however, that there <i>may </i>have been a legitimate reason to correct any potential ‚Äúmisapprehension‚Äù on the part of the jury, Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs application did not identify one.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par117" class="">117</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the second rationale, Mr. Goldfinch argued that the sexual activity evidence was relevant to his defence because it provided ‚Äúcontext‚Äù to the events that formed the subject-matter of the sexual assault charge. The trial judge described the existence of an ongoing sexual relationship between the complainant and Mr. Goldfinch as a ‚Äúbackground piece of evidence‚Äù that the jurors could use when assessing the conflicting direct evidence ‚Äúas to whether or not the complainant did consent to the events in question‚Äù (A.R., vol.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par118" class="">118</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this line of reasoning paints with too broad a brushstroke. While it is true in every case that the existence of a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship between the complainant and the accused provides ‚Äúcontext‚Äù to the events at issue, neither Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs vaguely drafted affidavit nor his arguments at the <i>voir dire </i>stage specified the precise inference he wanted the jury to draw from that ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. Put differently, he failed to identify a specific, legitimate purpose for putting the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence before the jury ‚Äî he did not link the evidence to specific facts or issues relating to his defence that could be properly understood and resolved only if reference could be made to the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par119" class="">119</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where sexual activity evidence is concerned, the failure to identify the explicit link between the evidence and specific facts or issues relating to the accused‚Äôs defence can result in twin-myth reasoning slipping into the courtroom in the guise of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. For example, there is a risk that sexual activity evidence may be used, whether consciously or not, to ‚Äúcontextualize‚Äù a complainant‚Äôs testimony that she did not consent to the sexual activity in question through twin-myth reasoning: because the complainant consented in the past (the ‚Äúcontext‚Äù), it is more likely that she consented this time as well. This is, of course, precisely the sort of stereotypical reasoning s.&nbsp;276(1) sought to banish from the courtroom. Yet without a clear and precise identification of the specific purpose for which sexual activity evidence is sought to be introduced, this sort of reasoning can all too easily infiltrate the courtroom through the Trojan horse of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par120" class="">120</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the ‚Äúcontext‚Äù rationale offered by Mr. Goldfinch was insufficient to satisfy s. 276(2)(b). In my respectful view, any conclusion to the contrary would open the door to the admission of sexual activity evidence in every case where the complainant and the accused were in a previous or ongoing sexual relationship, so long as the accused cites the need for greater ‚Äúcontext‚Äù in his application. This cannot have been Parliament‚Äôs intent. The words ‚Äúcontext‚Äù and ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù do not, in my view, offer the accused a means of bypassing the measured analysis required by s. 276.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par121" class="">121</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the key flaw in Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs application was his failure to identify specific facts or issues relating to his defence that could be properly understood and resolved by the trier of fact only if reference was made to the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence. Some discussion of what I mean by ‚Äúspecific facts or issues relating to [the accused‚Äôs] defence‚Äù may prove helpful. As I will develop, without reaching any final decision on the matter, I note that in this case there was at least one specific issue that Mr. Goldfinch could have referred to in his application that might have properly supported admission of the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence: the jury‚Äôs assessment of Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs testimony that he mouthed the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you‚Äù to the complainant shortly before they went downstairs. In discussing this example below, I should not be taken as foreclosing the possibility that additional facts or issues relating to Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs defence may be identified at the new trial that might support the admission of the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence.</p>

If the jury lacked the knowledge that the two were in a sexual relationship at the time, this statement by Mr. Goldfinch might have seemed bizarre or even menacing.

In this way, withholding the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence from the jury could have led them to make an adverse credibility determination against Mr. Goldfinch that they otherwise would not have made. A jury‚Äôs determination of which witnesses to find credible is a holistic exercise that involves assessing the plausibility and coherence of a given witness‚Äôs testimony throughout the course of the trial. Withholding the sexual nature of Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs relationship with the complainant could have had an adverse impact on the jury‚Äôs assessment of Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs credibility, potentially infringing upon his right to make full answer and defence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par124" class="">124</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be clear, however, just as generic references to ‚Äúcontext‚Äù or ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù will not suffice to justify the admission of sexual activity evidence under s. 276(2), bare invocations of ‚Äúcredibility‚Äù will not be enough. Credibility is a key issue in almost every sexual assault trial ‚Äî the centrality of credibility assessments does not, however, allow the accused to bypass the rigours of s. 276. Instead, where credibility is concerned, the accused must identify specific facts or issues that require reference to the sexual activity evidence to be understood and that could have a material impact on a credibility assessment.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par125" class="">125</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Returning to the case at hand, Mr. Goldfinch might have been able to establish a legitimate link between the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence and his credibility by pointing to the need to enable the jury to properly assess his testimony that he mouthed the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you‚Äù to the complainant. Had Mr. Goldfinch referenced this aspect of his anticipated testimony in his s. 276 application, the trial judge would have been better equipped to engage in the balancing exercise required by s. 276(2) and (3). Indeed, she may have properly determined that the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence was admissible for the narrow purpose of allowing the jury to assess Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs testimony on this point. She may have further found that the impact on the complainant‚Äôs privacy rights and dignity would be limited, as the bare fact that Mr. Goldfinch and the complainant were in a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship at the time of the alleged sexual assault would be unlikely to unduly arouse the jury‚Äôs sentiments and would not require a sweeping and prejudicial inquiry into the complainant‚Äôs sexual history. She may have also determined that admission of the evidence was necessary to ensure Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par126" class="">126</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, the fact remains that in this case the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence was admitted for a different ‚Äî and much broader ‚Äî purpose. It was ushered into the courtroom under the broad banner of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù, without any identification of the specific facts or issues relating to Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs defence that required reference to this ‚Äúcontext‚Äù to be properly understood and resolved. In short, Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs application lacked the specificity and precision required to justify admission of the evidence in question.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par127" class="">127</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I conclude that Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs s. 276 application did not satisfy the ‚Äúrelevant to an issue at trial‚Äù requirement under s. 276(2)(b). Accordingly, it ought to have been denied.</p>
 <p class="Title4LevelTitre4Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">(c)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Probative Value Versus Potential Prejudicial Effect</p>

As this Court explained in <i>Darrach</i>, ‚Äú[t]he requirement of ‚Äòsignificant probative value‚Äô serves to exclude evidence of trifling relevance that, even though not used to support the two forbidden inferences, would still endanger the ‚Äòproper administration of justice‚Äô‚Äù (para. 41).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par129" class="">129</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence that is not relevant under s. 276(2)(b) is<i> </i>necessarily incapable of possessing any probative value, as the concept of probative value presupposes that the evidence bears on a relevant issue. Thus, given my conclusion that the sexual activity evidence in this case was not relevant to an issue at trial based on the application presented to the trial judge, I conclude that the evidence was incapable of satisfying the third requirement under s. 276(2).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par130" class="">130</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, in the interest of providing further guidance, I will briefly explain why the lack of specificity in Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs application also adversely impacted the trial judge‚Äôs ability to balance the probative value of the evidence against its potential prejudicial effect as required by s. 276(2)(c).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par131" class="">131</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To enable the trial judge to properly assess whether sexual activity evidence sought to be adduced has significant probative value that substantially outweighs its potential prejudicial effect, the accused must situate the evidence within the particular factual matrix of the case at hand. It is only through awareness of specific facts or issues that require the admission of the evidence that the trial judge can determine whether the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice presented by the evidence is outweighed by its probative value. The trial judge tasked with performing this balancing exercise will not be aided by generic references to ‚Äúcontext‚Äù, ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù, or potential ‚Äúmisapprehensions‚Äù; more is needed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par132" class="">132</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is underscored by the fact that the trial judge must consider a number of factors under s. 276(3) when making a determination under s. 276(2). These factors are specific in nature and require that the trial judge be in a position to evaluate the precise impact that the exclusion of the evidence would have on the accused‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence. The accused must provide the trial judge with the necessary tools to perform this inquiry, including a precise and clearly articulated connection between the sexual activity evidence and specific facts or issues relating to his defence. Unfortunately, that was not done here.</p>

Section 276.4 provides that where sexual activity evidence is admitted pursuant to s. 276(2), ‚Äúthe judge shall instruct the jury as to the uses that the jury <u>may</u> and may not make of that evidence‚Äù. In this case, while the judge‚Äôs limiting instructions cautioned the jury not to use the evidence of the sexual nature of Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs relationship with the complainant to support either of the twin myths, the instructions did not identify any <i>permissible</i> use of this evidence. The trial judge‚Äôs final instruction to the jury on this point was as follows:</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:58.4pt;line-height:normal">You heard some evidence that Mr. Goldfinch and [the complainant] had dated, briefly lived together, and continued to have sexual relations on occasion in 2014. This evidence provides you with some context for their relationship. You must not use this evidence, however, to help you decide or infer that, because of the sexual nature of their relationship, [the complainant] is more likely to have con[s]ented to sexual intercourse with Mr. Goldfinch on May 29th, 2014. . . . Further, you must not use the evidence of their relationship to help you decide or infer that [the complainant] is less believable or reliable as a witness in this case&nbsp;. . . .</p>

However, the trial judge‚Äôs statement that the evidence provided the jury with ‚Äúsome context for their relationship‚Äù was insufficient. The instruction did not identify any specific use to which the jury could properly put the evidence. As a result, the jury was left in the dark about how they could use the evidence.&nbsp;</p>

Moreover, <span style="line-height:200%">compounding the risk of forbidden reasoning based on discriminatory generalizations, the trial judge admitted evidence of the complainant‚Äôs sexual activity going beyond the scope of her initial s. 276 ruling.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par139" class="">139</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">I note at the outset of this discussion that both the Crown and defence were responsible for adducing sexual activity evidence that went beyond the scope of the trial judge‚Äôs ruling. In my view, the fact that both defence and Crown counsel strayed beyond the boundaries of the judge‚Äôs ruling further illustrates the insufficiency of that initial ruling. Because the judge admitted the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence under the broad banner of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù, the parties were left without any clear guidance on what other pieces of sexual activity evidence might be admissible under this broad banner. They may well have thought that the door had been swung wide open on sexual activity evidence because <i>all</i> such evidence would provide ‚Äúcontext‚Äù to the events at issue in a general sense. Therefore, the overbreadth and irrelevance of the sexual activity evidence adduced at trial should serve as a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when the s. 276 regime is not properly observed. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par140" class="">140</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, both the complainant and Mr. Goldfinch were questioned about sexual activity that went beyond the scope of the s. 276 ruling. The trial judge initially determined that the only evidence which was admissible under s. 276(2) was the fact that the complainant and Mr. Goldfinch were in a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship. However, at trial, defence counsel cross-examined the complainant about how many times she had sex with Mr. Goldfinch following their breakup. This directly contravened one of the bases for the trial judge‚Äôs ruling ‚Äî namely, that any prejudice to the complainant‚Äôs privacy rights and dignity would be minimal because she would not be asked about the ‚Äúparticulars of . . . her sexual history with [Mr. Goldfinch]‚Äù (A.R., vol. I, at p. 11). That the complainant was ultimately asked about such particulars on cross-examination constituted a significant infringement on her privacy rights and dignity.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par141" class="">141</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, defence counsel asked the complainant about ‚Äúother partners‚Äù she may have had at the time she and Mr. Goldfinch were in a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship (A.R., vol. II, at p. 119). She testified that she had a sexual partner other than Mr. Goldfinch at the time. This evidence ran a serious risk of distorting the jury‚Äôs fact-finding process by inviting stereotypical reasoning about women and consent, such as the myth that women who are ‚Äúunchaste‚Äù are more likely to consent. I note that the defence did not apply to have the trial judge revisit her initial s. 276 ruling before eliciting this evidence. As such, the evidence was not the subject of a limiting instruction.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par142" class="">142</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also strayed beyond the bounds of the trial judge‚Äôs ruling. It is true that the Crown is not subject to the procedural requirements of ss. 276.1 and 276.2, which apply only where the <i>accused</i> seeks to adduce evidence of the complainant‚Äôs other sexual activity. However, the Crown is subject to s. 276(1)‚Äôs prohibition on twin myth reasoning and must also abide by the common law principles articulated by this Court in <i>Seaboyer</i>. Indeed, in <i>R. v. Barton</i>,<i> </i>2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, this Court stated that trial judges should determine the admissibility of Crown-led prior sexual activity evidence through a <i>voir dire </i>prior to trial, applying this Court‚Äôs guidance in <i>Seaboyer </i>(<i>Barton</i>,<i> </i>at para. 80).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par143" class="">143</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No such procedure was observed here. During direct examination of the complainant, Crown counsel elicited testimony that made reference to the complainant‚Äôs other sexual partner. <span style="line-height:200%">Further, in the Crown‚Äôs cross-examination of Mr. Goldfinch, counsel led Mr. Goldfinch to provide details of his sexual ‚Äúroutine‚Äù with the complainant ‚Äî namely, that they would generally have sex when the complainant stayed over at his house. This was prejudicial information about other instances of sexual activity by the complainant and should have been the subject of its own <i>voir dire </i>and ruling. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par144" class="">144</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">For reasons of procedural fairness, the fact that the Crown </span><span style="line-height:200%">strayed beyond the bounds of the trial judge‚Äôs ruling and </span><span style="line-height:200%">elicited additional sexual activity evidence that was not the subject of a <i>voir dire </i>clearly cannot be used as a basis for setting aside Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs acquittal. Put simply, the Crown cannot be permitted to benefit from its own missteps. Nevertheless, much of the improper evidence was led by the defence. This resulted from the erroneous admission of the ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence under the broad banner of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. In these circumstances, the </span><span style="line-height:200%">public interest in a trial that is conducted properly according to the law and the </span><span style="line-height:200%">need to protect the integrity of the justice system militate in favour of a new trial (see <i>R. v. Morrison</i>, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 142).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par145" class="">145</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">I would add that, as the AGO points out, vetting sexual activity evidence advanced by either Crown or defence before trial will have the salutary effect of focusing all parties on the legitimate use of such evidence. This approach will also ‚Äúestablish the parameters of any sexual relationship evidence that the Crown seeks to adduce‚Äù and trigger defence counsel to bring a separate application under s. 276(2) if they wish to elicit evidence going beyond the scope of that proposed by the Crown (I.F., at para. 14). </span>The failure to do so here led to the unnecessary and inappropriate admission of sexual activity evidence that went beyond the trial judge‚Äôs s. 276 ruling. This evidence came in without first having been vetted, and it was never the subject of its own limiting instruction. This was a serious error.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par146" class="">146</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be clear, I make no final determination as to whether any evidence going beyond the bare fact that Mr. Goldfinch and the complainant were ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù at the time of the alleged sexual assault might ultimately be found admissible at a new trial where it is subject to proper vetting. Here, I simply point out the overbreadth of the sexual activity evidence elicited at trial as a means of illustrating the adverse impact that an improper admissibility determination under s. 276 can have on the integrity of the trial process. This case serves as a powerful illustration of how a trial can go off the rails where sexual activity evidence is admitted without being anchored to a specific, legitimate purpose. Without this anchor, the trial may drift into unsafe waters, as occurred in this case.&nbsp; And while the trial judge in this case made an effort to mitigate the situation, the damage was already done ‚Äî Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs application should not have been allowed in the first place.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par147" class="">147</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, the errors at trial stemmed directly from the trial judge‚Äôs improper s. 276 ruling, which allowed for the admission of sexual activity evidence under the broad banner of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. Grounded in this ruling, the trial judge‚Äôs flawed limiting instructions failed to delineate how the sexual activity evidence was capable of assisting the jury to resolve specific facts or issues relating to Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs defence. This flawed instruction‚Äôs distorting effect was compounded when additional sexual activity evidence was admitted at trial which was not the subject of its own admissibility determination or limiting instruction. The cumulative impact of these errors, in my view, can reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on Mr. Goldfinch‚Äôs acquittal. Accordingly, I agree with the Court of Appeal that a new trial should be ordered.</p>

Her evidence was that she called the appellant to come over to his residence. After watching television together with the appellant‚Äôs roommate, she and the appellant went downstairs to his living quarters. She told him that ‚Äúnothing was going to happen‚Äù (A.R., vol. II, at p. 87), meaning there would be no sexual activity. After she did not join him in his bedroom, he got angry, dragged her into the bedroom, pushed her onto the bed, hit her face, and had sex with her while she repeatedly told him to stop.</p>

He picked her up and they drove back to his residence where they watched television and drank beer with his roommate. At some point, the appellant mouthed at her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you‚Äù (A.R., vol. III, at p. 198), after which the two walked downstairs together to his living quarters. He eventually followed her into his bedroom, where she got undressed before he did. They discussed which side of the bed she would sleep on to avoid ‚Äúhot flashes‚Äù that happen when she sleeps on one particular side of his bed. They had sex and fell asleep. He awoke to find her angry at him for hitting her in the face sometime while he was asleep. He became annoyed, and told her to leave.</p>

None of these submissions referred to the relationship. Rather, it was the Crown that relied on the relationship. Its theory was that, <i>because</i> they were in a sexual relationship, ‚ÄúMr. Goldfinch was expecting sex from [the complainant] that day. That‚Äôs the only reason he went to pick her up. When he found out that he was not going to get it, he snapped‚Äù (A.R., vol. III, at p. 286).</p>

I agree that this appeal turns on how to balance the admissibility of evidence of a relationship that may be a necessary link in making full answer and defence with ensuring triers of fact do not use the existence of a relationship to engage in prohibited reasoning. And while I agree with much of the majority‚Äôs overview of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec276" target="_blank">s. 276<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, we disagree on its application to this evidentiary record. The majority reasons that the relationship was simply not relevant to any issue before the jury, and therefore engaged the prohibited line of reasoning that ‚Äúbecause the complainant had consented to sex with Goldfinch in the past, in similar circumstances, it was more likely she had consented on the night in question‚Äù (para. 47).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par156" class="">156</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal therefore presents three issues:&nbsp; (1) does the ordinary meaning of ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù invariably lead the trier of fact to engage in reasoning prohibited by s. 276(1); (2) was the nature of their relationship relevant to any issue before the jury under s. 276(2)(b); and (3) should a new trial be ordered in the event the trial judge erred?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par157" class="">157</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These are difficult questions that go to the heart of s. 276. My view is that the trial judge applied the correct legal principles in her evidentiary ruling. The majority sees it differently, describing the ‚Äúclea[r] infect[ion]‚Äù of the context laid out before the jury with twin-myth reasoning, making the jury ‚Äúprivy to particulars‚Äù that it should not have known about (para. 72). While the majority reasons that this must have been caused by an error in the evidentiary ruling before trial, as I see it, the responsibility for any ‚Äúinfection‚Äù during this trial lies <i>not</i> in the trial judge‚Äôs ruling, but rather at the feet of the Crown, who must live with its choices.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par158" class="">158</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would answer the legal questions as follows. First, I say that evidence of a ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù relationship will, in certain cases, and without engaging in prohibited lines of reasoning, explain to a jury how two people know each other, consistent with how <i>other</i> relationships are presented to juries. I agree with the majority that relationship evidence, without proper scrutiny under s. 276 and sufficient limiting instructions, can trigger triers of fact to engage in prohibited lines of reasoning. But I do not accept the majority‚Äôs solution to this problem, which would treat evidence of certain relationships (for example, ‚Äúmarried‚Äù, ‚Äúdating‚Äù, or ‚Äúboyfriend-girlfriend‚Äù), each of which might also suggest previous sexual activity, differently in the s. 276 analysis based on how the particular relationship‚Äôs sexual features, real or imagined, are reasonably perceived. I prefer the trial judge‚Äôs evidentiary ruling, which treated the relationship between the appellant and the complainant consistently with other relationships in society. The jury could be told about the existence and nature of the relationship, but could not be told about its particularities or the frequency of sexual relations. The jury was then instructed <i>twice</i> on the permissible use of the evidence (to provide context for how the appellant and the complainant knew each other) and its impermissible uses (to suggest that, because they were friends with benefits, the complainant was more likely to consent on this occasion, or was less worthy of belief overall).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par159" class="">159</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the trial judge‚Äôs evidentiary ruling was consistent with the proposition that the existence of a relationship between the complainant and the accused may be admitted as relevant, but strictly where its absence would leave the trier of fact with a distorted representation of the circumstances surrounding the incident. The trial judge concluded this was such a circumstance. While the majority disagrees, and finds nothing in the appellant‚Äôs evidence that rendered his narrative ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù or ‚Äúutterly improbable‚Äù (para. 68) absent reference to the relationship, it is hard to find fault in the trial judge‚Äôs determination on this point when the Crown itself<i> </i>took a similar position ‚Äî specifically, that admitting evidence of the relationship was necessary to prevent distortion. The Crown‚Äôs objection was merely to the form, rather than the substance, of the appellant‚Äôs description of the relationship.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par160" class="">160</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded the trial judge committed an error in law sufficient to ground a Crown appeal from acquittal. This leads to my third point of departure from the majority. Ordering a new trial is unfair, given the following considerations: the Crown‚Äôs theory of the case against the appellant <i>drew directly from</i> the sexual nature of this relationship; the ‚Äúinfection‚Äù&nbsp; to which the majority refers was largely as a result of a contravention <i>by Crown counsel</i> of the terms of the trial judge‚Äôs evidentiary ruling; and, a successful Crown appeal from acquittal on this record inevitably lowers the bar which the Crown must overcome to show that a legal error had a material bearing on the acquittal so as to secure a new trial. How, after all, can the admission of this evidence be said to have had a material bearing on the acquittals, when the Crown was relying on <i>the selfsame evidence</i> to prove its case? The Crown was perfectly content in this case to refer, rely and ultimately weaponize the sexual past between the appellant and the complainant, until the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Only then did the Crown on appeal take the position that the sexual nature of the relationship must have led the jury to engage in prohibited reasoning ‚Äî and that, notwithstanding the Crown‚Äôs reliance on the <i>sexual nature</i> of that relationship, <i>the appellant</i> should not have been able to answer it. This is fundamentally unfair.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par161" class="">161</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These are the points that divide us. The jury rendered its verdict after being properly instructed on how to do so. I would allow the appeal and restore the acquittals.</p>

The Crown objected, saying that friends with benefits would trigger prohibited twin myth reasoning in the jury. It did agree, however, that the jury would need some context to dispel the notion that the appellant and the complainant were strangers. To be clear, the Crown‚Äôs objection was not to the injection of context, or, more broadly, to relationship evidence that insinuates past sexual activity, but to the term ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù. The Crown‚Äôs solution was to tell the jury that they dated for seven to eight months, broke up, then reconnected; and that, on occasion, the complainant would visit the appellant‚Äôs residence late in the evening and leave the following morning.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par163" class="">163</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I stress that it was the Crown‚Äôs position that it would not offend s. 276 or undermine the interests it is intended to protect for the jury to be told that the complainant would occasionally ‚Äúvisit‚Äù the appellant ‚Äî a former boyfriend with whom she had reconnected ‚Äî late in the evening, and that she would leave only the following morning.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par164" class="">164</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the competing positions. She directly addressed the prejudice that could flow to the complainant if the jury drew certain (prohibited) inferences from the nature of the relationship. She queried defence counsel during the <i>voir dire</i>: ‚Äúwhat is the safeguard then to prevent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one of the twin myths that because she consented to the [friends] with benefits relationship one, two, 10 or 20 times before that she is likely to have consented on this occasion. What is the protection if this evidence is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. permitted?‚Äù (A.R., vol. II, at p. 14).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par165" class="">165</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her evidentiary ruling, the trial judge agreed that without some context for how the appellant and the complainant knew each other, the appellant could not make full answer and defence. Bearing in mind that his credibility would be the central issue at trial, the jury could not properly assess (or indeed might well misconceive) the plausibility of his version of events were it prevented from understanding how the appellant and the complainant knew each other, or were it to simply assume they were strangers because no party had raised the issue of how they knew each other.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par166" class="">166</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admitting evidence of the relationship would be no different than admitting evidence that an accused and a complainant were ‚Äúmarried‚Äù, ‚Äúdating‚Äù, or ‚Äúboyfriend-girlfriend‚Äù. The point being, the trial judge believed the jury ought to be told how they knew each other in order to avoid misinterpreting things the appellant said or did as having arisen out of the blue (A.R., vol. I, at p. 6). As she viewed the matter, keeping the existence of the relationship from the jury would leave a level of ‚Äúartificiality‚Äù in the appellant‚Äôs evidence, and would prevent him from being able to make full answer and defence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par167" class="">167</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a thorough examination of the relevant factors under s. 276(2) and (3), the trial judge chose to admit the friends with benefits evidence, rather than the Crown‚Äôs proposed account of former lovers, who had reconnected to have adult sleepovers. As the majority notes, the trial judge remained very much alive to how a reference to the relationship could be misused to engage in prohibited lines of reasoning in relation to the complainant and her evidence. And she could not have been clearer in directing to the parties that, while evidence could be led about the relationship between the appellant and the complainant, <i>no</i> evidence was to be led about the relationship‚Äôs particularities (‚Äúthe specific sexual acts [the complainant] and the accused engaged in‚Äù), or frequency (‚Äúthe number of times they had sexual relations after they ceased living together‚Äù) (A.R., vol.&nbsp;I, at p. 10). And once again when, on the morning of trial, Crown counsel sought clarification about the scope of the evidentiary ruling, the trial judge reiterated that no evidence was to be led about particularities or frequency of the relationship.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;text-decoration:

Almost immediately after that, however, and still in chief, she testified that she and the appellant previously had sex in his bedroom. Crown counsel asked whether this occurred while they used to date, and the complainant answered that it occurred after they had broken up. Crown counsel then went one step further ‚Äî contrary to the trial judge‚Äôs clear and repeated instructions ‚Äî and asked whether they had sex on a single occasion or on ‚Äúvarious‚Äù occasions after they had broken up, and when was the last time she had sex with the appellant.

The legal question before us is, therefore, whether the trial judge erred in law because some legal principle precludes relationship evidence, namely ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù evidence, from being admitted in these circumstances. Any alleged errors reduce to this: either the trial judge erred, as the ordinary meaning of ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù invariably leads the jury to engage in prohibited reasoning under s. 276(1), or she erred because the evidence that they were ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù was simply not relevant to any issue at trial under s. 276(2)(b).</p>

But this is exactly what the majority finds: the obvious implication of friends with benefits is that the parties are in a relationship understandable <i>only</i> by reference to its sexual features. The evidence, then, is seen as denoting to the jury nothing more than a relationship characterized by (and <i>only</i> by) a repeated pattern of sexual activity; the allure of twin myth reasoning becomes irresistible.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par178" class="">178</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, I do not share this starting premise. While I agree that the jury <i>could</i> draw from prohibited lines of reasoning in these circumstances, the test for exclusion under s. 276(1) is not satisfied merely where a jury <i>could</i> draw such inferences. The risk that the jury might erroneously infer consent from evidence of the nature of a relationship is a realistic danger in <i>all</i> relationship evidence ‚Äî which, I note, the majority does not categorically exclude under s. 276(1). Rather, the test for exclusion under s. 276(1) is whether the evidence solely derives its relevance from prohibited lines of reasoning.&nbsp;</p>

But that is only part of the inquiry. The analyses under ss. 276(1) and 276(2) are not isolated from each other. Rather, they apply together since s. 276(2) creates a presumption of inadmissibility, making all evidence of the complainant‚Äôs sexual history inadmissible unless it is (a) of a sufficient specificity for the interests underlying s. 276 to be properly weighed, (b) relevant to an issue at trial that does not draw its relevance from prohibited lines of reasoning under s. 276(1),<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="color:windowtext;

Bar Rev.</i> 45, at p. 53). If the evidence cannot meet each of these statutory criteria under s. 276(2), it is inadmissible.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par180" class="">180</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In practice, therefore, the <i>voir dire</i> judge should determine whether the evidence is of specific instances of sexual activity, is relevant to an identifiable issue at trial that does not draw from prohibited lines of reasoning set out in s. 276(1), and has significant probative value that is not outweighed by substantial prejudice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par181" class="">181</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be clear, however, and to repeat: the test for exclusion under s. 276(1) is whether the evidence derives its relevance <i>solely</i> from twin myth reasoning. Section 276(1) does <i>not</i> operate to exclude evidence which merely ‚Äúengages‚Äù (majority reasons, at para. 42) twin myth reasoning. Were ‚Äúengagement‚Äù the test for categorical exclusion under s. 276(1), it would risk exclusion of <i>all</i> relationship evidence, or at least all evidence of relationships which also involve sexual activity, since that, too, would conceivably ‚Äúengage‚Äù twin myth reasoning. Rather, relationship evidence will typically be filtered via the inquiry contemplated by s. 276(2)(b), being whether, <i>in this case</i>, the relationship evidence is relevant to an identifiable issue at trial.&nbsp;</p>

But the Crown does not explain why evidence of the relationship which this term denotes is objectionable, while evidence of other relationships which regularly pass through the filter of s. 276(1), and yet which might also suggest previous sexual activity ‚Äî for example, ‚Äúmarried‚Äù, ‚Äúdating‚Äù, or ‚Äúboyfriend-girlfriend‚Äù, or, for that matter, the Crown‚Äôs preferred relationship description in this case of former lovers who enjoy adult sleepovers ‚Äî is not.</p>

And, in any event, she made the jury aware of the permissible purpose for which the evidence of <i>this</i> relationship was admitted (to explain how the appellant and the complainant knew each other), and of the impermissible inferences they could <i>not</i> draw from its use in popular imagination.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par184" class="">184</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that the foundation of the majority‚Äôs test for admitting relationship evidence under s. 276(1) is that some relationships have aspects which transcend sexual intimacy, while other relationships (which also involve sexual activity) can be understood only through the lens of that sexual activity. The majority reduces the relationship in this case to its most carnal features, and leaves it to trial judges, moving forward, to determine whether the sexual features, real or imagined, of the particular relationship term before them would likely be used to engage in prohibited lines of reasoning. But, and I say this respectfully, this posture is unprincipled and rests on assumptions about relationships that I do not share. At the risk of stating the obvious, even relationships that involve sexual activity, but which lack the expectation or even desire of a more formal relationship such as marriage or common law partnership, can be about much more than the sexual activity. At the very least, evidence of such relationships will give important context to the non-sexual interactions between the parties to the relationship, which may be (as it is here) necessary to making full answer and defence.</p>

Instead, we are left only with the undesirable effect of the majority‚Äôs reasons, being their creation of legally significant distinctions in this area of law between the ‚Äúright‚Äù kind of relationship with sexual aspects (i.e., monogamous and stable) and the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù kind of relationship with sexual aspects (friends with benefits, i.e., casual or occasional) (see U. Khan, ‚ÄúHot for Kink, Bothered by the Law: BDSM and the Right to Autonomy‚Äù (Summer 2006), 41:2 <i>Law Matters </i>17; L. A. Rosenbury, ‚ÄúFriends with Benefits?‚Äù (2007), 106 <i>Mich. L.

Craig, ‚ÄúCapacity to Consent to Sexual Risk‚Äù (2014), 17 <i>New Crim. L. Rev.</i> 103; J. Sealy-Harrington, ‚ÄúTied Hands?

The majority may not find it troubling to privilege, in a way that goes to the heart of the ability to make full answer and defence, certain kinds of relationships over others, but I do, and I respectfully decline to follow my colleagues through this moral thicket.</p>

Grant</i>, 2015 SCC 9, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 475, at para. 19) and resurrects the approach to evidence ‚Äî specifically, of creating pre-determined categories of admissibility ‚Äî which this Court rejected in <i>Seaboyer</i>. And finally, this approach downplays the text and purpose of statutory provisions like s. 276.4, which recognizes that evidence may be admissible for certain purposes yet inadmissible for other purposes, and makes a limiting instruction <i>mandatory</i> where any evidence of other sexual activity is introduced, even if it only refers to other sexual activity indirectly or implicitly, to cure prejudice and to warn the jury of the impermissible uses of that evidence.</p>

The jury was instructed <i>twice</i> on the permissible use of the evidence (to provide context for how the appellant and the complainant knew each other) and its impermissible uses (to suggest that, because they were friends with benefits, the complainant was more likely to consent on this occasion, or was less worthy of belief overall).

On this basis, the majority finds the trial judge‚Äôs determination that the nature of the relationship was relevant to the appellant‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence to constitute reversible error.</p>

Section 276(2)‚Äôs evidentiary filter recognizes the relevance of evidence of a relationship between the complainant and the accused and therefore allows it to be admitted, but only where its absence would prevent the accused from making full answer and defence, by leaving the trier of fact with a distorted representation of the circumstances surrounding the incident (see <i>R. v. Harris</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 498 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. M.&nbsp;(M.) </i>(1999), 29 C.R. (5th) 85 (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v. Temertzoglou</i> (2002), 11 C.R. (6th) 179 (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v.

(7th) 1; see also Craig, ‚ÄúSection 276 Misconstrued‚Äù, at p.&nbsp;75). The trial judge concluded this was such a circumstance. And, I repeat: <i>the Crown was substantially of the same view</i>. Its objection was <i>not</i> to <i>the admissibility</i> of evidence of the relationship, but to <i>the label</i>. Indeed, the Crown‚Äôs position has remained consistent that the nature of the relationship is <i>not</i> in dispute (A.R., vol. II, at p. 40; R.F.C.A., at para. 6; R.F., at para. 8):&nbsp; a former relationship ‚Äî now a friendship ‚Äî that, from time to time, involves sexual activity.</p>

Silver, ‚ÄúThe <i>WD</i> Revolution‚Äù (2018), 41 <i>Man. L.J.</i> 307), since it went to this accused‚Äôs capacity to raise a reasonable doubt on the strength of his own evidence. It is difficult to conceive of evidence of greater probative value than evidence that is essential to an accused‚Äôs ability to make full answer and defence. This is particularly so where, as here, the evidence of the complainant and the accused are diametrically opposed in every material respect, leaving credibility the most important issue at trial (<i>R. v. Crosby</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 912, at para. 12, per <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">L‚ÄôHeureux‚ÄëDub√© </span>J.; see also <i>R. v. Nyznik</i>, 2017 ONSC 4392, 40 C.R.

To deny the appellant the ability to point to his relationship would in these circumstances disable the jury from meaningfully performing its central function of finding facts and seeking out the truth. How else, for example, could the jury properly assess his explanation for why he went over to the complainant‚Äôs residence to pick her up that evening (he owed her ‚Äúbirthday sex‚Äù)? Or his mouthing, unprompted, at her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck you‚Äù in the presence of his roommate? Or their bickering about which side of the bed she would sleep on to avoid ‚Äúhot flashes‚Äù? Or his knowledge of her hot flashes? Or that the hot flashes occurred when she was on a certain side of his bed?</p>

More particularly, without this evidence, his actions (including his words and gestures) will have appeared to have arisen out of nowhere, creating a completely misleading impression on the jury. His right to make full answer and defence would be reduced to painting a picture of himself as (at best) crude and reckless, or (at worst) predatory.</p>

But it is far from clear that this is an improvement over ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù, and indeed in my view it would appear more likely to invite prurient and speculative inferences. And, as Berger J.A. noted in his dissent in the court below, the Crown‚Äôs language would not have been necessarily accompanied by either of the <i>two </i>limiting instructions the trial judge gave at this trial. The jury‚Äôs collective mind would truly be left to wander. Instead, the trial judge concluded that allowing the jury to hear about the existence of a relationship, without hearing evidence about its particularities or frequency, prevented the appellant‚Äôs evidence from being considered through a distorted lens and ensured the appellant‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence was preserved. I find nothing in the trial judge‚Äôs relevance assessment that constitutes reversible error.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par196" class="">196</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My third point of departure relates to fairness. I observe that it was <i>the Crown‚Äôs</i> cross-examination of the appellant which directly put the <i>sexual </i>nature of his relationship with the complainant at issue. And it was <i>the Crown</i> who suggested that he had sexually assaulted her because they hadn‚Äôt had sex recently. And it was <i>the Crown</i> who suggested that they had a ‚Äútumultuous relationship‚Äù marked <span style="line-height:200%">with many arguments and her being upset with him but returning to him eventually. </span><i>The difference</i>, however, is that the Crown leaned into the existence of the relationship in order to advance a theory that, <i>because</i> they were in a sexual relationship, the jury should find that he expected sex and was angry when she refused. At the same time, however, the Crown insisted that the appellant be prohibited from rebutting that theory, if his evidence would in any way indirectly reveal to the jury that the complainant had engaged in <i>the same sexual activity that the Crown pointed to in support of its own theory</i>. This is, as I have already observed, fundamentally unfair.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par197" class="">197</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What also strikes me as fundamentally unfair is the majority‚Äôs characterization of the effects of the evidentiary ruling, in particular because the evidentiary ruling would <u>not</u> have revealed any direct evidence of other sexual activity (which is a critical consideration in the balancing mandated by s. 276), had not <i>the Crown </i>chosen to pursue a line of questioning that directly contravened it. The ruling, it must be remembered, should have had the effect of only indirectly or incidentally revealing the complainant‚Äôs other sexual activity, because no evidence could be elicited about ‚Äúthe specific sexual acts [the complainant] and the accused engaged in‚Äù, or ‚Äúthe number of times they had sexual relations after they ceased living together‚Äù (A.R., vol. I, at p. 10). The s. 276 regime recognizes that differing degrees of prejudice will flow from certain types of sexual history evidence over others. A trial judge assesses the extent to which sexual history evidence will risk leading the jury <i>in this case</i> to draw prohibited inferences. This is a core feature of the discretion afforded to trial judges by s. 276 (<i>R. v. Darrach</i>, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, at paras. 19, 30, 36 and 71).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par198" class="">198</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority provides a helpful guide for trial judges on the exercise of discretion (paras. 74-75): where a trial judge is concerned about the jury improperly speculating on past sexual activity, the trial judge should clearly explain to the jury that they will not hear any evidence about whether the relationship included a sexual aspect; the jury must be instructed that no means no and that consent in the past in no way implies or assumes consent in the future; and if relationship evidence is admissible, it should be adduced through an agreed statement of facts, to minimize the need for examination and cross-examination.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par199" class="">199</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And yet, each of these principles was observed by the trial judge in her evidentiary ruling, her conversations with counsel, her cautions to the jury, and her final instructions. It was <i>the Crown‚Äôs</i> decision not to adduce this evidence through an agreed statement of facts (as suggested by the trial judge) and <i>the Crown‚Äôs</i> later contravention of the evidentiary ruling (which had the effect of introducing otherwise inadmissible evidence before the jury), that caused the problems at trial which the majority now, remarkably, lays at the feet of <i>the trial judge</i>. This strikes me as a wholly unacceptable basis for a successful <i>Crown</i> appeal from an acquittal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par200" class="">200</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Crown counsel‚Äôs caution in seeking clarification of the ruling (which is to be commended) did not prevent a contravention of that same ruling is demonstrative of a problem of application arising from the delicate balancing mandated by s. 276 (see D. Stuart, ‚ÄúTwin Myth Hypotheses in Rape Shield Laws are Too Rigid and <i>Darrach</i> is Unclear‚Äù (2009), 64 C.R. (6th) 74, at pp. 75-76). What is agreed to in advance can go off the rails when the witness takes the stand. The majority identifies this as such a case, but then resolves the problem of application in favour of the Crown. This is unfortunate, because the trial judge‚Äôs evidentiary ruling, as well as her numerous interventions in the trial, were faithful to (and not a departure from) the principles articulated in <i>Seaboyer</i> and <i>Darrach</i>. She applied the correct legal principles: such relationship evidence will be relevant where the accused would otherwise be prevented from making full answer and defence, and the features of the evidence only indirectly or incidentally reveal the complainant‚Äôs other sexual activity. In such a circumstance, full answer and defence cannot be achieved by confining accused persons to saying what happened and not allowing them to explain how, or why, or to produce any corroborating evidence. The significant probative value of such evidence would outweigh any prejudicial effect (particularly when accompanied, as it was here, by an appropriate limiting instruction), and the proper balance under s. 276 would be struck.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par201" class="">201</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the majority‚Äôs approach relieves the Crown of its high burden of demonstrating that a legal error had a material bearing on the jury‚Äôs verdict (see <i>R. v. Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609). While the majority reasons that the relationship evidence tendered in this case would have had a material bearing on the acquittals, this does not account for the fact that the relationship evidence was relied on <i>by the Crown</i> against the appellant. And again, it was <i>the Crown</i>, and not the appellant, who contravened the evidentiary ruling and explored both the details (the location of previous sexual activity), and the frequency of the sexual activity.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par202" class="">202</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Watt J.A. observed in <i>R. v. Luciano</i>, 2011 ONCA 89, 273 O.A.C. 273:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worth reminder that the appeal of the Attorney General is from the <i>acquittal</i>, not the admissibility ruling that is said to constitute an error in law. What is required is a demonstration of a legal error (in the admissibility ruling) and a nexus between the legal error and the verdict rendered (an acquittal).&nbsp; The authorities teach that acquittals are not to be overturned lightly. [Emphasis in original; para. 260.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN">Here, the Crown has not established a sufficient nexus between the legal error and the verdict rendered. Again, I ask, how can the admission of this evidence be said to have had a material bearing on the acquittals, when <i>the Crown</i> was relying on the selfsame evidence to prove its case? The <i>Graveline</i> standard is not met on this record. I say respectfully that the majority‚Äôs position undesirably waters down the <i>Graveline</i> standard in remitting this matter for a new trial.</p>
 <p class="Title1LevelTitre1Niveau-AltL"><span style="text-decoration:
none">XI.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conclusion</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par203" class="">203</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, I agree with the trial judge‚Äôs chain of reasoning under s. 276. Making full answer and defence includes being allowed to tell a story that is complete and coherent by drawing from relevant evidence whose probative value outweighs its prejudicial effects. This cannot be achieved by confining accused persons to saying what happened and not allowing them to explain how, or why, or to produce any corroborating evidence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par204" class="">204</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognizing this, the trial judge in my view deftly managed a circumstance made difficult not only by the subject matter of the evidence, but by the Crown having exceeded the scope of the evidentiary ruling in her examination of the complainant. Her decision to admit this highly probative evidence for the limited purpose of allowing jurors to assess the plausibility of the appellant‚Äôs account of what happened was faithful to <i>Seaboyer</i> (at p. 609) and to s. 276. And, her careful instruction to the jury regarding that limited purpose was sufficient to address any prejudicial effect arising. Jurors are ‚Äú[not] morons, completely devoid of intelligence‚Äù, but are ‚Äúconscientious‚Äù, ‚Äúanxious to perform their duties‚Äù, and would not ‚Äúbe forgetful of instructions‚Äù (<i>W.(D.)</i>, at p.&nbsp;761, per Cory J., citing <i>R. v. Lane and Ross</i> <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">(1969), 6 C.R.N.S. 273 (Ont. S.C.) (emphasis deleted); </span>see also <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 695-96, per Dickson C.J.).</p>

I would allow the appeal and restore the acquittals.</p>
