 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule against oath‚Äëhelping prohibits a party from presenting evidence solely for the purpose of bolstering a witness' credibility before that witness' credibility is attacked.&nbsp; This type of evidence tends to prove the truthfulness of the witness, rather than the truth of the witness' statements.&nbsp; The testimony at issue made no reference to the truthfulness or good character of the complainant, or of themselves.&nbsp; Their evidence was rather corroborative of an issue in the trial that was raised in the complainant's testimony ‚Äë‚Äë the system of violent domination that the appellant used to control the members of the household.&nbsp; While the impugned testimony shored up the complainant's credibility by implication, it was not called solely or even primarily for that purpose.&nbsp; It was not, therefore, oath‚Äëhelping evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trial judges must properly instruct juries as to the use that they can make of evidence which is highly prejudicial to an accused in relation to the accused's character.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge did not charge the jury with respect to the use they could make of this testimony.&nbsp; The judge was required to explain clearly in the instructions to the jurors that they must not infer from the evidence that tended to show the appellant's bad character that the appellant was guilty because he is the sort of person who is likely to commit the offences in question.&nbsp; The prejudicial effect of the impugned testimony was high enough that lack of proper instruction may have resulted in unfair guilty verdicts.&nbsp; The trial judge's caution to the jury that they could not use a conviction on one count before them as evidence of propensity to commit the other counts and that they could only make limited use of the evidence of the appellant's prior convictions did not cure the charge of its faults.&nbsp; Finally, no connection exists between the degree of relevancy of the evidence and the need for instructions as to the use that could be made of the testimony since highly relevant evidence could still be extremely prejudicial to the accused and be misused by the jury in reaching their verdict.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, at p.&nbsp;855, "[t]he errors alleged lose their significance in the face of this inevitable conclusion."&nbsp; I would reiterate my observation in <i>R. v. Nygaard</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1074, that where the result of a re‚Äëtrial will necessarily be the same, a new trial is not in the best interests of the administration of justice.&nbsp; No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case.&nbsp; The result of a re‚Äëtrial would necessarily be the same, and it cannot be said that the accused has been deprived of his right to a fair trial.&nbsp; It is thus just and appropriate for this Court to apply the curative provisions of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>

(which Chipman J.A. described as "almost incredible") and to why she had waited so long before making a complaint to the police.&nbsp; Both P.A.L.'s credibility and the long delay in coming forward were put in issue at trial by the appellant.&nbsp; Chipman J.A. also held at p.&nbsp;251 that there was "a degree of distinctiveness, uniqueness and striking similarity between the evidence relating to abuse of the siblings and the abuse which underlies the offences charged against the appellant."</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">This theme was repeated during counsel's closing remarks.&nbsp; Counsel for the appellant also emphasized throughout the trial that the complainant's mother was abusive towards her children and might be the party actually responsible for the complainant's physical injuries.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

D. (L.E.)</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111, this Court directed that a new trial be held where the trial judge had not charged the jury properly with respect to the use they could make of evidence admitted as an exception to the bad character evidence exclusionary rule.&nbsp; Sopinka J. wrote for the majority that the trial judge's instruction to the jury is necessary to counteract three possible effects of the evidence on the jury:&nbsp; that the jury might convict based on propensity, that the jury might convict to punish for past acts, and that the jury might become confused and substitute a verdict with respect to the past acts for a verdict on the charges in issue.&nbsp; In light of the seriousness of these possible consequences, Sopinka J. held at p.&nbsp;128:</span></p>

D. (L.E.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, partially on the ground that the trial judge did not adequately instruct the jury with respect to the limited use they could make of evidence tending to show the accused's bad character, there is no support for the respondent's argument that lack of proper instruction is not a reversible error of law and not ground for a new trial.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same question may be asked in the context of whether the jury in the instant case could have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt had they been properly charged with respect to how they might use the testimony of L.L. and T.B.&nbsp; In my opinion, the evidence was not so overwhelming that the jury would have inevitably convicted the appellant if the judge had properly instructed them as to the use they could make of that testimony.&nbsp; Credibility was a large issue at trial, and it is impossible to know what was in the minds of the jurors and how they were affected by the unrestricted admission of the evidence in question.&nbsp; The assessment of whether to apply the curative provision of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is complicated by the fact that there were multiple charges which involved included offences, with the result that a properly instructed jury might have convicted but not on all the charges or for different offences.&nbsp; In summary, this is not an appropriate case to invoke the curative provision in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence of L.L. and T.B. was admissible because it was relevant to several serious issues in the case such as the defence of innocent association, the system of violent control that the appellant exercised over the family which would explain why the abuse was allowed to occur and why the complainant was too frightened to press charges until much later, and the suggestion that Mrs. L. was responsible for the complainant's physical injuries.&nbsp; In my view, the probative value of the testimony of L.L. and T.B. is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect and the evidence was properly admitted.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
