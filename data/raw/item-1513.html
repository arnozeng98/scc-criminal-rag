The Crown psychiatrist testified that the accused was an obsessed and extremely temperamental “sexual deviate” who had a “biological anomaly in the wiring of his brain”, and that, as such, he was “a very dangerous person to society”. The defence psychiatrist&nbsp; acknowledged the profound nature of the accused’s sexual problems but concluded that he had shown change toward less violent behaviour and did not “find him particularly dangerous at the present time”.&nbsp; The trial judge preferred the evidence of the Crown psychiatrist and found that the accused was a dangerous offender.&nbsp; On the subject of the predicate offences, the trial judge endorsed the Crown psychiatrist’s conclusion that although they “may appear less serious” than the accused’s previous sexual offences “from an assaultive aspect, they are more blatant, indicating a lessening of control on the part” of the accused.&nbsp; On the issue of sentencing, the trial judge alluded to the fact that, under s.&nbsp;761(1) of the <i>Code</i>, the National Parole Board is statutorily required to review the dangerous offender designation intermittently.&nbsp; He then exercised his statutory discretion and imposed an indeterminate sentence.&nbsp; On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had wrongfully declared the accused a dangerous offender,&nbsp; mainly because it found that the trial judge “failed to consider the gravity of the predicate offences in isolation from his previous offences”.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The accused was properly designated a dangerous offender and correctly sentenced to an indeterminate period of incarceration.&nbsp; Under s.&nbsp;753(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Code</i>, there are two thresholds that the Crown must surpass in order for a dangerous offender application to be successful:&nbsp; first, the Crown must establish that the offender has been convicted of a “serious personal injury offence”, which is defined in s.&nbsp;752(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Code</i> to include all forms of sexual assault; and second,&nbsp; the trial judge must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a “likelihood” that the offender will cause “injury, pain or other evil to other persons through [his] failure in the future to control his sexual impulses”.&nbsp; Given the language,&nbsp; nature and structure of s.&nbsp;753(<i>b</i>), a trial judge need not focus on the objective seriousness of a predicate offence in order to conclude that a dangerous offender designation is warranted.&nbsp; The prospective dangerousness of the offender in s.&nbsp;753(<i>b</i>) is measured by reference to “his conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for which he has been convicted”.&nbsp; “[A]ny sexual matter” can refer to the predicate offence, but it need not. As long as the offender’s past conduct in any sexual matter demonstrates a present likelihood of inflicting future harm upon others, the dangerous offender designation is justified.&nbsp; Further, in enacting s.&nbsp;753(<i>b</i>), Parliament has indicated that certain types of offence, which are inherently serious, can trigger a dangerous offender application, and sexual assault ‑‑ whatever form it may take ‑‑ is one of them.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The dangerous offender designation was reasonably supported by the evidence.&nbsp; The accused’s pattern of criminal sexual behaviour and the psychiatric evidence of the Crown psychiatrist, which was accepted by the trial judge, were sufficient proof to justify such a conclusion.&nbsp; While it was open to the trial judge to prefer the evidence of the Crown psychiatrist to that of the defence psychiatrist, it was not similarly open to the Court of Appeal to re‑evaluate the psychiatric evidence and overturn the dangerous offender designation because of a mere difference of opinion. A finding of dangerousness by a trial judge is a finding of fact, frequently based on the competing credibility of experts, and as long as it is reasonable, it is a finding which should not be lightly overturned.&nbsp; The role of an appellate court is to determine if the dangerous offender designation was reasonable.&nbsp; Section 759 of the<i> Code</i> cannot be interpreted as calling for the equivalent of a trial <i>de novo</i> on the dangerous offender application.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some deference to the findings of a trial judge is warranted. The trial judge’s findings were reasonable and, absent an error of law, his designation should stand.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The trial judge’s conclusions were not based on errors of law.&nbsp; He did not misconstrue the burden of proof in dangerous offender proceedings when he stated that the accused’s submissions “failed to persuade” him.&nbsp; When this passage is read in its entire context, it is obvious that the trial judge was really indicating that the accused’s submissions had failed to disturb his findings as regards the accused’s dangerousness.&nbsp; Finally, the trial judge’s reference to the National Parole Board’s intermittent power of review under s.&nbsp;761(1) of the <i>Code</i> was not an abdication of responsibility.&nbsp; It was a judicial reminder that, although it may be indeterminate, the accused’s sentence need not be permanent.</span></p>

McCraw</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at p. 83, sexual assault, whatever form it may take, is one of them.&nbsp; Other offences, presumably less threatening to the personal safety of others, do not trigger s. 753.&nbsp;</p>

The Court upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, principally on the basis that a dangerous offender is not being sentenced for past or even future criminality.&nbsp; As La Forest J. indicated at p. 328:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">The individual is clearly being sentenced for the “serious personal injury offence” he or she has been found guilty of committing, albeit in a different way than would ordinarily be done.&nbsp; It must be remembered that the appellant was not picked up off the street because of his past criminality (for which he has already been punished), or because of fears or suspicions about his criminal proclivities, and then subjected to a procedure in order to determine whether society would be better off if he were incarcerated indefinitely.&nbsp; Rather he was arrested and prosecuted for a very serious violent crime and subjected to a procedure aimed at determining the appropriate penalty that should be inflicted upon him in the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

In fact, while specifically aimed at providing the constitutional justification for s. 753 (then s. 688),&nbsp; the above passage from <i>Lyons</i> serves to underline the very point of this case -- that “serious personal injury offences” are inherently serious and there is thus no need to think that the offender is being punished for his “past criminality”.&nbsp;&nbsp; As in <i>Lyons</i>, there is nothing in this case that suggests the respondent has been “picked up off the street”.&nbsp; Nor is there any more reason here than there was in <i>Lyons</i> to suggest that he is being punished for anything other than the predicate offences.</p>

C.A.), correctly held that s. 759 does not give appellate courts an explicit jurisdiction to overturn a dangerous offender designation, the facts upon which a dangerousness finding are based are necessarily relevant to determining whether an indeterminate sentence should be quashed.&nbsp; Hence the finding of dangerousness is properly before an appellate court.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The Court cannot forget that s. 753(<i>b</i>) does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent will re-offend.&nbsp; Such a standard would be impossible to meet.&nbsp; Instead, s. 753(<i>b</i>) requires that the court be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a “likelihood” that the respondent will inflict harm, and the trial judge took explicit notice of this, citing <i>R. v. Knight</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 343 (Ont. H.C.); <i>R. v. Dwyer</i> (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 293 (Alta. C.A.); <i>R. v. Carleton</i> (1981), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (Alta. C.A.) (aff’d [1983] 2 S.C.R. 58).&nbsp; See also <i>Langevin</i>, <i>supra.</i>&nbsp; I am thus unwilling to conclude, on the basis of a few misplaced words, that the trial judge either misunderstood or misapplied the burden of proof on this dangerous offender application.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">I must therefore sentence Mr. Currie to an indeterminate period in the penitentiary and leave to the evaluation by experts in the National Parole Board and in the penitentiary system the status of Mr. Currie’s treatment and his right to re-enter society.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">While it is important to recognize that an indeterminate sentence does not automatically follow a dangerous offender designation, I do not interpret Tobias J.’s reference to the National Parole Board’s intermittent power of review as an abdication of responsibility.&nbsp; Instead, I view it as a judicial reminder that, although it may be indeterminate, Robert Currie’s sentence need not be permanent.</p>
