The trial judge found that G was not competent for the Crown, owing to the common law rule of spousal incompetence.&nbsp; Following the ruling on the motion, the Crown decided that it would not offer any evidence in support of a conviction.&nbsp; Accordingly, the jury rendered directed acquittals of the two accused.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed that the witness was not competent for the Crown, but held that the evidence could have been admitted pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec715" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;715<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> or alternatively under the principled exception to the hearsay rule developed in <i>Khan</i>, <i>Smith</i> and <i>B.

Venner</i>, [1970] S.C.R. 608; <i>Watkins v.

K.B.).&nbsp; The Nova Scotia Supreme Court in <i>Snelgrove</i> defended this interpretation on two separate grounds: first, the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> was generally intended to be a comprehensive criminal statute; second, the predecessor of s. 8(3) of the <i>Code</i> (continuing common law justifications and excuses) implicitly excluded other rules of common law.&nbsp; Professor Schiff, however, suggests that the exhaustiveness of s. 715 remains an open question: <i>Evidence in the Litigation Process</i> (4th ed. 1993), at pp. 431-32, nn. 13-14.&nbsp; See, as well, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>, at p. 274, n. 420.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">. . . <i>Khan</i> should not be understood as turning on its particular facts, but, instead, must be seen as a particular expression of the fundamental principles that underlie the hearsay rule and the exceptions to it.&nbsp; What is important, in my view, is the departure signalled by <i>Khan</i> from a view of hearsay characterized by a general prohibition on the reception of such evidence, subject to a limited number of defined categorical exceptions, and a movement towards an approach governed by the principles which underlie the rule and its exceptions alike.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

Venner</i>, <i>supra</i> (business records exception).&nbsp; In our view, this limited danger is more than compensated by the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness inherent in the adversarial, adjudicative process of a preliminary inquiry.&nbsp; A declarant's statements before an inquiry are given under oath or affirmation before the adverse party, and the accuracy of the statement is certified by a written transcript which is signed by the judge.&nbsp; Most importantly, the statement is subject to contemporaneous cross-examination and, as Arbour J.A. noted, the party against whom the hearsay evidence is tendered has the power, at trial, to call the witness whose out-of-court statement is being offered.&nbsp; Indeed, it is difficult to imagine more reliable circumstances for a declarant to utter an out-of-court statement which is then tendered into evidence.</p>

(K.G.)</i> and <i>U.

The admission of the transcripts at trial would not undermine the established protection of the spousal incompetency rule.&nbsp; The rule serves to protect the appellant’s dual interests in preserving his marital harmony and in avoiding the “natural repugnance” of having his spouse testify against him in the course of the marriage.&nbsp; But neither of those interests is threatened in this instance.&nbsp; </span></p>

L. Rev.</i>&nbsp;519, at p. 555.&nbsp; An analysis of the theoretical disruption of an accused’s marriage on a case-by-case basis is simply an inadequate manner to proceed with this problem.&nbsp; </span></p>

For example, here, the Crown legally obtained evidence from a witness, in the form of&nbsp; testimony at a preliminary inquiry.&nbsp; Because of the spousal incompetence rule, the Crown was precluded from calling this witness at trial.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the statement still existed as evidence in a tangible form, and an attempt was then made to introduce it.&nbsp; While, generally, statements of this sort cannot be led at trial because of the hearsay rule, it is not so where the evidence fits into a recognized exception.&nbsp; This is a proper manner of adducing evidence, and if the preliminary inquiry testimony is not prohibited by the hearsay rule, it should be admitted unless some other rule of evidence prevents this route.</span></p>

Similarly, if the spouse and the accused were to be regarded as “one” person, it would have been unfair to compel testimony from this “unit” in order to convict one of its component members.&nbsp; Both of&nbsp; these thoroughly discredited rationales today are, of course, based on archaic notions of a woman’s role in society and within the marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they continued to exist today, however, and were justifiable, I would have no difficulty concluding that out-of-court statements could not be admitted at trial.&nbsp; The logic would clearly extend to the situation before us.&nbsp; Of course, given that the rationales themselves are not soundly based, we no longer recognize or rely upon them.</span></p>

United States</i>, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), the United States Supreme Court&nbsp; modified the common law rule on spousal incompetence to give the witness-spouse, rather than the accused spouse, control over whether they would give testimony in a case where their spouse is the accused.&nbsp; This was done by modifying the common law, and not overriding a statute like <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec4" target="_blank">s. 4<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; I have already agreed with my colleagues that we should not modify the rule of spousal incompetence.&nbsp; Nor should we avoid that rule by the use of a hearsay exception.</span></p>
