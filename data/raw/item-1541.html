text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">In Alberta, three accused in separate and unrelated criminal proceedings in Provincial Court challenged the constitutionality of their trials. They each brought a motion before the Court of Queen’s Bench, arguing that, as a result of the salary reduction of the Provincial Court judges pursuant to the <i>Payment to Provincial Judges Amendment Regulation</i> and s.&nbsp;17(1) of the <i>Provincial Court Judges Act</i>, the Provincial Court was not an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of s.&nbsp;11(<i>d</i>).&nbsp; The accused also challenged the constitutionality of the Attorney General’s power to designate the court’s sitting days and judges’ place of residence.&nbsp; The accused&nbsp; requested various remedies, including prohibition and declaratory orders.&nbsp; The superior court&nbsp; judge found that the salary reduction of the Provincial Court judges was unconstitutional because it was not part of an overall economic measure ‑‑ an exception he narrowly defined.&nbsp; He did not find s.&nbsp;17 of the <i>Provincial Court Judges Act</i>, however, to be unconstitutional. On his own initiative, the superior court judge considered the constitutionality of the process for disciplining Provincial Court judges and the grounds for their removal and concluded that ss.&nbsp;11(1)(b), 11(1)(c) and 11(2) of the <i>Provincial Court Judges Act</i> violated s.&nbsp;11(<i>d</i>) because they failed to adequately protect security of tenure.&nbsp; The superior court judge also found that ss.&nbsp;13(1)(a) and 13(1)(b) of that Act, which permit the Attorney General to designate the judges’ place of residence and the court’s sitting days, violated s.&nbsp;11(<i>d</i>).&nbsp; In the end, the superior court judge declared the provincial legislation and regulations which were the source of the s.&nbsp;11(<i>d</i>) violations to be of no force or effect, thus rendering the Provincial Court independent.&nbsp; As a result, although the Crown lost on the constitutional issue,&nbsp; it was successful in its efforts to commence or continue the trials of the accused.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeals, holding that it did not have jurisdiction under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec784subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;784(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> to hear them because the Crown was “successful” at trial and therefore could not rely on s.&nbsp;784(1), and because declaratory relief is non‑prohibitory and is therefore beyond the ambit of s.&nbsp;784(1).</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Financial security has both an individual and an institutional dimension.&nbsp; The institutional dimension of financial security has three components.&nbsp; First, as a general constitutional principle, the salaries of provincial court judges can be reduced, increased, or frozen, either as part of an overall economic measure which affects the salaries of all or some persons who are remunerated from public funds, or as part of a measure which is directed at provincial court judges as a class.&nbsp; However, to avoid the possibility of, or the appearance of, political interference through economic manipulation, a body, such as a commission, must be interposed between the judiciary and the other branches of government.&nbsp; The constitutional function of this body would be to depoliticize the process of determining changes to or freezes in judicial remuneration.&nbsp; This objective would be achieved by setting that body the specific task of issuing a report on the salaries and benefits of judges to the executive and the legislature.&nbsp; Provinces are thus under a constitutional obligation to establish bodies which are independent, effective and objective.&nbsp; Any changes to or freezes in judicial remuneration made without prior recourse to the body are unconstitutional. &nbsp;Although&nbsp; the recommendations of the body are non‑binding they should not be set aside lightly.&nbsp; If the executive or legislature chooses to depart from them, it has to justify its decision according to a standard of simple rationality -- if need be, in a court of law.&nbsp; Across‑the‑board measures which affect substantially every person who is paid from the public purse are <i>prima facie</i> rational, whereas a measure directed at judges alone may require a somewhat fuller explanation.&nbsp; Second, under no circumstances is it permissible for the judiciary ‑‑ not only collectively through representative organizations, but also as individuals ‑‑ to engage in negotiations over remuneration with the executive or representatives of the legislature.&nbsp; Any such negotiations would be fundamentally at odds with judicial independence.&nbsp; That does not preclude chief justices or judges, or bodies representing judges, however, from expressing concerns or making representations to governments regarding judicial remuneration. Third, any reductions to judicial remuneration cannot take those salaries below a basic minimum level of remuneration which is required for the office of a judge.&nbsp; Public confidence in the independence of the judiciary would be undermined if judges were paid at such a low rate that they could be perceived as susceptible to political pressure through economic manipulation.&nbsp; In order to guard against the possibility that government inaction could be used as a means of economic manipulation, by allowing judges’ real salaries to fall because of inflation, and in order to protect against the possibility that judicial salaries will fall below the adequate minimum guaranteed by judicial independence, the body must convene if a fixed period of time has elapsed since its last report, in order to consider the adequacy of judges’ salaries in light of the cost of living and other relevant factors.&nbsp; The components of the institutional dimension of financial security need not be adhered to in cases of dire and exceptional financial emergency precipitated by unusual circumstances.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Finally, the Manitoba government infringed the administrative independence of the Provincial Court by closing it on a number of days.&nbsp; It was the executive, in ordering the withdrawal of court staff, pursuant to s.&nbsp;4 of Bill 22, several days before the Chief Judge announced the closing of the Provincial Court, that shut down the court.&nbsp; Section 4 is therefore unconstitutional. &nbsp;Even if the trial judge had been right to conclude that the Chief Judge retained control over the decision to close the Provincial Court throughout, there would nevertheless have been a violation of s.&nbsp;11(<i>d</i>), because the Chief Judge would have exceeded her constitutional authority when she made that decision.&nbsp; Control over the sittings of the court falls within the administrative independence of the judiciary.&nbsp; Administrative independence is a characteristic of judicial independence which generally has a collective or institutional dimension.&nbsp; Although certain decisions may be exercised on behalf of the judiciary by the Chief Judge, important decisions regarding administrative independence cannot be made by the Chief Judge alone.&nbsp; The decision to close the Provincial Court was precisely this kind of decision. Manitoba has attempted to justify the closure of the Provincial Court solely on the basis of financial considerations, and for that reason, the closure of the court cannot be justified under s.&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Although reading down s.&nbsp;4 of Bill 22 to the extent strictly necessary would be the normal solution in a case like this, this is difficult in relation to violations of s.&nbsp;11(<i>d</i>) because, unlike other <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>provisions, s.&nbsp;11(<i>d</i>) requires that judicial independence be secured by “objective conditions or guarantees”.&nbsp; To read down s.&nbsp;4 to its proper scope would in effect amount to reading in those objective conditions and guarantees.&nbsp; This would result in a fundamental rewriting of the legislation.&nbsp; If the Court, however, were to strike down s.&nbsp;4 in its entirety, the effect would be to prevent its application to all those employees of the Government of Manitoba who were required to take leave without pay.&nbsp; The best solution in the circumstances is to read <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec4subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;4(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> as exempting provincial court staff from it.&nbsp; This is the remedy that best upholds the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> values involved and will occasion the lesser intrusion on the role of the legislature.</p>

Only minimal reference was made to this issue by counsel and, in such circumstances, the Court should avoid making far-reaching conclusions that are not necessary to the case before it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in light of the importance that will be attached to the majority’s views, the following comments are made.&nbsp; At the time of Confederation, there were no enforceable limits on the power of the British Parliament to interfere with the judiciary.&nbsp; By expressing, by way of preamble, a desire to have “a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom”, the framers of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> did not give courts the power to strike down legislation violating the principle of judicial independence.&nbsp;

Because only superior courts fell within the ambit of the<i> Act of Settlement</i> and under “constitutional” protection in the British sense, the protection sought to be created for inferior courts in the present appeals is in no way similar to anything found in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Implying protection for judicial independence from the preambular commitment to a British-style constitution, therefore, entirely misapprehends the fundamental nature of that constitution.&nbsp; To the extent that courts in Canada have the power to enforce the principle of judicial independence, this power derives from the structure of Canadian, and not British, constitutionalism.&nbsp; Our Constitution expressly contemplates both the power of judicial review (in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec52" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;52<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1982<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>) and guarantees of judicial independence (in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec96" target="_blank">ss.&nbsp;96<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>-<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec100" target="_blank">100<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">d<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>).&nbsp; Given that the express provisions dealing with constitutional protection for judicial independence have specifically spelled out their application, it seems strained to extend the ambit of this protection by reference to a general preambular statement.&nbsp; It is emphasized that these express protections for judicial independence are broad and powerful.&nbsp; They apply to all superior court and other judges specified in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec96" target="_blank">s. 96<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>as well as to inferior (provincial) courts exercising criminal jurisdiction.&nbsp;

Reg. 29/92, and the <i>Management Employees Pension Plan</i>, Alta. Reg. 367/93, which respectively had the effect of reducing the base salary for calculating pension benefits, and limiting cost of living increases to 60 percent of the Consumer Price Index.&nbsp; In addition, the respondents challenged the constitutionality of the power of the Attorney General to designate the court’s sitting days and judges’ place of residence.&nbsp; McDonald J., on the motions, also put at issue the process for disciplining Provincial Court judges and the grounds for removal of judges of the Provincial Court.</p>

Provincial Court were still independent for the purposes of s. 11(<i>d</i>), because of the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the&nbsp; <i>Public Sector Pay Reduction Act</i>.&nbsp; The Act had reduced their salaries as part of an overall public economic measure designed to meet a legitimate government objective.&nbsp; It was non-discriminatory in that it applied generally to virtually everyone paid from the public purse.&nbsp; Furthermore, after the salary reduction, the right of judges to their salaries remained established by law and was beyond arbitrary interference by the government.&nbsp; Finally, there was no evidence that the Act had been enacted for an improper or colourable purpose.&nbsp; Mitchell J.A. therefore answered “yes” to question 2.</p>

Provincial Court, following the enactment of the<i> Public Sector Pay Reduction Act</i>.&nbsp; The degree of concern is indicated by the fact that over 70 cases before the Provincial Court were adjourned to allow defendants to apply to the Supreme Court of P.E.I. for a determination of the independence of Provincial Court judges.&nbsp; At the time of the issuing of the reference, 20 such cases were pending before the P.E.I. Supreme Court.</p>

Provincial Court are remunerated.&nbsp; At the time of this reference, the three members of the Provincial Court of P.E.I. were paid an annual salary of $98,243.&nbsp; The statement of facts also contrasts the salaries of Provincial Court judges with the per capita income averages across Canada and in P.E.I., and provides some data on income distribution within a number of provinces, including P.E.I.&nbsp; These statistics convey the general impression that Provincial Court judges in P.E.I., even after the salary reductions, are paid very well relative to the population as a whole, particularly in P.E.I.</p>

Provincial Court and the government in which the judges agreed to a pay reduction and then a salary freeze.&nbsp; As well, immediately before the enactment of the Act, the government had indicated a willingness to discuss alternative measures whereby the reduction in remuneration envisioned by the Act could be achieved with the judges.&nbsp; The statement acknowledges that Chief Judge Plamondon indicated his desire to meet with the government; however, for reasons not explained, the requested meeting did not take place.</p>

Provincial Court.&nbsp; The picture which emerges is that administrators make many of the important day-to-day decisions at the court, including those which directly affect the working conditions of judges (e.g., the hiring, dismissal, setting of work hours, and management of sick leaves of staff), and also ensure that the Provincial Court operates within a budget set by the province.&nbsp; However, Provincial Court judges have discretion with respect to the hours of their work, holidays and time off, continuing legal education, and the setting and maintaining control and operation of their own schedules and dockets.&nbsp; Collectively, they assign dockets, arraignment days&nbsp; and courtrooms for cases.&nbsp; As well, a government official, the Director of Legal and Judicial Services, represents the Attorney General on a committee consisting of the Chief Justices of the P.E.I. Supreme Court Appeal and Trial Divisions and the Chief Judge of the Provincial Court.&nbsp; This committee meets periodically to discuss general administration and budgeting issues for the court system.</p>

Sullivan, at p. 261.&nbsp; The preamble to the<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, certainly operates in this fashion.&nbsp; However, in my view, it goes even further.&nbsp; In the words of Rand J., the preamble&nbsp; articulates “the political theory which the Act embodies”: <i>Switzman</i>,<i> supra</i>, at p. 306.&nbsp; It recognizes and affirms the basic principles which are the very source of the substantive provisions of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; As I have said above, those provisions merely elaborate those organizing principles in the institutional apparatus they create or contemplate.&nbsp; As such, the preamble is not only a key to construing the express provisions of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, but also invites the use of those organizing principles to fill out gaps in the express terms of the constitutional scheme.&nbsp; It is the means by which the underlying logic of the Act can be given the force of law.</p>

De Savoye</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, at p. 1099.&nbsp; An alternative explanation of the decision, however, is that the Court was merely giving effect to the “[d]esire” of the founding provinces “to be federally united into One Dominion”, an organizing principle of the Constitution that was recognized and affirmed in the preamble, and which was given express form in the provisions identified by La Forest J.</p>

Township of South Norwich</i> (1895), 24 S.C.R. 145, at p. 149.&nbsp; I would venture that the doctrine of paramountcy follows from the desire of the confederating provinces “to be federally united into One Dominion”.&nbsp; Relying on the preamble explains, for example, why federal laws are paramount over provincial laws, not the other way around.</p>

(as he then was) considered the significance of the preamble’s reference to “a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom” in <i>Southam Inc. v.

Public Service Staff Relations Board</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 455, at p. 469;<i> R. v. Power</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 620.&nbsp; Courts, in other words, are equally “definitional to the Canadian understanding of constitutionalism” (<i>Cooper</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 11) as are political institutions.&nbsp; It follows that the same constitutional imperative — the preservation of the basic structure — which led Beetz J. to limit the power of legislatures to affect the operation of political institutions, also extends protection to the judicial institutions of our constitutional system.&nbsp; By implication, the jurisdiction of the provinces over “courts”, as that term is used in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec92subsec14" target="_blank">s. 92(14)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, contains within it an implied limitation that the independence of those courts cannot be undermined.</p>

Lippé</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114, the independence protected by s. 11(<i>d</i>) is the independence of the judiciary from the other branches of government, and bodies which can exercise pressure on the judiciary through power conferred on them by the state.</p>

inter-ideograph;line-height:12.2pt">Without that confidence the system cannot command the respect and acceptance that are essential to its effective operation.&nbsp; It is, therefore, important that a tribunal should be perceived as independent, as well as impartial, and that the test for independence should include that perception.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">However, it would be a mistake to conclude that Le Dain J. intended the objective guarantees and the reasonable perception of independence to be two distinct concepts.&nbsp; Rather, the objective guarantees must be viewed as those guarantees that are necessary to ensure a reasonable perception of independence.&nbsp; As Le Dain J. said himself, for a court or tribunal to be perceived as independent, that “perception must . . . be a perception of whether the tribunal enjoys the essential objective conditions or guarantees of judicial independence” (p. 689).&nbsp;</p>

inter-ideograph;line-height:12.2pt">. . . the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information.&nbsp; In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is “what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically — and having thought the matter through — conclude. . . .”</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:

Schmeiser and W. Howard McConnell in <i>The Independence of Provincial Court Judges: A Public Trust</i> (1996), at p. 13:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;line-height:12.2pt">Because of the constitutional convention that judges should not speak out on political matters, judges are at a disadvantage vis-à-vis other groups when making a case to governments for increments in salaries.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:24.4pt">I have no doubt that this is the case, although to some extent, the inability of judges to engage in negotiations is offset by the guarantees provided by s. 11(<i>d</i>).&nbsp; In particular, the mandatory involvement of an independent commission serves as a substitute for negotiations, because it provides a forum in which members of the judiciary can raise concerns about the level of their remuneration that might have otherwise been advanced at the bargaining table.&nbsp; Moreover, a commission serves as an institutional sieve which protects the courts from political interference through economic manipulation, a danger which inheres in salary negotiations.</p>

Provincial Court and the executive.&nbsp; The appellants centre their submissions on s. 12(1), which is found in Part IV, entitled “Saving for Future Negotiations”.&nbsp; According to the appellants, s. 12(1) permits negotiations between any persons whose salaries are reduced by the Act and the government to find alternatives to pay reductions.&nbsp; If s. 12(1) had this effect, I would agree with the appellants that it contravened the principle of judicial independence.&nbsp; I note that this view of the Act has been taken by MacDonald C.J. of the P.E.I. Supreme Court, Trial Division in <i>Lowther v. Prince Edward Island </i>(1994), 118 D.L.R. (4th) 665.&nbsp; Moreover, as the court below pointed out in<i> Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island</i>, the Lieutenant Governor in Council of P.E.I. enacted a regulation subsequent to the decision in <i>Lowther</i> to clarify that the negotiation provisions did not cover Provincial Court judges (Regulation EC631/94).</p>

Provincial Court are governed by Part III, which is entitled “Persons Paid from Public Funds”.&nbsp; Given the attempt of the Act to draw a distinction between persons like judges on the one hand, and public sector employees on the other, I have little doubt that the negotiation provisions, which expressly refer to public sector employees, do not apply to judges.</p>

Paquette</i> (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 333 (Alta. C.A.); &nbsp;<i>R. v. Yes Holdings Ltd.</i> (1987), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 30 (Alta. C.A.).&nbsp; Indeed, <i>Paquette</i> is analogous to these appeals, because the accused sought a prohibition and declaration at trial, but was only granted a declaration.&nbsp; The Crown appealed.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal held that it had jurisdiction under s. 719(1) (now s. 784(1)) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, because the declaration was “in effect and intent prohibitory” (pp. 337-38).</p>

Reg. 116/94.&nbsp; This regulation set the salary of the Chief Judge at $124,245, the Assistant Chief Judge at $117,338, and other members of the Provincial Court at $110,431.&nbsp; These salaries had previously been set at $128,220, $121,092, and $113,964 by <i>Payment to Provincial Judges Amendment Regulation</i>, Alta. Reg. 171/91.&nbsp; Second, an additional 1.9 percent reduction was achieved through five unpaid days of leave (two unpaid statutory holidays and three unpaid work days).&nbsp; Unfortunately, we have not been pointed to the legal instrument through which those days of leave were imposed on members of the Provincial Court.&nbsp; I can only assume that these days of leave were achieved pursuant to s. 17(1)(d)(iii) of the <i>Provincial Court Judges Act</i>, which authorizes the Lieutenant Governor in Council to provide for leaves of absence.</p>

Conseil de la magistrature</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 267, at para. 59.&nbsp; Important decisions regarding administrative independence cannot be made by the Chief Judge alone.&nbsp; In my opinion, the decision to close the Manitoba Provincial Court is precisely this kind of decision.&nbsp;</p>

Davidson</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038), this is very difficult in relation to violations of s. 11(<i>d</i>) because, unlike other <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> provisions, it requires that judicial independence be secured by “objective conditions or guarantees” (<i>Valente</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 685).&nbsp; Objective guarantees are the means by which the reasonable perception of independence is secured and, hence, any legislative provision which does not contain those objective guarantees is unconstitutional.&nbsp; In effect, then, to read down the legislation to its proper scope would amount to reading in those objective conditions and guarantees.&nbsp; This would result in a fundamental rewriting of the legislation.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the Court were to strike down the legislation in its entirety, the effect would be to prevent its application to all those employees of the Government of Manitoba who were required to take leave without pay.&nbsp; In the circumstances, the best solution would be to read down the legislation so that it would simply not apply to government workers employed in the Manitoba Provincial Court.&nbsp; In other words, the provision should be read as exempting provincial court staff from it.&nbsp; This is the remedy that best upholds the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> values involved and will occasion the lesser intrusion on the role of the legislature.&nbsp; See <i>Osborne v.

Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy)</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at para. 9:</p>

 <p class="LongQuotes" style="margin-left:.8in;text-indent:20.85pt;line-height:

Wharton</i>, [1915] A.C. 330, at p. 339, stated that the abstract logical definition of the scope of constitutional provisions is not only “impracticable, but is certain, if attempted, to cause embarrassment and possible injustice in future cases”.</p>

R. Lederman, “The Independence of the Judiciary” (1956), 34 <i>Can. Bar Rev.</i> 769 and 1139.&nbsp; In the Norman era, judicial power was concentrated in the hands of the King and his immediate entourage (the <i>Curia Regis</i>).&nbsp; Subsequent centuries saw the emergence of specialized courts and a professional judiciary, and the king’s participation in the judicial function had by the end of the fifteenth century effectively withered.&nbsp; Thus Blackstone in his <i>Commentaries</i> was able to state:</p>

V. Dicey, <i>Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution</i> (10th ed. 1959), at pp. 39-40).&nbsp; This principle has been modified somewhat in recent decades to take into account the effect of Great Britain’s membership in the European Community, but ultimately, the British Parliament remains supreme; see E. C. S. Wade and A. W. Bradley, <i>Constitutional and Administrative Law</i> (11th ed. 1993), by A. W. Bradley and K. D.

R. (2d) 51, at p. 66).&nbsp; In the case of the permissive-mandatory distinction, the evidence establishes that it served a rational and legitimate purpose.&nbsp; Though all those affected by Bill 22 were in one form or another “paid” from public funds, their relationship to government differed markedly.&nbsp; A number of the “employers” under Bill 22, such as school boards, Crown corporations, municipalities, universities and health care facilities, though ultimately dependent on government funding, have traditionally enjoyed a significant amount of financial autonomy.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the provincial government does not set the salaries of employees of these institutions.&nbsp; The legislation respects the autonomy of those bodies by permitting them to cope with reduced funding in alternative ways.&nbsp; Judges, though obviously required to be independent from government in specific, constitutionally guaranteed ways, are paid directly by the government.&nbsp; In this limited sense, they are analogous to civil servants and not to employees of other public institutions such as school boards, universities or hospitals.&nbsp; Notably, the provincial government, as an “employer” under Bill 22, required its civil servants to take unpaid leaves.&nbsp; Moreover, unlike many public employees, judges are not in a collective bargaining relationship with the government.&nbsp; The government may have felt that permitting judges to “negotiate” the manner in which they would absorb reductions to their remuneration would have been inappropriate.</p>
