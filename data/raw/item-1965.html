 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">1.&nbsp; <u>The possibility of collusion</u>:&nbsp; The trial judge noted the possibility of collusion within the victim group regarding the eyewitness identification, but in the end, according to McEachern&nbsp;C.J.B.C., this possibility “seems not to have been given any significance”.</p>

Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, 2000 SCC 15, at paras.&nbsp;36-38.</p>
