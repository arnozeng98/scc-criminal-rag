There is no suggestion in the authorities that the accused must establish that his delusion permits him to raise a specific defence, such as self-defence.&nbsp; The issue is whether the accused possessed the capacity present in the ordinary person to know that the act in question was wrong having regard to the everyday standards of the ordinary person.&nbsp; It is not necessary additionally to show that the defence of self-defence would also apply.&nbsp; Indeed, to posit such a requirement is to require the defence to prove two logically inconsistent propositions: first, that the accused was by reason of mental disorder unable to make the choice which a reasonable person would make; and second, that the accused acted reasonably in repelling an imminent attack.&nbsp; The difficulty is avoided, however, when it is recognized that s. 16 is not merely a vehicle for bringing particular defences before the court; it is an independent condition of criminal responsibility, as this Court affirmed in <i>Chaulk</i> and as the wording of the amended section makes clear.&nbsp; It may be that the nature of the delusion is to create a subjective impression in the accused's mind that he must defend himself or himself be killed, akin to that present when the defence of self-defence is raised, but that is incidental.&nbsp; Thus the question is not whether, assuming the delusions to be true, a reasonable person would have seen a threat to life and a need for death-threatening force.&nbsp; Rather, the real question is whether the accused should be exempted from criminal responsibility because a mental disorder at the time of the act deprived him of the capacity for rational perception and hence rational choice about the rightness or wrongness of the act.</span></p>

[S]uch a definition could never be acceptable in a viable criminal law.&nbsp; As the courts have rightly insisted, it is a public standard of wrong that must be used, whether public law or community morality.</span></p>
