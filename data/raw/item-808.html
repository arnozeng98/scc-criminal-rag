Law Society of British Columbia</i> (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 67 (B.C.C.A.); <i>Savion v. The Queen</i> (1980), 13 C.R. (3d) 259 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Bourget</i> (1987), 56 C.R. (3d) 97 (Sask. C.A.).&nbsp; No case in this Court has made a comprehensive examination of the subject.&nbsp; The Law Reform Commission of Canada, in a 1974 working paper titled <i>Criminal Procedure: Discovery</i> (the "1974 Working Paper") and a 1984 report titled <i>Disclosure by the Prosecution</i> (the "1984 Report"), recommended comprehensive schemes regulating disclosure by the Crown but no legislative action has been taken implementing the proposals.&nbsp; Apart from the limited legislative response contained in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec603" target="_blank">s. 603<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C., 1985, c.

The Queen</i>, [1955] S.C.R. 16, Rand J. states, at pp. 23-24:</span></p>

Beyfus</i> (1890), 25 Q.B.D. 494 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Scott</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979), and any rules with respect to disclosure would be subject to this and other rules of privilege.&nbsp; With respect to witnesses, persons who have information that may be evidence favourable to the accused will have to have their identity disclosed sooner or later.&nbsp; Even the identity of an informer is subject to this fact of life by virtue of the "innocence exception" to the informer privilege rule (<i>Marks v. Beyfus</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 498-99; <i>R. v. Scott</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 996; <i>Bisaillon v. Keable</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60, at p. 93; <i>Solicitor General of Canada v. Royal Commission of Inquiry (Health Records in Ontario)</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 494).&nbsp; It will, therefore, be a matter of the timing of the disclosure rather than whether disclosure should be made at all.&nbsp; The prosecutor must retain a degree of discretion in respect of these matters.&nbsp; The discretion, which will be subject to review, should extend to such matters as excluding what is clearly irrelevant, withholding the identity of persons to protect them from harassment or injury, or to enforce the privilege relating to informers.&nbsp; The discretion would also extend to the timing of disclosure in order to complete an investigation.&nbsp; I shall return to this subject later in these reasons.</span></p>

C. (M.H.)</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 142 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 155, McEachern C.J.B.C. after a review of the authorities stated what I respectfully accept as a correct statement of the law.&nbsp; He said that:&nbsp; "there is a general duty on the part of the Crown to disclose all material it proposes to use at trial and especially all evidence which may assist the accused even if the Crown does not propose to adduce it".&nbsp; This passage was cited with approval by McLachlin J. in her reasons on behalf of the Court ([1991] 1 S.C.R. 763).&nbsp; She went on to add:&nbsp; "This Court has previously stated that the Crown is under a duty at common law to disclose to the defence all material evidence whether favourable to the accused or not" (p. 774).</span></p>

The initial obligation to separate "the wheat from the chaff" must therefore rest with Crown counsel.&nbsp; There may also be situations in which early disclosure may impede completion of an investigation.&nbsp; Delayed disclosure on this account is not to be encouraged and should be rare.&nbsp; Completion of the investigation before proceeding with the prosecution of a charge or charges is very much within the control of the Crown.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is not always possible to predict events which may require an investigation to be re-opened and the Crown must have some discretion to delay disclosure in these circumstances.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to what should be disclosed, the general principle to which I have referred is that all relevant information must be disclosed subject to the reviewable discretion of the Crown.&nbsp; The material must include not only that which the Crown intends to introduce into evidence but also that which it does not.&nbsp; No distinction should be made between inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.&nbsp; The attempt to make this distinction in connection with the confession rule proved to be unworkable and was eventually discarded by this Court.&nbsp; See <i>Piché v. The Queen</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 23, at p. 36; <i>Rothman v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 645.&nbsp; To re-introduce the distinction here would lead to interminable controversy at trial that should be avoided.&nbsp; The Crown must, therefore, disclose relevant material whether it is inculpatory or exculpatory.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A special problem arises in respect to witness statements and is specifically raised in this case.&nbsp; There is virtually no disagreement that statements in the possession of the Crown obtained from witnesses it proposes to call should be&nbsp; produced.&nbsp; In some cases the statement will simply be recorded in notes taken by an investigator, usually a police officer.&nbsp; The notes or copies should be produced.&nbsp; If notes do not exist then a "will say" statement, summarizing the anticipated evidence of the witness, should be produced based on the information in the Crown's possession.&nbsp; A more difficult issue is posed with respect to witnesses and other persons whom the Crown does not propose to call.&nbsp; In its 1974 Working Paper, the Law Reform Commission of Canada recommended disclosure of not only the names, addresses and occupations of all "persons who have provided information to investigation or prosecution authorities" (p. 41), but the statements obtained or, if these did not exist, "a summary of the information provided by those persons not intended to be called at trial, along&nbsp; with&nbsp; a statement of the manner in which the information in each summary has been obtained..." (p. 41).&nbsp; In its 1984 Report, the Commission seemed to have changed its mind.&nbsp; It stated (at pp. 27-28):</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

C. (M.H.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, dealt with the failure to disclose either the identity or statement of a person who provided relevant information to the police but who was not called as a witness.&nbsp; McLachlin J., speaking for the Court, indicated that failure to disclose in such cases could impair the fairness of the trial.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-78.45pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">(1)Counsel for the Crown misconceived his obligation to disclose the statements;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-78.45pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">(2)The explanation for refusal that the witness was not worthy of credit was completely inadequate to support the exercise of this discretion on the ground of irrelevance.&nbsp; Whether the witness is credible is for the trial judge to determine after hearing the evidence;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

-78.45pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">(3)The trial judge ought to have examined the statements.&nbsp; The suggestion that this would have prejudiced the trial judge is without merit.&nbsp; Trial judges are frequently apprised of evidence which is ruled inadmissible.&nbsp; One example is a confession that fails to meet the test of voluntariness.&nbsp; No one would suggest that knowledge of such evidence prejudices the trial judge.&nbsp; We operate on the principle that a judge trained to screen out inadmissible evidence will disabuse himself or herself of such evidence;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 588, and <i>R. v. Mannion</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 272, at pp. 277-78.&nbsp; Most counsel faced with this prospect would likely opt not to call the witness, a matter which bears on the right to make full answer and defence.</span></p>

C. (M.H.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at. p. 776:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
