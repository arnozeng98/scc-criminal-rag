 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June&nbsp;12, 2008, M and his wife visited the accused’s naturopathic clinic. M was 84 years old, had heart disease and was frustrated with the treatment he had received at conventional medical clinics. After an hour‑long consultation, the accused recommended intravenously administered nutrients. M reacted negatively to the injection and he died of endotoxic shock some hours later. The accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death and unlawful act manslaughter. The trial judge acquitted the accused of both charges but the Court of Appeal set aside both acquittals, substituted a conviction on the charge of unlawful act manslaughter, and ordered a new trial on the criminal negligence charge.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i> (Wagner&nbsp;C.J. and Rowe&nbsp;J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals restored.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per </i>Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Côté and Brown&nbsp;JJ.: The Court of Appeal erred in holding that an intravenous injection is objectively dangerous regardless of the circumstances in which it is administered or the training, qualifications and experience of the person who administers it. The Court of Appeal<b> </b>also erred in disturbing the accused’s acquittals based on its conclusion that her<b> </b>conduct markedly departed from that of a reasonable person. These conclusions cannot be squared with the trial judge’s findings of fact which the Court of Appeal replaced with its own.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>actus reus</i> of criminal negligence causing death requires that the accused undertook an act — or omitted to do anything that it was his or her legal duty to do — and that the act or omission caused someone’s death. The fault element is that the accused’s act or omission shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons. As with other negligence‑based criminal offences, the fault element of criminal negligence causing death is assessed by measuring the degree to which the accused’s conduct departed from that of a reasonable person in the circumstances. For some negligence‑based offences, such as dangerous driving, a “marked” departure satisfies the fault element. In the context of criminal negligence causing death, however, the requisite degree of departure is as an elevated one — marked and substantial.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>actus reus</i> of unlawful act manslaughter under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec222subsec5" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;222(5)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> requires the Crown to prove that the accused committed an unlawful act and that the unlawful act caused death. The underlying unlawful act is described as the “predicate” offence. Where the predicate offence is one of strict liability, the fault element for that offence must be read as a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances. The Crown is not required to prove that the predicate offence was objectively dangerous. An objective dangerousness requirement adds nothing to the analysis that is not captured within the fault element of unlawful act manslaughter. An unlawful act, accompanied by objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory, is an objectively dangerous act. As a result, the <i>actus reus </i>of unlawful act manslaughter is satisfied by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed an unlawful act that caused death. There is no independent requirement of objective dangerousness.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fault element of both offences requires that an accused’s conduct be measured against the standard of a reasonable person in their circumstances. An activity‑sensitive approach to the modified objective<b> </b>standard should be applied. While the standard is not determined by the accused’s personal characteristics, it is informed by the activity. Evidence of training and experience may be used to rebut an allegation of being unqualified to engage in an activity or to show how a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused would have performed the activity.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In measuring the accused’s conduct against this standard in the instant case, the trial judge was obliged to consider the accused’s prior training, experience and qualifications as a naturopath. The trial judge found that the accused was properly qualified to administer intravenous injections and took the necessary precautions at every stage of administering the intravenous injection, including observing sufficient protocols to prevent sepsis. All of the trial judge’s factual findings, which were based on the evidence, amply support the conclusion that an intravenous injection, performed properly by a naturopath qualified to administer such injections, did not pose an objectively foreseeable risk of bodily harm in the circumstances.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>Wagner&nbsp;C.J. and Rowe&nbsp;J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part: the conviction for unlawful act manslaughter should be set aside and a new trial ordered on this charge. Entering a conviction on an appeal from an acquittal is an exceptional measure, and the error of law at issue here is also a rare occurrence. A conviction for manslaughter was not so inevitable as to justify the measure ordered by the Court of Appeal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The offence of unlawful act manslaughter requires proof of an underlying unlawful act. The <i>actus reus </i>of the offence has three elements: (1)&nbsp;an underlying unlawful act; (2)&nbsp;the objective dangerousness of that act; and (3)&nbsp;a causal connection between the act and the death. Unlawful act manslaughter also has two cumulative fault elements: the <i>mens&nbsp;rea</i> of the underlying act and the <i>mens&nbsp;rea</i> specific to manslaughter.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second element of the <i>actus&nbsp;reus</i>, the objective dangerousness of the unlawful act, is assessed without reference to the accused’s personal characteristics. It<i> </i>will be proved if the court is satisfied that the accused did something that a reasonable person would have known was likely to subject another person to a risk of bodily harm. In considering the <i>actus reus</i>, the court is not to assess the extent to which the accused’s conduct departed from this standard of care or the accused’s state of mind. This evidentiary threshold reflects the fact that, at this stage of the analysis, the court is considering whether the accused committed the physical element of the offence, not whether the accused had the state of mind required for a conviction.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Injecting a substance across physiological barriers is an inherently dangerous activity. The accused’s </span>experience does not alter this. The dangerousness of the act would have been established even if it had been performed by a health professional who was authorized to do so. By refusing to find that the unlawful injection was objectively dangerous, the trial court failed to arrive at the legal conclusion that was necessary in light of the facts as found. This was an error of law<span style="line-height:200%"> whose impact is such that it requires a new trial</span>.</p>

She has a degree in science from McGill University, a doctorate in naturopathic medicine from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon, and a related diploma which involved 500 hours of further courses. Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s education included classes and clinical training about intravenous injection techniques. She has treated between 4,000 and 5,000 patients at her clinic since it opened and, starting in 1992, has administered nutrients to approximately ten patients per week by way of intravenous injection. Intravenous administration of nutrients by naturopaths is not legal in Quebec but is lawful in most provinces.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par2" class="">2</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 12, 2008, Roger Matern and his wife visited Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s clinic. Mr.&nbsp;Matern was 84 years old and had heart disease. He was frustrated with the treatment he had received at conventional medical clinics and hoped that naturopathy would improve his quality of life. After an hour-long consultation, Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi recommended intravenously administered nutrients. Despite Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s telling him that she did not normally administer intravenous injections on a first visit, Mr.&nbsp;Matern insisted on having an intravenous treatment that day.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par3" class="">3</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi prepared the nutrient solution for Mr.&nbsp;Matern’s intravenous injection. It contained magnesium chloride, manganese chloride, potassium chloride, L-Taurine, L-Carnitine, and sterile water. To create the solution, Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi combined nutrients from separate vials. One vial contained L-Carnitine. Mr.&nbsp;Matern was the third patient to whom L-Carnitine from the same vial had been administered that day. The other two patients did not have adverse reactions to their injections. The vial turned out to be contaminated.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par4" class="">4</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.&nbsp;Matern reacted negatively to the injection almost immediately. He complained of being hot and nauseous. Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi stopped the intravenous injection and checked Mr.&nbsp;Matern’s vital signs, which were stable. Mr.&nbsp;Matern had no fever, was not experiencing confusion, and there was no sign of infection on the site of the injection.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par5" class="">5</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s career, no patient had ever been infected during an intravenous injection. She thought that Mr.&nbsp;Matern could be having a hypoglycaemic reaction and suggested he eat some sugar. Mr.&nbsp;Matern consumed a spoonful of honey and orange juice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par6" class="">6</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite his symptoms, Mr.&nbsp;Matern said that he did not want to go to the hospital.

Her four-year education there included one year of courses based on traditional medicine. She was also trained in the administration of intravenous injections, pharmacology, and the interaction of nutrients with other medications. In addition, she got a diploma from the Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians, which involved 500 hours of courses.

Villemure&nbsp;J. was not satisfied that a reasonable person would have been aware of any risk inherent in Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct and therefore concluded that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct showed wanton or reckless disregard for Mr.&nbsp;Matern’s life or safety.</p>

It concluded that Villemure&nbsp;J. misstated the elements of unlawful act manslaughter and criminal negligence causing death, and further erred by considering the training that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi had received in the course of her education to become a naturopath. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the intravenous injection was objectively dangerous and Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct constituted a marked departure from the reasonable person standard.

J.F.</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 215, this Court confirmed that the offence of criminal negligence causing death imposes a modified objective standard of fault — the objective “reasonable person” standard (paras. 7-9; see also <i>R. v. Tutton</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, at pp. 1429-31; <i>R. v. Morrisey</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, at para. 19; <i>R. v. Beatty</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, at para. 7).</p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">[3]</span></sup></span></sup></span></a> For some negligence-based offences, such as dangerous driving, a “marked” departure satisfies the fault element (<i>J.F.</i>, at para. 10; see also: <i>Beatty</i>, at para. 33; <i>R. v. Roy</i>, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 60, at para. 30;<i> R. v. L. (J.)&nbsp;</i>(2006), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 324 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 15; <i>R. v. Al-Kassem</i>, 2015 ONCA 320, 78 M.V.R. (6th) 183, at para. 6). In the context of criminal negligence causing death, however, the requisite degree of departure has been described as an elevated one — marked <i>and</i> substantial (<i>J.F.</i>, at para. 9, applying <i>Tutton</i>, at pp. 1430-31,&nbsp;and <i>R. v. Sharp</i>&nbsp;(1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A.)).</p>

They both ask whether the accused’s actions created a risk to others, and whether “a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk and taken steps to avoid it if possible” (see <i>Roy</i>, at para. 36; Stewart, at p. 248). The distinction between them has been described as a matter of degree (see <i>R. v. Fontaine</i> (2017), 41 C.R. (7th) 330, at para. 27; <i>R. v. Blostein</i> (2014), 306 Man.&nbsp;R. (2d) 15, at para. 14). As Healy&nbsp;J.A. explained in <i>Fontaine</i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">These differences of degree cannot be measured by a ruler, a thermometer or any other instrument of calibrated scale. The words “marked and substantial” departure are adjectives used to paraphrase or interpret “wanton or reckless disregard” in section 219 of the Code but they do not, and cannot, indicate any objective and fixed order of magnitude that would have prescriptive value from one case to another. As with the assessment of conduct in cases of criminal negligence, the assessment of fault by the trier of fact is entirely contextual. [para. 27]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par23" class="">23</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>J.F.</i>, Fish&nbsp;J. did not fully explain how to distinguish between a “marked” and a “marked and substantial” departure, as the case did not “turn on the nature or extent of the difference between the two standards” (paras. 10-11). In this appeal, as well, the differences in etymology are not dispositive and need not be resolved. In any event, the parties argued on the basis that the proper threshold for criminal negligence causing death is a “marked and substantial” departure, and that is the basis on which these reasons approach the issue. A conviction for criminal negligence causing death therefore requires the Crown to prove that the accused undertook an act, or omitted to do anything that it was her legal duty to do, and that the act or omission caused the death of another person (the <i>actus reus</i>). Based on <i>J.F.</i>,<i> </i>the Crown must also establish that the accused’s conduct constituted a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonable person in the accused’s circumstances (the fault element).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par25" class="">25</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>actus reus</i> of unlawful act manslaughter under s. 222(5)(a) requires the Crown to prove that the accused committed an unlawful act and that the unlawful act caused death (<i>R. v. Creighton</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 42-43; <i>R. v. DeSousa</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at pp. 959 and 961-62). The underlying unlawful act is described as the “predicate” offence (<i>DeSousa</i>, at p. 956;<i> Creighton</i>, at p.&nbsp;42). The predicate offence in Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s case is administering the intravenous injection contrary to s.&nbsp;31 of Quebec’s <i>Medical Act</i>, a strict liability offence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par26" class="">26</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There has been some uncertainty around whether the Crown must prove that the predicate offence was “objectively dangerous” (see Larry C. Wilson, “Too Many Manslaughters” (2007), 52 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 433, at p.&nbsp;459, citing Isabel Grant, Dorothy Chunn and Christine Boyle, <i>The Law of Homicide</i> (loose-leaf), at pp.&nbsp;4-15, 4-16 and 4-20; Stanley Yeo, “The Fault Elements for Involuntary Manslaughter: Some Lessons from Downunder” (2000), 43 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 291, at p.&nbsp;293). In my view, the “objective dangerousness” requirement adds nothing to the analysis that is not captured within the fault element of unlawful act manslaughter — objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory (<i>Creighton</i>, at pp.&nbsp;44-45). An unlawful act, accompanied by objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory, is an objectively dangerous act.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par27" class="">27</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Support for this position is found in <i>DeSousa</i>, which has been cited as the definitive statement of the fault element of unlawful act manslaughter (<i>Creighton</i>, at pp. 44-45). In <i>DeSousa</i>, Sopinka&nbsp;J. considered the meaning of “unlawful act” for the purposes of the offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm, concluding that the unlawful act must be objectively dangerous in the sense that there is objective foreseeability of bodily harm:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">English authority has consistently held that the underlying unlawful act required by its manslaughter offence requires proof that the unlawful act was “likely to injure another person” or in other words put the bodily integrity of others at risk (see also <i>R. v. Hall</i> (1961), 45 Cr. App. R. 366 (C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Church</i> (1965), 49 Cr. App. R. 206 (C.C.A.); <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Newbury</i> (1976), 62 Cr. App. R. 291 (H.L.), and <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Daley</i> (1978), 69 Cr. App. R. 39 (P.C.)). This position has also been adopted by most Canadian courts. [p. 959]</p>

As Patrick Healy observed, this Court in <i>Creighton</i> agreed that the element of dangerousness connotes an element of fault (“The <i>Creighton</i> Quartet: Enigma Variations in a Lower Key” (1993), 23 C.R. (4th) 265, at pp. 271-73). Others too have suggested that “dangerousness can be seen as entirely subsumed within the concept of foreseeability of harm, and should be discarded as unnecessarily complicated” (Grant et al., at pp. 4-15 to 4-16; see also <i>R. v. Plein</i> (2018), 50 C.R. (7th) 41, at para. 30; <i>R. v. Kahnapace</i> (2010), 76 C.R. (6th) 38, at para. 28; <i>R. v. L.M.</i>, 2018 NWTTC 6, at para. 31 (CanLII); <i>R. v.

Model jury instructions already avoid this repetition, which introduces unnecessary complexity into the offence of unlawful act manslaughter, increasing the risk of confusion and legal error (the Hon. Justice David Watt, <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (2nd ed. 2015), at p. 739; Gerry A. Ferguson and the Hon. Justice Michael R. Dambrot, <i>CRIMJI: Canadian Criminal Jury Instructions </i>(4th ed. (loose-leaf)), vol. 2, at p. 6.39-6; National Judicial Institute, <i>Model Jury Instructions</i> (online, at D.6)).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par31" class="">31</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;The fault element of unlawful act manslaughter is, as noted, objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory, coupled with the fault element for the predicate offence (<i>Creighton</i>, at pp.&nbsp;42-43;<i> DeSousa</i>, at pp.&nbsp;961-62). I agree with the Court of Appeal that where the predicate offence is one of strict liability, as in this case, the fault element for that offence must be read as a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances (see also Grant et al., at pp. 4-14 to 4-15; Larry C. Wilson, “<i>Beatty</i>, <i>J.F.</i>, and the Law of Manslaughter” (2010), 47 <i>Alta. L. Rev.</i> 651, at pp. 663-64; Kent Roach, <i>Criminal Law</i> (7th ed. 2018), at p. 466; <i>R. v.

This approach aligns with <i>Creighton</i>, where McLachlin&nbsp;J. clarified that predicate offences involving carelessness or negligence must be read as requiring a marked departure from the standard of the reasonable person (p. 59).<b> </b></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par34" class="">34</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal held that in acquitting Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi of both charges, Villemure&nbsp;J. misapplied the “reasonable person” standard. According to the Court of Appeal, Villemure&nbsp;J. erred by referring to Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s training and experience in intravenous injections when deciding whether her conduct constituted a marked departure from that of a reasonable person. In the Court of Appeal’s view, evidence of Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s academic training was not relevant to the nature and circumstances of the activity.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par35" class="">35</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I see no error in how Villemure&nbsp;J. assessed the reasonableness of Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct.</p>

In that case, a woman died as a result of a cocaine injection given to her by Marc Creighton, a drug dealer. McLachlin&nbsp;J. clarified that the modified<b> </b>objective standard is “that of the reasonable person in all the circumstances of the case” (p.&nbsp;41). She endorsed the “reasonable person” standard in order to maintain “a uniform standard for all persons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. regardless of their background, education or psychological disposition” (p.&nbsp;60). In her view, “[w]ithout a constant minimum standard, the duty imposed by the law would be eroded and the criminal sanction trivialized” (p. 70). She concluded that Mr.&nbsp;Creighton’s habitual drug use<b> </b>was not to be considered in setting the “reasonable person” standard.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par37" class="">37</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLachlin&nbsp;J. explained, however, that greater care may be expected of the “reasonable person” on the basis of the nature and circumstances of the activity (p. 72). Certain activities, for example, require special attention and skill. An accused undertaking such an activity may be found to have breached the reasonable person standard if he or she is not qualified to provide the special care that the activity requires, or negligently failed to exercise such care while engaged in the activity. In this way, the law maintains a “constant minimum standard” for <i>every</i> person who engages in an activity requiring special care and skill: they must be both qualified <i>and</i> exercise the special care that the activity requires.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par38" class="">38</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<i>Creighton</i>’s activity-sensitive approach to the modified objective<b> </b>standard has been applied in a variety of contexts, including in cases involving driving, hunting and parenting (<i>Beatty</i>, at para. 40; <i>R. v. Gendreau</i>, 2015 QCCA 1910, at para. 30 (CanLII); <i>J.F.</i>, at paras. 8-9). These decisions confirm that while the standard is not determined by the accused’s personal characteristics, it <i>is</i> informed by the activity. In this case, the activity is administering an intravenous injection, and the standard to be applied is that of the reasonably prudent naturopath in the circumstances.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par39" class="">39</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In measuring Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct against this standard, Villemure&nbsp;J. was not only entitled, she was obliged to consider her prior training, experience and qualifications as a naturopath. Where the Crown’s theory is, as it is in this case, that the accused engaged in an activity without the requisite training and knowledge, the accused’s activity-specific knowledge and experience are clearly relevant to determining whether the applicable standard of care was met. An accused’s training and experience may, for example, be used to rebut an allegation of being unqualified to engage in an activity. Evidence of training and experience may also be used to show how a reasonable person would have performed the activity in the circumstances.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par40" class="">40</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s professional experience and her education were relevant in determining whether she was qualified for the activity in which she was engaged and were, as a result, relevant in determining whether she met the applicable standard of care. I see no error in Villemure&nbsp;J.’s treatment of this evidence, which the defence adduced to rebut the allegation that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was not qualified to administer an intravenous injection. The Court of Appeal, with respect, erred in overturning Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s acquittals on this basis.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par41" class="">41</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal<b> </b>also erred in disturbing Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s acquittals based on its conclusion that her<b> </b>conduct markedly departed from that of a reasonable person. This conclusion, with respect, cannot be squared with Villemure&nbsp;J.’s findings of fact. Based on these findings, which the Court of Appeal inexplicably replaced with its own, Villemure&nbsp;J. concluded that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct did not constitute a marked departure from that of a reasonable person in her circumstances. As explained above, Villemure&nbsp;J. found that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was properly qualified to administer intravenous injections; aligned her practice with established professional standards in other jurisdictions; purchased nutrients from a reputable Ontario pharmacy; chose nutrients that were appropriate for Mr.&nbsp;Matern’s condition; stored and preserved the vial used for the intravenous injection in a manner consistent with the properties of the vial and the instructions of the supplying pharmacist; and took the necessary precautions at every stage of administering the intravenous injection, including observing sufficient protocols to prevent sepsis.</p>

George</i>, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 17). There is no basis for overturning Villemure&nbsp;J.’s findings or her conclusion that the marked departure threshold was not met. It was not open to the Court of Appeal, with respect, to reweigh the evidence or substitute its own factual findings on this critical issue.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par43" class="">43</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor was the Court of Appeal justified in interfering with the acquittal for criminal negligence causing death because Villemure&nbsp;J. had misstated the applicable legal standard. The Court of Appeal concluded that by applying the marked departure instead of the marked <i>and substantial</i> departure standard, Villemure&nbsp;J. erred. She did, but since Villemure&nbsp;J. found that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct did not meet the <i>lower</i> threshold of a marked departure from the reasonable person standard, she would not have found that the conduct satisfied the <i>higher</i> standard of a marked and substantial departure. The erroneous articulation of the fault element for criminal negligence causing death was therefore irrelevant to the outcome.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par44" class="">44</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the acquittal for unlawful act manslaughter, the Court of Appeal held that Villemure&nbsp;J. erred in law by failing to recognize that intravenous injections are objectively dangerous. As I have explained, objective dangerousness is no longer an independent requirement of unlawful act manslaughter — it has been subsumed in the fault element of whether there was an objectively foreseeable risk of bodily harm.<b> </b>All of Villemure&nbsp;J.’s factual findings, which were based on the evidence, amply support the conclusion that an intravenous injection, performed properly by a naturopath qualified to administer such injections, did not pose an objectively foreseeable risk of bodily harm in the circumstances. Villemure&nbsp;J. considered both the act being performed and the person performing it, as she was required to do when assessing whether a risk of bodily harm is objectively foreseeable in the context of an activity requiring special care. The Court of Appeal erred in substituting its view that an intravenous injection is objectively dangerous regardless of the circumstances in which it is administered.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par45" class="">45</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do, however, agree with the Court of Appeal that Villemure&nbsp;J. erred in her articulation of the fault element for unlawful act manslaughter by stating that it required objective foreseeability of a risk of death. The proper test is objective foreseeability of a risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory. But this error was immaterial, because even had Villemure&nbsp;J. applied the proper test, she would still have acquitted Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi based on her conclusion that the intravenous injection was not objectively dangerous, because a reasonable person in these circumstances would not have foreseen a risk of <i>harm</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par46" class="">46</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the acquittals for both criminal negligence causing death and unlawful act manslaughter. In view of these conclusions, it is unnecessary to consider the constitutional issues.</p>

Does the answer to this question depend on the training or experience of the person performing the act? These are the questions raised by this appeal.

It is admitted that she did so knowingly and regularly for several years, thereby committing the offence of practising medicine illegally, a provincial penal offence of strict liability.</p>

Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi drew a substance from that vial to administer an injection to Mr. Roger Matern, which caused him to develop septic shock that proved to be fatal. She was charged with criminal negligence causing death and unlawful act manslaughter. Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was initially acquitted of both charges by the trial court (C.Q., No.&nbsp;500‑01‑013474‑082, April&nbsp;8, 2015). The Crown then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which convicted Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi of the latter charge and ordered a new trial on the former (2018 QCCA 856, 47 C.R. (7th) 296). Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi is asking this Court to restore the initial acquittals.</p>

The uncontested evidence shows that such an act is objectively dangerous because the injection of a substance across physiological barriers poses inherent risks. In addition, the contaminated vial used by Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was a “single‑dose” vial and contained no preservative. In spite of this, she had previously used it for two other clients the morning of June&nbsp;12, contrary to the recommended practice.</p>

This was an error of law (<i>R.&nbsp;v. J.M.H.</i>, 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3&nbsp;S.C.R. 197), whose impact is such that it requires a new trial (<i>Vézeau&nbsp;v.

Because it requires proof of an underlying unlawful act, the offence has two cumulative fault elements: the <i>mens&nbsp;rea</i> of the underlying act and the <i>mens&nbsp;rea</i> specific to manslaughter.

My colleague is of the view that this element is superfluous in the case of manslaughter because it duplicates the fault element, that is, foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm (<i>R.&nbsp;v.

The <i>actus reus </i>will be proved if the court is satisfied that the accused did something that a reasonable person would have known was likely to subject another person to a risk of harm. In considering the <i>actus reus</i>, the court is not to assess the extent to which the accused’s conduct departed from this standard of care or the accused’s state of mind. Rather, the <i>actus reus </i>of penal negligence, like that of civil negligence, will be established where the court is satisfied that the impugned conduct deviated from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent person. This evidentiary threshold reflects the fact that, at this stage of the analysis, the court is considering whether the accused committed the physical element of the offence, not whether the accused had the state of mind required for a conviction.</p>

This does not involve the application of the modified objective test, which allows the court to consider limited contextual factors. That test is instead applied in analyzing <i>mens&nbsp;rea</i> and, where it is met, has the effect of exculpating an accused who has not breached the standard of care sufficiently for criminal liability to be imposed. It is important to note that the relevance of certain contextual factors that is described in <i>Creighton</i>, which I will discuss shortly, concerns the analysis of <i>mens&nbsp;rea</i>. The guidance provided by McLachlin&nbsp;J. (as she then was) on the consideration of such factors was in the context of the “debate about the degree to which personal characteristics should be reflected in the objective test <u>for fault</u> in offences of penal negligence” (<i>Creighton</i>, at p.&nbsp;60 (emphasis added)).</p>

Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi argues for a strict interpretation of this concept. In her submission, this requirement will not be met unless the death results from the unlawful nature of the impugned conduct. She therefore argues that it was not sufficient in the case at bar to connect the death to the injection. Rather, the death had to have been caused by the illegal practice of medicine. I disagree.</p>

At the stage where the causal connection is considered, she defines the act as being the illegal practice of medicine, but in her argument for uniform rules on the matter across provinces and territories, she focuses instead on the act of administering the injection (because, of course, the illegal practice of medicine is prohibited throughout the country). Furthermore, the emphasis she wishes to place on the connection between the unlawful nature of the act and the death is inconsistent with the detailed analytical approach used for negligence. The trial judge’s finding that the injection given by Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi caused the victim’s death is therefore perfectly valid.</p>

A number of such violations, whether under a federal or a provincial enactment, involve “strict liability” and therefore lie midway between absolute liability offences, for which there is no fault element, and “<i>mens&nbsp;rea</i>” offences, for which the Crown must prove fault. Therefore, as Doyon&nbsp;J.A. wrote for the Quebec Court of Appeal with regard to strict liability:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-22.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. proving <i>actus reus</i> (the material elements of the offence) has the effect of compelling the defendant to deny the presumed intent (or the moral aspect), either by demonstrating his reasonable diligence or by establishing the existence of an error of fact based on reasonable grounds that explains his conduct<span style="background:white">.</span></p>

To ensure a minimum degree of moral blameworthiness, the Crown must therefore establish a negligent state of mind corresponding to a “marked departure”. The purpose is unquestionably a laudable one: to ensure that the accused had a culpable state of mind reflecting the seriousness of the crime. The fact that strict liability is a form of penal negligence explains the reliance on an objective fault element, that is, <i>marked departure</i>.</p>

Moreover, in analyzing the validity of Mr.&nbsp;Matern’s consent, the trial judge stated that it could be inferred from the evidence that, before the injection, he and his family [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “accepted the inherent risks” of the treatment proposed by Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi knowing that she was not a physician in the traditional sense of the term and that she administered nutrients intravenously (para.&nbsp;409).

If the prosecution cannot establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the act committed — considered without regard to the context — was objectively dangerous, then the court does not have to conduct the more thorough analysis required for <i>mens rea</i>, which could make it necessary for the accused to advance and prove a defence in order to exculpate himself or herself. However, the analytical framework proposed by my colleague also leads to the conclusion that the trial judge made an error earlier in her decision that magnified the impact of the errors that followed it. Were the <i>actus&nbsp;reus</i> of the offence to require only the commission of an unlawful act causing death, the physical element of the offence<i> </i>would clearly be established in the instant case. It is not in dispute that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was not legally authorized to administer an injection to Mr.&nbsp;Matern and that that unlawful act caused his death.

At this stage in the analysis, the accused’s training may become relevant, depending on what charges have been laid. Where the Crown argues that a person breached the standard of care by engaging in an activity without being qualified to exercise the required care, it is then for the court to consider any evidence adduced to show that the person was in fact qualified. However, the person’s experience is not relevant in determining what is required by the standard of care or what special care is required by the activity in question. As McLachlin&nbsp;J. explained, “[a] brain surgeon performing surgery in a grossly negligent way might violate the standard in this second way” (<i>Creighton</i>, at p.&nbsp;73).</p>

Consideration of Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s qualifications at the <i>mens rea</i> stage was therefore not an error as such. However, I am of the view that the trial judge erred in confining herself to the argument that because Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi had the training required to administer injections and was accustomed to doing so without any complications occurring, a reasonable person in her position could not have anticipated the risk of bodily harm.

This did not obviate the need to analyze the second possibility for breaching the standard of care, that is, failure to exercise the required care. Although it was established that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was qualified to exercise the care required to administer an intravenous injection, that training could not affect the level of care she had to meet.</p>

The dangerousness of the act would have been established even if it had been performed by a health professional who was authorized to do so: the difference lies rather in Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s qualifications to perform the act in question and in the care exercised in performing it. Injecting a substance across physiological barriers is an “inherently dangerous activity”, like driving (<i>Beatty</i>, at para.&nbsp;31). On this point, the trial judge erred.</p>

It found only that there was a <i>marked departure</i>, because it did not think that the evidence led inevitably to a finding of <i>marked and substantial </i>departure. It therefore ordered a new trial on the offence of criminal negligence causing death.</p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP" style="margin-top:0in">It should also be noted that the vial used had no date of manufacture or expiration date on it, that the label showed a concentration that was not the actual concentration and that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi did not wear a smock or other proper clothing when she administered the injection (C.A., at para.&nbsp;87).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

While it is a palpable error as regards the dangerous act, it is not as palpable as regards the <i>marked departure</i> standard. I am of the view that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s conduct constitutes a marked departure, particularly because she used a single‑dose vial three times, although I acknowledge that the trial judge reached the opposite conclusion and that she had evidence tending to support that conclusion, namely testimony to the effect that public institutions sometimes use single‑dose vials more than once despite official recommendations to the contrary (A.F., at para.&nbsp;17).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par81" class="">81</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, presumably because she considered the post‑offence conduct irrelevant given her key finding of fact on the causal connection, the trial judge failed to consider whether Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was qualified to deal with any complications, a point that had been vigorously argued before her. As a result, the Court of Appeal could not assume that Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi was unqualified in this respect, especially since the trial judge described Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s entire testimony&nbsp;— in which she defended her post‑injection qualifications&nbsp;— as credible (C.Q., at paras.&nbsp;425‑29). In other words, while a conviction for manslaughter was undoubtedly reasonable in this case, it was not so inevitable as to justify the measure ordered by the Court of Appeal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

She also applied the wrong standard of proof concerning the <i>mens rea</i> of manslaughter, since she required objective foreseeability of the risk of death rather than of the risk of bodily harm. Finally, the judge erred in considering Ms.&nbsp;Javanmardi’s professional training when assessing the objective nature of the risk posed by the injection. Those errors, whose effect is to invalidate most of the legal conclusions reached on the essential elements of the offence of manslaughter, had a sufficient impact. In light of their number and scope, I am of the view that the analysis must be carried out again for both charges.</p>

But this does not mean that one of them must be dropped at this stage, especially since criminal negligence causing death, as the more serious offence, is usually the charge that will stand (<i>R.&nbsp;v. J.F.</i>, 2008 SCC 60, [2008] 3&nbsp;S.C.R. 215, at para.&nbsp;13). The order for a new trial therefore applies to both.</p>
