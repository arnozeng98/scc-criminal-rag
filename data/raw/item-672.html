text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%"><i>Per</i> Dickson C.J. and Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Cory and McLachlin JJ.:&nbsp; It would be inappropriate for this Court to reconsider its decision in <i>O'Brien</i> here with a view to overturning the doctrine of "double intent".&nbsp; The Crown was aware that the defence would rely upon the principle of double intent and yet did not indicate at any time prior to or at the trial or on appeal, that it might eventually challenge the correctness of the decision.&nbsp; A challenge to the <i>O'Brien</i> decision at this late date would be unfair to the appellant.</p>

text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">The accused does not have an absolute right to be present at a hearing considering the dismissal of a juror for health reasons.&nbsp; He or she, however, should not be lightly deprived of the right to be tried by a jury of twelve persons and of the right to be present throughout the trial.&nbsp; Finally, the trial judge might advise counsel in court and in the presence of the accused of the nature of the health or hardship problem and invite counsel to make submissions if they so wished.&nbsp; The process need not necessarily take on all the trappings of a formal hearing.&nbsp; The Sheriff's officer's report and the call to the trial judge from the juror's doctor had nothing to do with establishing the accused's guilt or innocence and so did not constitute a part of the trial requiring his presence.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">Crown counsel's personal opinion as to the veracity of the witnesses was improper and it would have been preferable if the trial judge had so advised the jury.&nbsp; The effects of these unfortunate remarks were sufficiently overcome by the trial judge's instruction to the jury that it was their exclusive province to make findings of fact and, therefore, to assess the credibility of witnesses.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">The trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury as to the restricted use that they could make of the evidence of the appellant's allegedly immoral or criminal conduct.&nbsp; Evidence of an accused's bad character should, as a general rule, be considered only on the issue of the accused's general credibility and not as a basis for determining guilt or innocence.</p>

O'Brien</i>, [1954] S.C.R. 666.&nbsp; Neither before the Court of Appeal nor at trial did the Crown indicate that it would question the correctness of this decision.</p>

Hertrich, Stewart and Skinner</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510, recognized that this fundamental right was based upon two precepts.&nbsp; First, an accused has the right to hear the entire case made out against him so that full answer and defence can be made.&nbsp; Second, the concepts of fairness and openness are values fundamental to the criminal justice system.&nbsp; The presence of the accused is required at all stages of the trial to afford him or her an opportunity of acquiring first-hand knowledge of all the proceedings.&nbsp; It would thus seem that the accused should be present when the decision is made to discharge a juror for reasons of health.&nbsp; Yet, although that may be the preferable procedure, it is not absolute.&nbsp; Some proceedings undertaken in the absence of the accused may be properly excused.</p>

Barrow</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694, particularly at pp. 706-7.</p>

It may have become apparent from the transcript of the evidence of Gonzalez taken on commission before he was granted immunity and testified at the trial.&nbsp; In any event, it was made clear to the Crown years before the commencement of the trial that Chambers would be putting forward his defence of double intent.&nbsp; Thus the defence could not be considered to have been recently concocted.</p>

text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">It has as well been recognized that since there is a right to silence, it would be a snare and a delusion to caution the accused that he need not say anything in response to a police officer's question but nonetheless put in evidence that the accused clearly exercised his right and remained silent in the face of a question which suggested his guilt.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Robertson</i> (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 385 (Ont. C.A.), this very issue arose and the Court considered whether a police officer's accusation and the subsequent silence of an accused could be admitted in evidence.&nbsp; Dubin J.A., as he then was, dissenting in part, stated at p. 395:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:1.0in;line-height:200%">In my opinion the purported resumé of the facts as stated by Inspector Lyle, coupled with the response of "nothing", after being cautioned, was so highly prejudicial that I am not satisfied that the learned trial Judge's instructions to the jury could erase the prejudicial effect which that evidence would have on the jury.&nbsp; I cannot help but feel that most juries would assume that an innocent man would be prompted to deny any false accusations against him, and his failure to do so would tend to prove belief in the truth of the accusations.</p>

inter-ideograph;text-indent:1.0in;line-height:200%">In the absence of any issue raised by the defence, the mere silence of an accused during police interrogation cannot be said to advance the case for the Crown.&nbsp; It cannot be a step on the way to the proof of the accused's guilt.&nbsp; It, therefore, becomes, in my opinion, irrelevant to any issue at trial.&nbsp; To prove as part of the Crown's case the fact that the accused has exercised his common law right to remain silent would constitute silence a trap if his silence is placed in evidence against him at his trial.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%">It was also of great importance to Martin J.A. that the trial judge in that case had, immediately after he admitted the statement and again in his charge, instructed the jury in the clearest of terms that the fact that the accused had remained silent did not lend itself to any adverse inference and could not be used as an inference against him.&nbsp; It was because of the relevance of the statements and the clear warnings given on two occasions by the trial judge that Martin J.A. admitted the statement.</p>

Symonds</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; In that case the Crown led evidence that the accused had refused to say anything to the police after he had been cautioned.&nbsp; Later, during the cross-examination of the accused, the Crown repeatedly asked him why he had not offered his innocent explanation of the events to the police prior to the trial.&nbsp; The trial judge did not instruct the jury that they should not draw any adverse inference from this evidence.&nbsp; At issue was whether the admission of the evidence and the failure of the trial judge to properly instruct the jury constituted a reversible error.&nbsp; At p. 227 Martin J.A. wrote:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

Robertson</i> (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 385, 29 C.R.N.S. 141.</p>

text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">The circumstances of this trial aggravated the effect of the omission.&nbsp; Based upon the judge's undertaking to charge with regard to the subject, counsel for the defence did not re-examine.&nbsp; That re-examination in itself might have had a significant effect.&nbsp; It would have demonstrated that the appellant had disclosed his proposed defence some years before the trial.&nbsp; The absence of the re-examination, coupled with the failure to give the requisite instructions on the subject, could only have resulted in a significant injustice.&nbsp; The jury were deprived of the evidence that would establish that the so-called double intent defence to which the "Kuko" evidence related was not of recent concoction.&nbsp; As a result of the Crown's cross-examination, the jury could well have been left with the erroneous impression that Chambers was under a duty to disclose the Kuko story to a person in authority.&nbsp; The failure to disclose a defence of alibi in a timely manner may be considered in assessing the credibility of that defence but that is a unique situation.&nbsp; As a general rule there is no obligation resting upon an accused person to disclose either the defence which will be presented or the details of that defence before the Crown has completed its case.&nbsp; There was clearly no obligation resting upon the appellant to disclose either his defence of double intent or the Kuko story to the Crown or anyone in authority.&nbsp; The failure to correct such an impression by direction from the trial judge rendered the right to silence a snare of silence for the appellant.&nbsp; Without any direction to ignore these questions and answers, it is impossible to say that the verdict would necessarily have been the same.</p>

(dissenting) -- I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my colleague Justice Cory and, with respect, I cannot agree with his disposition of this appeal.&nbsp; While I fully agree with his reasons on the first four issues which he thoroughly canvassed, I find myself unable to concur with my colleague's analysis and disposition of the last ground of appeal raised, which concerns the accused's allegation that his right to silence was violated and that such violation cannot be cured by the application of s. 613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, (now s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">On that issue, I adopt the reasoning of Esson J.A. (now C.J.S.C.) in the Court of Appeal (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 503.&nbsp; In the particular circumstances of this case, and in the context in which this matter arose, I agree that the accused was not unfairly prejudiced by the objectionable questioning and the absence of direction to the jury on this particular point.&nbsp; As Esson J.A. stated at p. 560:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph">The objectionable question, that as to why Chambers did not tell the authorities of the explanation as soon as he was arrested, was neatly placed in its proper context by Chamber's [<i>sic</i>] answer to the effect that as a lawyer he knew that it would be futile to talk to authorities who had just laid conspiracy charges and arrested him under those charges.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:1.0in;line-height:200%">There were, on the following day, one or two further questions touching on the failure to say anything after arrest but Crown counsel shortly desisted from that line of inquiry.&nbsp; When the jury came to deliberate more than a month later, it may have seen some significance in Chamber's [<i>sic</i>] own evidence in direct that he had not told anyone this strange story until shortly before the second trial.&nbsp; That was a proper matter for their consideration.&nbsp; But it was in my view beyond the bounds of reasonable possibility that the jury attached significance to the questions relating to silence after arrest.&nbsp; Given the great length of time, and the mounds of evidence and argument which had been piled up between the time of the offending question and the judge's charge, it may well have been an act of charity to the accused to say nothing.&nbsp; The fact that defence counsel made no objection to the judge's failure to give the promised direction is an indication that, by that stage, it had ceased to be anything like a live issue in the eyes of anyone.</p>
