While escorting the jurors out of the courtroom, a court officer asked the foreman what the jury‚Äôs verdict had been.&nbsp; The foreman replied, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding, guilty‚Äù.&nbsp; Within approximately seven to nine minutes after the announcement of the verdict in court, the trial judge was informed of the apparent error.&nbsp; An effort was made to locate the jurors.&nbsp; The foreman and another juror were found in the parking lot and brought back to the courthouse.&nbsp; The court officer called the remaining jurors at their homes, but was unable to reach two jurors.&nbsp; Approximately 25&nbsp;minutes after the discharge of the appellant, court resumed in order to clarify the verdict.&nbsp; In the presence of both counsel and one juror, the foreman confirmed that the verdict was intended to be guilty.&nbsp; The trial judge reconvened court the next day.&nbsp; The full jury and both counsel were present, but the accused was not.&nbsp; Each of the jurors testified that their verdict was ‚Äúguilty‚Äù.&nbsp; The trial judge concluded that he had jurisdiction to conduct a limited inquiry into what the actual verdict was and into whether the court had committed an error in recording the verdict.&nbsp; A temporary publication ban was imposed but two articles describing the incident were published in two widely read newspapers.&nbsp; Three days later, at the third inquiry, both the accused and the full jury were present.&nbsp; The court reporter testified that he originally recorded the foreman‚Äôs response as unclear but when he replayed the tape at normal speed, he heard ‚Äúguilty as charged‚Äù; playing the tape on more sophisticated audio equipment, he heard ‚Äúnot guilty as charged‚Äù and was prepared to certify the verdict as such.&nbsp; The trial judge then questioned the jury.&nbsp; The foreman testified that he had cleared his throat in announcing the verdict, and that he had in fact said ‚Äúguilty as charged‚Äù.&nbsp; Most of the jurors testified that they had heard something like ‚Äúguilty‚Äù, but one testified that she was unable to hear the foreman as he announced the verdict.&nbsp; The trial judge then asked each juror two questions regarding taint or bias.&nbsp; Nine jurors indicated that their testimony had not been influenced by the media or anyone else.&nbsp; Two jurors testified that they had read or heard things in the media about the case but had not been influenced.&nbsp; One juror started to allude to an item he had heard in the media about the case, but the trial judge cut him off before he could give a complete answer. </span></p>

Head</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 684, and held that he had the jurisdiction to change the recorded verdict from ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù to ‚Äúguilty as charged‚Äù.&nbsp; He found no air of reality to the suggestion that the jurors were or may have been tainted between the time when the verdict was announced and the time that the jurors were reconvened and testified the next morning.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused‚Äôs appeal, finding that the error in this case was an accidental slip.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Iacobucci, Major, Binnie and LeBel JJ.:&nbsp; <i>Head</i> cannot be distinguished from the present case.&nbsp; However, the evolving jurisprudence and policy concerns warrant developing an exception to the general rule enunciated in <i>Head</i> that a trial judge is <i>functus officio</i> and lacks jurisdiction to reconvene the jury to inquire into an alleged error in the verdict once the jury in a criminal trial has been discharged.&nbsp; A trial judge retains the limited and exceptional jurisdiction to recall the jury and conduct a narrow inquiry into the alleged error where the error does not require the jury to reconsider the verdict or continue its deliberations with a view to handing down additional verdicts.&nbsp; This type of error is not properly called ‚Äúclerical‚Äù or ‚Äúadministrative‚Äù, as those types of errors may be corrected by the judge without recalling the jury.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The first question that a trial judge must ask post-discharge is whether the error requires reconsideration of the verdict.&nbsp; If it does, the general rule in <i>Head </i>applies and there are no circumstances under which the judge will retain or otherwise possess jurisdiction to reconvene the jury and conduct an inquiry into the alleged error.&nbsp; If the error does not require the jury to reconsider its verdict, then the trial judge possesses jurisdiction to conduct an inquiry into whether the facts of the case disclose a reasonable apprehension of bias.&nbsp; In determining whether this apprehension is raised, the trial judge must consider all the relevant circumstances of the case, the most crucial circumstance usually being the dispersal of the jury and its probable effect on the minds of reasonable members of the public.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Where the trial judge concludes, post-discharge, that the facts raise a reasonable apprehension of bias, he should declare a mistrial if that is the necessary remedy to prevent a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; In making that order, the trial judge must consider the rights of the accused and the public, along with the effect of not ordering a mistrial on the administration of justice.&nbsp; On the other hand, if a mistrial is not necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice, then the trial judge should uphold the verdict as given at trial.&nbsp; Where, however, the trial judge concludes that there is no reasonable apprehension of bias, he must correct the error in the verdict; a mistrial is not available as a remedy.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The present case falls within the exception to the general rule in <i>Head</i>.&nbsp; The alleged error lay in the faulty transmission and recording of the verdict and, since this error did not involve reconsideration of the verdict, the trial judge had post-discharge jurisdiction to conduct an inquiry into the alleged error.&nbsp; However, the trial judge did not conduct the proper analysis.&nbsp; Instead of asking whether there was a reasonable apprehension in the minds of right-thinking, properly informed members of the public that the jurors might have been biased or influenced, the trial judge conducted an actual bias test.&nbsp; In this case,&nbsp; the length of time which elapsed between the delivery of the recorded verdict and the point at which the jury was reconvened was substantial; the accused was discharged from custody; the nature and the scope of the jury‚Äôs dispersal was extensive; and, lastly, the jurors were exposed to the reaction of the public to the recorded verdict during the period when they were absent from the courtroom and to the potentially prejudicial media coverage of this case which appeared before and after the temporary publication ban.&nbsp; When the proper test is applied and all the relevant circumstances are considered in context, there is no question that the facts, particularly the jury‚Äôs extensive and extended dispersal, establish a reasonable apprehension of bias.&nbsp; As a result, the trial judge did not possess the exceptional jurisdiction to correct the verdict.&nbsp; He retained only the remedial jurisdiction to declare a mistrial.&nbsp; He was therefore in error when he changed the verdict and registered a conviction. </span></p>

The trial judge‚Äôs jurisdiction to inquire as to whether the verdict was correctly recorded is based on the fact that the trial may not have been properly concluded.&nbsp; A verdict other than the intended unanimous verdict of the jury is a nullity.&nbsp; If, as here, the trial judge has a reasonable concern that the verdict might be a nullity, the trial should resume as if the verdict had not been rendered.&nbsp; The trial judge should determine whether the recorded verdict was in fact null and void and if not, the verdict should stand.&nbsp; If the recorded verdict was a nullity, it should be set aside and the trial should resume.&nbsp; The appropriate test is whether there is a ‚Äúreasonable apprehension of taint or bias‚Äù.&nbsp; If there is no reasonable apprehension of bias, then there is no perceived threat to the impartiality of the jury and the jury is in the same position as it was prior to the court recording the verdict.&nbsp; Under this approach, the jury is free to continue deliberations if necessary.&nbsp; If there has been a reasonable apprehension of bias, the trial judge‚Äôs only option is to declare a mistrial and to order a new trial ‚Äúon such terms as justice may require‚Äù.&nbsp; In this case, the extent of the jury‚Äôs dispersal established a reasonable apprehension of bias and the appropriate remedy is to order a new trial.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; There is agreement with Major J. that the strict rule in <i>Head</i> must be rejected in favour of a more refined and flexible analysis, and with the stated test for determining the limits of the exercise of post-discharge jurisdiction.&nbsp; However, whether a verdict can be corrected post-discharge is a highly fact-specific analysis which depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the probable reason for the initial mistake and the length of time which has elapsed between the original verdict and the moment the error is brought to the trial judge‚Äôs attention.&nbsp; While dispersal may, in some instances, provide the most compelling evidence on which the test will turn, it is not the deciding factor in a case where, as here, the evidence satisfactorily establishes error in carrying out the court‚Äôs recording of the jury‚Äôs true verdict and a failure to correct that error would not serve the administration of justice.</span></p>

S. (R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at para. 31 (quoting <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at p. 395, <i>per</i> de Grandpr√© J.

Andrews</i> (1985), 82 Cr. App. R. 148 (C.A.), at p. 154.&nbsp; Often, it will not be practical to use an essentially bright-line test of dispersal to determine whether a jury verdict can be corrected; as Lamer J. pointed out in <i>Head</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 700 (quoting <i>Wigmore on Evidence</i> (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8, at para. 2355):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">It has occasionally been said that this correction must be claimed before the jury are discharged, but this seems unsound because such errors are seldom ascertained until after the jury have separated and conversed out of court, and if the error is satisfactorily established, there can hardly be any fixed time to limit its correction.</p>

Williquette</i>, 526 N.W.2d 144 (Wis. 1995), concluded, at p. 151:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">It is not difficult, however, to imagine a scenario where an incorrect verdict transcription could result in a serious injustice.&nbsp; The public policy considerations of promoting a jury‚Äôs freedom of deliberation, the stability and finality of judgments and protecting jurors against annoyance and embarrassment are indeed noble and must be taken into account; however, these considerations may not completely trump the ascertainment of the ‚Äútruth‚Äù as actually found by the jury.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In the instance of an erroneously entered guilty verdict, it would be a serious injustice to allow an innocent person to remain in prison simply because members of the jury had separated or mingled with the public.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that the Attorney General would forego the holding of a new trial, given the limited inquiry concerning the verdict, and no certainty that a new trial would produce the same result.&nbsp; Even if bail were granted, the innocent person‚Äôs burden would be great.&nbsp; I believe that it is also society‚Äôs interest that those found guilty do not go free.</p>

(R.D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 58.&nbsp; To require a new trial or allow the incorrect verdict to stand in light of the totality of these circumstances would work a serious injustice to the interests of the state and the general public ‚Äúsince it forces the court to tell the jurors that despite the fact that they have dutifully carried out the oath that they had sworn to uphold by listening to [20] days of evidence and then rendering a unanimous and otherwise valid verdict, their decision must be ignored‚Äù: V. Maric, Annotation to <i>R. v. Burke </i>(2001), 41 C.R. (5th) 135, at p. 136.&nbsp; I have utmost faith in the public‚Äôs ability to understand the error that took place here and the need for flexibility on the part of judges to take appropriate steps to remedy errors of this nature.&nbsp; It strikes me that any confusion on the part of the public will stem from the decision to expend the Crown‚Äôs resources on another trial even though there is no reasonable apprehension of taint and no doubt that the jury‚Äôs true verdict was ‚Äúguilty‚Äù.</p>

Cinous</i>,&nbsp; [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, 2002 SCC 29.&nbsp; The trial judge conducted an extensive three-day inquiry in which all relevant persons, including the court reporter, the court officer, the registrar, the court constables, and all 12 members of the jury, were carefully examined.&nbsp; As Weiler J.A. noted in her reasons in the Court of Appeal, at para. 45:&nbsp; ‚ÄúThe trial judge ensured that the process in which he engaged was fair to the accused.&nbsp; Having regard to the fact the accused was not present [of his own accord] when some of the evidence was heard, he had the witnesses repeat all of the evidence to ensure that the appellant was not prejudiced.‚Äù&nbsp; In my view, the factors that the trial judge took into account, namely, the reason for the error, the manner in which it came to his attention, and the clear and unequivocal statements of the jurors that the verdict was ‚Äúguilty as charged‚Äù, favour dismissal.&nbsp; I am not persuaded that dispersal of the jury was the overriding factor that the trial judge should have considered.&nbsp; </span></p>

24.4pt">[T]he judge has a discretion whether to allow the alteration [to the verdict] to be made.&nbsp; In exercising that discretion he will, it goes without saying, take into account all the circumstances of the case; in particular the important considerations will be the length of time which has elapsed between the original verdict and the moment when the jury express their wish to alter it, the probable reason for the initial mistake, the necessity to ensure that justice is done not only to the defendant but also to the prosecution.&nbsp; The fact that the defendant has been discharged from custody is one of the factors but is not necessarily fatal to the judge‚Äôs discretion to alter the verdict to one of guilty.</p>

Barrow</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694, at p. 714).&nbsp; <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec647subsec1" target="_blank">Section 647(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> ensures that the jury remains sequestered, stating that the trial judge can permit the jury to separate only <u>prior</u> to entering deliberations and rendering the verdict. Section 647(4) contemplates a mistrial if this rule is violated.&nbsp; In addition, there are other safeguards, such as jury selection, the process that requires jurors to swear an oath to give a true verdict according to the evidence, and the judge‚Äôs instructions in the form of his or her charge to the jury.</p>

(R.D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 109-15.&nbsp; Courts should be reluctant when presented with a whisper of bias to immediately conclude that the system ensuring impartial decisions has failed; consequently, we should not be quick to find a biased jury unless there is evidence to support a reasonable apprehension of the allegation.</p>

There is evidence that defence counsel had spoken with two of the jurors in the hallway after the jury was discharged.&nbsp; Two constables at the court had discussed the verdict with the foreman and another juror before escorting them back to the courthouse for the first inquiry.</p>
