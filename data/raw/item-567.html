text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">This appeal raises the question of the existence and scope of the power of the police to search a person who has been lawfully arrested.&nbsp; The appellants, both officers with the Montréal Urban Community Police Department, stopped the vehicle driven by the respondent after the latter had violated a municipal by‑law.&nbsp; They proceeded to arrest him upon being informed by police headquarters that a warrant of committal for unpaid traffic fines had been issued against him in Municipal Court.&nbsp; Highly agitated and abusive, the respondent accompanied the officers to their car, where they carried out a "frisk" search:&nbsp; with the respondent's hands on the hood of the car and his legs spread, the officers patted him down.&nbsp; The respondent was then taken to the police station, where he filed an information against each of the police officers for common assault.&nbsp; At trial, the respondent argued that the police officers were not authorized to search him and that the search was an assault within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec245" target="_blank">s. 245<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>b</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The Summary Convictions Court judge dismissed the informations and this judgment was upheld by the Superior Court.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal in a majority judgment allowed the respondent's appeal and entered a verdict of guilty.&nbsp; <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">Section 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> was not invoked by the parties.</p>

text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">The exercise of the power to search is not however unlimited.&nbsp; First, this power does not impose a duty.&nbsp; The police have some discretion and, if satisfied that the law can be effectively and safely applied, they may see fit not to conduct a search.&nbsp; They must also be in a position to assess the circumstances of each case so as to determine whether a search meets the underlying objectives forming the basis of the right to search.&nbsp; Second, as regards these objectives, the search must be for a valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice ‑‑ such as the discovery of an object that may be a threat to the safety of the police, the accused or the public, or that may facilitate escape or act as evidence against the accused ‑‑ and the purpose of the search must not be unrelated to the objectives of the proper administration of justice.&nbsp; Third, the search must not be conducted in an abusive fashion, and in particular, the use of physical or psychological constraint should be proportionate to the objectives sought and the other circumstances of the situation.&nbsp; A search which does not meet these objectives could be characterized as unreasonable and unjustified at common law.</p>

Morrison</i> (1987), 20 O.A.C. 230.&nbsp; This authority is based on the need to disarm an accused and to discover evidence.&nbsp; In the course of custodial arrest an accused may be stripped.</p>

text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">In terms of applying the law, the ultimate purpose of criminal proceedings is to convict those found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Our system of criminal justice is based on the punishment of conduct that is contrary to the fundamental values of society, as statutorily enshrined in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and similar statutes.&nbsp; That is its primary purpose.&nbsp; The system depends for its legitimacy on the safe and effective performance of this function by the police.&nbsp; In the context of an arrest, these requirements entail at least two primary considerations.&nbsp; First, the process of arrest must be capable of ensuring that those arrested will come before the court.&nbsp; An individual who is arrested should not be able to evade the police before he is released in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure, otherwise the administration of justice will be brought into disrepute.&nbsp; In light of this consideration, a search of the accused for weapons or other dangerous articles is necessary as an elementary precaution to preclude the possibility of their use against the police, the nearby public or the accused himself.&nbsp; Incidents of this kind are not unknown.&nbsp; Further, the process of arrest must ensure that evidence found on the accused and in his immediate surroundings is preserved.&nbsp; The effectiveness of the system depends in part on the ability of peace officers to collect evidence that can be used in establishing the guilt of a suspect beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The legitimacy of the justice system would be but a mere illusion if the person arrested were allowed to destroy evidence in his possession at the time of the arrest.&nbsp; These interests have been recognized since the courts first considered the power to search; in <i>Dillon v.

Rep. 91a, 77 E.R. 194).&nbsp; Similarly, an invisible "fortress" was built bit by bit around each subject of the Empire and gradually any interference with individual freedom was seen as <i>prima facie</i> unlawful, the representatives of the State having the burden of establishing a legal basis for their actions: "no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except on the condition that he can support the legality of his action before a court of justice" (<i>Eleko v. Officer Administering the Government of Nigeria</i>, [1931] A.C. 662 (P.C.), at p. 670).&nbsp; This fundamental role of guardian of freedom and property continued and expanded with the advent of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> (<i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">It should be noted that all the Quebec courts have approached the evidence in this case on the basis that a "frisk" search is not necessarily incidental to a lawful arrest, but instead, depends on the existence of reasonable grounds.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">Despite the imposition of a standard higher than that required at common law, Judge Choquette of the Court of Summary Proceedings, the only judge to have seen and heard the witnesses, after considering whether the accused [TRANSLATION] "had reasonable grounds to make a search of the complainant", answered in the affirmative:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:1.0in">[TRANSLATION]&nbsp; Considering the circumstances of the case as a whole, the court feels that the police definitely had reasonable grounds that would justify them in lawfully making the arrest and search of the complainant, and that in view of the insults heaped on them by Mr. Cloutier they acted courteously.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:1.0in;line-height:200%">As regards the force used to do this, it does not seem excessive or disproportionate in view of the events.&nbsp; The accused made a "frisk" search of the complainant using no excessive violence or force.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">Barrette-Joncas J. of the Superior Court came to the same conclusion.&nbsp; Rothman J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal, took a similar view and accepted the trial judge's findings of fact and the conclusions drawn by him.&nbsp; The majority of the judges in the Court of Appeal seem to have taken a stricter approach to the facts.&nbsp; They concluded, contrary to the finding of the trial judge, that reasonable and probable grounds did not exist.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">Applying the legal standard to the facts of this case, the evidence indicates that the police considered that in light of all the circumstances it was necessary to search the respondent.&nbsp; The respondent's conduct, which the Court of Appeal judges characterized as "unpleasant" and "highly agitated and verbally abusive", was such as to arouse a concern in the police officers for safety and effectiveness objectives.&nbsp; Secondly, the evidence showed to my satisfaction that the police searched the respondent in pursuit of a valid objective, here, police safety in making a lawful arrest.&nbsp; As to this I will simply cite a passage from the opinion of Rothman J.A. in which he reproduces this part of the evidence (at p. 1484):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:1.0in">Among the reasons that would justify a personal search is the possibility that the person arrested might be armed and might endanger the officers arresting him.&nbsp; In this case, that was the only justification given by Constable Bédard:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:105.6pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:105.6pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph"><i>Q.</i>&nbsp; So now, Constable Bédard, what happened?&nbsp; You told Mr.&nbsp;Cloutier -- there was an exchange, which you have just described to the court -- what happened then?</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:105.6pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:1.0in;line-height:200%">Looking at the matter now, it would not be difficult to conclude that the police officers did not have any real reason to fear physical violence from Mr. Cloutier.&nbsp; But, on the evidence, it is clear that he was highly agitated and verbally abusive.&nbsp; The conclusion of the trial judge that it was Cloutier's conduct that made the situation as tense as it became is amply supported by the evidence.</p>

<div class="WordSection33">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">Furthermore, the fact that there existed a general directive in the police department to search an arrested suspect for any weapon or object potentially dangerous to the policemen has no bearing on this case, since the evidence of the police officers who conducted the search was that they exercised their independent discretion taking into account all the circumstances of this case.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">I accordingly consider that, as an incident to the lawful arrest of the respondent, the frisk search was justified, and accordingly Judge Choquette made no error in dismissing the informations for assault brought against the appellants.&nbsp; This is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:200%">On the question of costs, the Summary Convictions Court may in its discretion order the payment of the defendant's costs against the informant when the information is dismissed (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec744" target="_blank">s. 744<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>).&nbsp; In the case at bar none of the Quebec courts applied this provision.&nbsp; Therefore each party paid its own costs in the lower courts.&nbsp; The appellants did not argue strongly on this point.&nbsp; In the circumstances, I feel it is proper not to award costs.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
