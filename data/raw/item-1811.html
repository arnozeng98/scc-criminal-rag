 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In the context of the admission of fresh evidence on appeal, the concepts of admissibility and probative value overlap.&nbsp; To be admissible, fresh evidence must be relevant and credible and, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.&nbsp; The probative value of fresh evidence must thus be considered in order to determine whether it is admissible on appeal.&nbsp; To facilitate determination of the probative value of fresh evidence, the party challenging it should test it by making a formal motion to the court of appeal and explaining how it wishes to proceed.&nbsp; The court of appeal may in this regard exercise all the powers set out in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec683" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;683<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Failure by a party to test fresh evidence does not relieve a court of appeal from applying the criteria established in <i>Palmer</i>.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The strict rules of a trial do not apply to a sentencing hearing, since to determine the appropriate sentence the judge must have as much information as possible about the accused.&nbsp; The <i>Palmer</i> criteria do not compromise the more flexible nature of the rules, since the criteria concerning the admission of fresh evidence on appeal do not relate to the sources and types of evidence.&nbsp; The purpose of the due diligence criterion is to protect the interests and the administration of justice and to preserve the role of appeal courts.&nbsp; Before admitting new opinion evidence on appeal, it may be necessary to determine the basis of that opinion and to establish whether the facts on which the opinion is based have been proven and are credible.&nbsp; Whether or not consent is given, the production of fresh evidence on appeal is possible only with the leave of the court of appeal.&nbsp; The court of appeal may properly take into account the fact that the Crown has consented or that admission is uncontested particularly when assessing the relevance, credibility and probative value of fresh evidence.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In this case, the majority of the Court of Appeal found that the two reports were admissible because they provided greater detail or shed additional light on the evidence adduced at trial.&nbsp; These grounds are inadequate to justify the admission of the reports, since they could justify the admission of a very broad range of additional evidence on appeal, which would be contrary to the <i>Palmer</i> criteria and the limited role of appellate courts in respect of sentencing.&nbsp; The reports should not have been admitted in evidence, since their probative value was not such that they might have affected the result if they had been adduced at trial with the other evidence.&nbsp; The probative value of an expert opinion depends on the amount and quality of admissible evidence on which it relies.&nbsp; Both the psychologist and the psychiatrist, whose report also does not meet the due diligence criterion, based their opinions on a version of the facts that was not established or adopted at trial.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; The Court of Appeal was entitled to admit the reports.&nbsp; The trial judge fundamentally mischaracterized the principal crime of which the accused had been convicted in determining the just and appropriate sentence, with the result that the Court of Appeal was, for all intents and purposes, required to sentence afresh.&nbsp; In these specific circumstances, it was for the Court of Appeal to equip itself, pursuant to its broad statutory discretion under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec683subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;683(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, with whatever evidence it deemed fit and necessary to decide the question of sentence.&nbsp; In view of the fundamental error committed by the trial judge, the principles governing the admission of fresh evidence in appeals against sentence articulated by the majority are not germane to the disposition of this appeal.&nbsp; Further, the majority’s stringent application of <i>Lavallee</i> was disagreed with.&nbsp; The nature of the sentencing process, and of the statutory rules that govern it, contemplate that the sentencing court should have the benefit of the fullest possible information concerning the background of the offender, from the widest array of sources.&nbsp; It is therefore inappropriate to tie the probative value of evidence tendered under these rules to the probative value of evidence proffered at trial, and thus, more specifically, to assess the weight of an expert opinion on the basis of the quantity and quality of non‑hearsay evidence introduced to support that opinion.&nbsp; A sentencing court must be entitled to receive and rely on any credible and trustworthy evidence which assists it in obtaining as complete an understanding of the offender as possible.&nbsp; The extent to which evidence presented on sentencing conflicts with the facts upon which the conviction was founded is a matter for the sentencing court to take into consideration, but is not, as such, a matter for exclusion of the evidence in question.&nbsp; Here it was open to the Court of Appeal to find both reports sufficiently credible and trustworthy to assist in the development of a fuller picture of the accused, based as they were on the experts’ face‑to‑face psychological assessment and evaluation of the former.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">(1)&nbsp; The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases: see <i>McMartin</i> <i>v.</i> <i>The Queen</i>.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">(2)&nbsp; The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">(4)&nbsp; It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In <i>R.</i> <i>v. M. (P.S.)</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), at p.&nbsp;410, Doherty J.A. wrote the following concerning these principles:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It is desirable that due diligence remain only one factor and its absence, particularly in criminal cases, should be assessed in light of other circumstances.&nbsp; If the evidence is compelling and the interests of justice require that it be admitted then the failure to meet the test should yield to permit its admission.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This passage clearly shows that the due diligence criterion must be applied flexibly.&nbsp; In my view, it is not necessary to make it more flexible in the context of appeals from sentence.&nbsp; While due diligence is not a necessary prerequisite for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal, it is an important factor that must be taken into account in determining whether it is in the interests of justice to admit or exclude fresh evidence.&nbsp; As Doherty&nbsp;J.A. said in <i>M.

(C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para.&nbsp;91.&nbsp; Despite the fresh evidence, the sentencing judge, unlike the appeal judge, has the benefit of being able to directly assess the other evidence, the testimony and the submissions of the parties, as well as being familiar with the needs and current conditions of and in the community where the crime was committed:&nbsp; see <i>M. (C.A.)</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para.&nbsp;91.&nbsp; Furthermore, appeal courts are not the appropriate forum in which to determine questions of fact, and they should do so only when the fresh evidence presents certain characteristics such as would justify expanding their traditional role.&nbsp; This Court has already identified those characteristics, in <i>Palmer.</i>&nbsp; In my view, whether the appeal relates to a verdict or a sentence, the criteria laid down by this Court in <i>Palmer</i> are the criteria that are to be applied where a court of appeal is determining whether to admit fresh evidence.</p>

(2d) 438 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Hogan</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R.</i> <i>v. Irwin</i> (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 423 (Alta. C.A.); <i>R. v. Langille</i> (1987), 77 N.S.R. (2d) 224 (C.A.); <i>R.</i> <i>v.

C.A.).&nbsp; Some courts of appeal have maintained that the criteria to be applied are the same, whether the appeal relates to a verdict or a sentence: see <i>Hogan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;&nbsp;449, and <i>Edwards</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;27.&nbsp; Others have stated that the rules relating to the admission of fresh evidence were applied more flexibly or informally in the context of an appeal from a sentence: see <i>Hogan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;453; <i>Langille</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Edwards</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;28; and <i>Riley</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;283.&nbsp; However, a careful review of the jurisprudence reveals that, far from applying different criteria, courts of appeal have invariably applied the criteria set out in <i>Palmer</i>, whether expressly or by implication (for examples of the application of the due diligence criterion, see <i>Lockwood</i>, <i>Hogan</i>, <i>Irwin</i>, <i>Langille</i>, <i>Edwards</i> and <i>Mesgun</i>; for examples of the application of the relevance criterion, see <i>Edwards</i> and <i>Lemay</i>; and for an example of the application of the criteria relating to credibility and effect on the result, see <i>Langille</i>).&nbsp; In addition, as I have already explained, it is neither desirable nor really possible to relax the rule laid down in <i>Palmer</i>, in view of its inherent flexibility and the requirements associated with the interests of justice.</p>

(P.S.)</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

Ruby, <i>Sentencing</i> (5th&nbsp;ed. 1999), at p.&nbsp;607.&nbsp; In the case at bar, the appellant consented to the production of the report by Jacques Bigras, the psychologist.&nbsp; It is important to bear in mind that whether or not consent is given, the production of fresh evidence on appeal is possible only with the leave of the court of appeal: <i>Hogan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;&nbsp;448.&nbsp; Evidence relating to events subsequent to the sentence or an accused’s rehabilitation process normally meet the due diligence criterion, since by their very nature they were not available at the time of sentencing.&nbsp; However, in order to be found to be admissible, the evidence must also satisfy the other criteria, particularly the criterion relating to the likelihood that the result would be affected.&nbsp; The court of appeal may properly take into account the fact that the Crown has consented or that admission is uncontested particularly when assessing the relevance, credibility and probative value of fresh evidence.</p>
