(dissenting):&nbsp; The Court of Appeal was correct in overturning the conditional sentence in this case.&nbsp; The sentence was inappropriate both because the precondition that the accused not endanger the safety of the community was not satisfied and because the conditional sentencing regime does not contemplate serving a sentence in a locked psychiatric unit of a hospital.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In assessing whether the accused is a danger to the community, the court must consider the following two factors:&nbsp; (1) the risk of the offender re‚Äëoffending; and (2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re‚Äëoffence.&nbsp; In assessing the risk of re‚Äëoffence in this case, the accused‚Äôs history of weapons offences must be considered.&nbsp; The record demonstrates that the accused was already subject to a prohibition from possessing firearms, ammunition and explosives at the time that he committed the offences in question.&nbsp; Nevertheless, by the time the accused was apprehended, he had amassed a large arsenal of highly volatile explosives capable of injuring many people and leading to substantial property damage.&nbsp; The medical evidence also establishes that the accused has been engaged in dangerous activity in the past even while undergoing treatment.&nbsp; Unfortunately, whether the accused is sentenced to a prison term or treated at a psychiatric hospital, he will likely remain a danger even when his sentence is complete.&nbsp; While the accused would be subject to supervision during the term of his conditional sentence, the evidence points to a risk of re‚Äëoffending despite such supervision and the availability of programs.&nbsp; Moreover, the sentence order did not ensure that the accused remained under maximum security at the hospital throughout the entire period of his sentence.&nbsp; The accused was to reside in a locked psychiatric treatment unit of the hospital until a consensus was reached among psychiatrists that he could be transferred into other treatment facilities.&nbsp; Since no evidence was tendered regarding the level of security at those other facilities, there is no way of ensuring that there would not be a risk of re‚Äëoffence once the accused was released.&nbsp; Further, even if it were accepted that the risk of re‚Äëoffence is only minimal, the gravity of the potential harm that would ensue if the accused were to re‚Äëoffend precludes a conditional sentence in and of itself.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Even if it were to be concluded that the accused does not represent a danger to the community, the conditional sentencing regime does not contemplate serving a sentence in a locked psychiatric unit as a condition of the sentence.&nbsp; A conditional sentence which confines an offender to a psychiatric institution is distinct from a treatment order envisioned in s.&nbsp;742.3(2)(<i>e</i>).&nbsp; Nor can s.&nbsp;742.3(2)(<i>f</i>), under which the court may impose ‚Äúsuch other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable‚Äù,&nbsp; be used to confine an individual to a psychiatric hospital.&nbsp; While the conditional sentence may incorporate some&nbsp; restrictive conditions such as house arrest and curfews with non‚Äëcustodial measures, offenders serving a conditional sentence are not confined to an institution but are meant to continue working, attending school, and participating in treatment programs.&nbsp; This Court‚Äôs decision in <i>Proulx</i> makes it evident that conditional sentences are meant as an alternative to incarceration and not as a sentence to any type of locked institution subsequent to which the offender would have to be reintegrated into the community.&nbsp; This view of the philosophy behind the conditional sentencing regime is buttressed by the recent appellate decisions which hold that ‚Äúblended‚Äù sentences, where the first part of the sentence is served in custody and the latter part is a conditional sentence under supervision in the community, are illegal and contrary to the underlying purpose of the conditional sentencing regime.&nbsp; A review of the legislative history of the conditional sentencing provisions also suggests that Parliament intended that conditional sentences be non‚Äëinstitutional in nature and that supervision in the community was not meant to be equivalent to confinement in an institution.&nbsp; The usual methods of confining a person to a hospital in the criminal context are as a condition of parole, or through a ruling that the person is not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder.&nbsp; Unlike a person held not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, a person with a mental disability who is being sentenced is criminally responsible for his or her actions.&nbsp; The principle of ‚Äúproportionality‚Äù, codified in s.&nbsp;718.1 of the <i>Code</i>, dictates that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.&nbsp; Here the accused possessed a culpable state of mind, and his sentence should reflect this.</span></p>

The following day, when the [appellant] did not appear for work, the police were notified. The police responded to his residence and noted that the apartment was in state of disarray with PVC pipes, electrical components, wires and transistors on the livingroom floor and kitchen table. A search warrant was obtained. The apartment contained numerous electrical component systems, parts, and an electronic technician‚Äëtype workbench complete with tools and diagnostic equipment.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The conditional sentence was specifically enacted as a new sanction designed to achieve both of Parliament‚Äôs objectives.&nbsp; The conditional sentence is a meaningful alternative to incarceration for less serious and non-dangerous offenders.&nbsp; The offenders who meet the criteria of s. 742.1 will serve a sentence under strict surveillance in the community instead of going to prison.&nbsp; These offenders‚Äô liberty will be constrained by conditions to be attached to the sentence, as set out in s. 742.3 of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; In case of breach of conditions, the offender will be brought back before a judge, pursuant to s. 742.6.&nbsp; If an offender cannot provide a reasonable excuse for breaching the conditions of his or her sentence, the judge may<span style="font-family:Shruti"> order</span> <span style="font-family:Shruti">him or</span> her to serve the remainder of the sentence in jail, as it was intended by Parliament that there be a real threat of incarceration to increase compliance with the conditions of the sentence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The conditional sentence incorporates some elements of non-custodial measures and some others of incarceration.&nbsp; Because it is served in the community, it will generally be more effective than incarceration at achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations to the victim and community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender.&nbsp; However, <u>it is also a punitive sanction capable of achieving the objectives of denunciation and deterrence</u>.&nbsp; It is this punitive aspect that distinguishes the conditional sentence from probation, and it is<span style="font-family:Shruti"> to</span> this issue that I now turn.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">This is not to say that the conditional sentence is a lenient punishment or that it does not provide significant denunciation and deterrence, or that a conditional sentence can never be as harsh as <span style="font-family:Shruti">incarceration.&nbsp; As this</span> Court stated in <i>Gladue</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 72:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">... in our view a sentence focussed on restorative justice is not necessarily a ‚Äúlighter‚Äù punishment.&nbsp; Some proponents of restorative justice argue that when it is combined with probationary conditions <span style="font-family:Shruti">it</span> may in some circumstances impose a greater burden on the offender than a custodial sentence.</p>

Shruti">the focus</span> of the analysis at this point should clearly be on the risk posed by the individual offender <u>while serving his sentence in the community</u>‚Äù (emphasis added)<span style="font-family:Shruti">.</span>&nbsp; The danger to the community is then evaluated by reference to: (1) the risk&nbsp; of re-offence; and (2) the gravity of the damage in the event of re-offence.&nbsp; See <i>Proulx</i>, at para. 69.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The risk of re-offence should also be assessed in light of the conditions attached to the sentence. Where an offender might pose some risk of endangering the safety of the community, it is possible that this risk be reduced to a minimal one by the imposition of appropriate conditions to the sentence: see <i>Wismayer</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at p. 32; <i>Brady</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 62; <i>Maheu</i>,<i> supra</i>, at p. 374 <span style="font-family:Shruti">C.C.C.</span>&nbsp; Indeed, this is contemplated by s. 742<span style="font-family:Shruti">.3</span>(2)(<i>f</i>), which allows the court to include as optional conditions ‚Äúsuch other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable... for securing the good conduct of the offender and for preventing a repetition by the offender of the same offence or the commission of other offences‚Äù.&nbsp; For example, a judge may wish to impose a conditional sentence with a treatment order on an offender with a drug addiction, notwithstanding the fact that the offender has a lengthy criminal record linked to this addiction, provided the judge is confident that there is a <span style="font-family:Shruti">good chance</span> of rehabilitation and that the level of supervision will be sufficient to ensure that the offender complies with the sentence.</p>

Ct. J., it must be emphasized that the sentence order did not ensure that the appellant remained under maximum security at the Alberta Hospital throughout the entire period of his sentence.&nbsp; Rather, the sentence imposed contemplated release into the general community.&nbsp; Indeed, the appellant was to reside in a locked psychiatric treatment unit of the Alberta Hospital until a consensus was reached among psychiatrists that the appellant could be transferred out of the locked unit and into other treatment facilities.&nbsp; Implicit in Chrumka Prov. Ct. J.‚Äôs sentence was therefore a delegation to the appellant‚Äôs physicians to decide when and under what conditions the appellant would be released from the locked psychiatric ward. <span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;There was no evidence regarding the level of security at those other facilities.&nbsp; In fact, the appellant tendered no evidence regarding the security of these other treatment facilities, the extent to which they may afford contact with members of the public, or how long a period the appellant would remain in the locked unit prior to being released to these other facilities.&nbsp; There is thus no way of ensuring that there would not be a risk of re-offence once the appellant was released.&nbsp; Dr. Cadsky testified that, although this had not been the appellant‚Äôs style in the past, if the appellant were in the community, it is possible that he might re-offend before Dr. Cadsky would have an opportunity to intervene.&nbsp; Thus, I am unable to accept the appellant and the AMHB‚Äôs submissions that the appellant has been disadvantaged solely on the basis of perceived risk, stigma or stereotype.&nbsp; The evidence in this case demonstrates, to the contrary, that the risk is not ‚Äúperceived‚Äù at all but very real.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The above passage demonstrates that the sentencing judge considered those in the prison setting to be part of the public.&nbsp; In so doing, he acknowledged that ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù also includes the public.&nbsp; However, the whole conditional sentencing regime posits community versus prisons and a sentencing judge should not be considering the safety of those in prison when determining whether the conditions precedent for the imposition of a conditional sentence have been met.&nbsp; As I stated earlier, the question to be addressed in this case is not whether the appellant and the public would be better off if the appellant‚Äôs sentence is served in a hospital, but whether the conditions for the imposition of a conditional sentence have been satisfied in the circumstances of this case.</p>

Ct.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">While the conditional sentence may incorporate some restrictions on free movement with non-custodial measures (<i>Proulx</i>, at para. 22), clearly, the above passage indicates that offenders serving a conditional sentence are not confined to an institution but are meant to continue working, attending school, and participating in treatment programs.</p>

Ct. J. was not consistent with <i>Proulx</i> in this regard.&nbsp; Indeed, the record in this case is replete with references to a slow process of reintegration into the community subsequent to the appellant being released from the psychiatric ward which could occur at any time upon consensus of the appellant‚Äôs physicians.</p>

C-26, and ss. 14-19 of the <i>Correctional Institution Regulations</i>, Alta. Reg. 138/77, provide for the transfer of inmates who require treatment to hospitals pursuant to the <i>Mental Health Act</i>, S.A. 1988, c.

British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at para. 41, that a disposition under s. 672.54 is not punitive in nature but is intended to provide the accused with treatment opportunities.&nbsp; The idea is that both the accused and society are better served by stabilizing the accused‚Äôs mental condition, thereby reducing the threat to public safety (<i>Winko</i>, at para. 39).&nbsp; The restrictions on the accused‚Äôs liberty are legitimate if the accused poses a significant danger to the safety of the community.&nbsp; In fact, the unit of the Alberta Hospital, where the appellant was sentenced to reside, is a maximum security facility which also houses patients who have been found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder.</p>

Ct. J.&nbsp; While there is a pressing need to address the sentencing regime and its application to psychiatrically disordered offenders, the legislation should not be judicially rewritten in order to do so.</p>

C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, requiring an offender to undergo treatment in a closed psychiatric facility, provided that such an order is reasonable in the circumstances, and consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing.&nbsp; In such a situation, I am of the view that the discretion afforded to sentencing judges under s. 742.3(2)(<i>f</i>) of the <i>Code </i>is wide enough to include sentences that require psychiatric care in a hospital setting.&nbsp; On these points, I agree with Arbour J.</p>

Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5, which held that, before a conditional sentence may be ordered, the risk of the offender‚Äôs re-offending and the gravity of the damage that such re-offence could entail must be considered.&nbsp; I agree with Bastarache J. that these conditions were not met in this case.</p>
