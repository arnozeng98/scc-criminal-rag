 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasons tell the parties affected by the decision why the decision was made.&nbsp; As Lord Denning remarked, on the desirability of giving reasons, “by so doing, [the judge] gives proof that he has heard and considered the evidence and arguments that have been adduced before him on each side: and also that he has not taken extraneous considerations into account”: <i>The Road to Justice </i>(1955), at p. 29.&nbsp; In this way, they attend to the dignity interest of the accused, an interest at the heart of post-World War II jurisprudence:&nbsp; M. Liston, “‘Alert, alive and sensitive’: <i>Baker</i>, the Duty to Give Reasons, and the Ethos of Justification in Canadian Public Law”, in D. Dyzenhaus, ed., <i>The Unity of Public Law</i> (2004), 113, at p. 121.&nbsp; No less important is the function of explaining to the Crown and to the victims of crime why a conviction was or was not entered.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasons provide public accountability of the judicial decision; justice is not only done, but is seen to be done.&nbsp; Thus, it has been said that the main object of a judgment “is not only to do but to seem to do justice”: Lord Macmillan, “The Writing of Judgments” (1948), 26 <i>Can. Bar Rev. </i>491, at p. 491.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasons permit effective appellate review.&nbsp; A clear articulation of the factual findings facilitates the correction of errors and enables appeal courts to discern the inferences drawn, while at the same time inhibiting appeal courts from making factual determinations “from the lifeless transcript of evidence, with the increased risk of factual error”: M. Taggart, “Should Canadian judges be legally required to give reasoned decisions in civil cases” (1983), 33 <i>U.T.L.J.</i> 1, at p. 7.&nbsp; Likewise, appellate review for an error of law will be greatly aided where the trial judge has articulated her understanding of the legal principles governing the outcome of the case.&nbsp; Moreover, parties and lawyers rely on reasons in order to decide whether an appeal is warranted and, if so, on what grounds.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In addition, reasons help ensure fair and accurate decision making; the task of articulating the reasons directs the judge’s attention to the salient issues and lessens the possibility of overlooking or under‑emphasizing important points of fact or law.&nbsp; As one judge has said:&nbsp; “Often a strong impression that, on the basis of the evidence, the facts are thus-and-so gives way when it comes to expressing that impression on paper” (<i>United States v. Forness</i>, 125 F.2d 928 (2d Cir. 1942), at p. 942).&nbsp; Finally, reasons are a fundamental means of developing the law uniformly, by providing guidance to future courts in accordance with the principle of <i>stare decisis</i>.&nbsp; Thus, the observation in H.&nbsp;Broom’s <i>Constitutional Law Viewed in Relation to Common Law, and Exemplified by Cases</i> (2nd ed. 1885), at pp. 147-48:&nbsp; “A public statement of the reasons for a judgment is due to the suitors and to the community at large — is essential to the establishment of fixed intelligible rules, and for the development of law as a science.”&nbsp; In all these ways, reasons instantiate the rule of law and support the legitimacy of the judicial system.</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>The critical functions of reasons in letting the parties know the reasons for conviction, in providing public accountability and in providing a basis for appeal were emphasized in <i>Sheppard</i>.&nbsp; At the same time, <i>Sheppard</i> acknowledged the constraints of time and the general press of business in criminal trial courts and affirmed that the degree of detail required may vary with the circumstances and the completeness of the record.</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In summary, the law has progressed to the point where it may now be said with confidence that a trial judge on a criminal trial where the accused’s innocence is at stake has a duty to give reasons.&nbsp; The remaining question is more difficult: What, in the context of a particular case, constitutes <i>sufficient</i> reasons?</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>It follows that courts of appeal considering the sufficiency of reasons should read them as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered (see <i>Sheppard</i>, at paras. 46 and 50; <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at p. 524).</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[17]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>These purposes are fulfilled if the reasons, read in context, show why the judge decided as he or she did.&nbsp; The object is not to show <i>how</i> the judge arrived at his or her conclusion, in a “watch me think” fashion.&nbsp; It is rather to show <i>why</i> the judge made that decision.&nbsp; The decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Morrissey</i> predates the decision of this Court establishing a duty to give reasons in <i>Sheppard</i>.&nbsp; But the description in <i>Morrissey</i> of the object of a trial judge’s reasons is apt.&nbsp; Doherty J.A. in <i>Morrissey</i>, at p. 525, puts it this way: “In giving reasons for judgment, the trial judge is attempting to tell the parties <u>what</u> he or she has decided and <u>why</u> he or she made that decision” (emphasis added).&nbsp; What is required is a logical connection between the “what” — the verdict — and the “why” — the basis for the verdict. The foundations of the judge’s decision must be discernable, when looked at in the context of the evidence, the submissions of counsel and the history of how the trial unfolded.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">A trial judge’s reasons cannot be read or analyzed as if they were an instruction to a jury.&nbsp; Instructions provide a road map to direct lay jurors on their journey toward a verdict.&nbsp; Reasons for judgment are given after a trial judge has reached the end of that journey and explain why he or she arrived at a particular conclusion.&nbsp; <u>They are not intended to be, and should not be read, as a verbalization of the entire process engaged in by the trial judge in reaching a verdict.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>The judge need not expound on matters that are well settled, uncontroversial or understood and accepted by the parties.&nbsp; This applies to both the law and the evidence.&nbsp; Speaking of the law, Doherty J.A. states in <i>Morrissey</i>, at p. 524:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Where a case turns on the application of well-settled legal principles to facts as found after a consideration of conflicting evidence, the trial judge is not required to expound upon those legal principles to demonstrate to the parties, much less to the Court of Appeal, that he or she was aware of and applied those principles.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Similarly, the trial judge need not expound on evidence which is uncontroversial, or detail his or her finding on each piece of evidence or controverted fact, so long as the findings linking the evidence to the verdict can be logically discerned.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

The parties know the basis for the decision.&nbsp; The public knows what has been decided and why.&nbsp; And the appellate court can judge whether the trial judge took a wrong turn and erred. The authorities are constant on this point.&nbsp;</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[42]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In this case, the Court of Appeal faulted the trial judge principally for not giving sufficiently precise reasons for accepting the complainant’s evidence and rejecting the accused’s evidence, as well as for not stating precisely what evidence he accepted and rejected in respect of each of the counts on which he found the accused guilty.&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>Dinardo</i>, the reasons of the trial judge were criticized for failing to engage in a detailed discussion of the process of assessing reasonable doubt recommended in <i>&nbsp;W.&nbsp;(D.).</i>&nbsp; In both cases, the issue was how much detail the trial judge’s reasons are required to provide — in this case on the facts, in <i>Dinardo</i> on the law.</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Just as it is reasonable to infer that the trial judge seized the import of the evidence, it is generally reasonable to infer that the trial judge understands the basic principles of criminal law at issue in the trial.&nbsp; Indeed, for this reason it has repeatedly been held that “[t]rial judges are presumed to know the law with which they work day in and day out”:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Burns</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656, at p. 664, where the Court rejected the notion of a positive duty on trial judges to demonstrate that they have appreciated every aspect of the relevant evidence. The trial judge is not required to recite pages of “boilerplate” or review well-settled authorities in detail, and failure to do so is not an error of law.&nbsp; As Binnie J. pointed out in <i>Sheppard</i>, at para. 55, point 7:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, 2005 SCC 25, and stated in <i>Gagnon </i>(at para. 20), “in the absence of a palpable and overriding error by the trial judge, his or her perceptions should be respected”.&nbsp; It is true that deficient reasons may cloak a palpable and overriding error, requiring appellate intervention.&nbsp; But the appellate court’s point of departure should be a deferential stance based on the propositions that the trial judge is in the best position to determine matters of fact and is presumed to know the basic law.</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>If the answers to these questions are affirmative, the reasons are not deficient, notwithstanding lack of detail and notwithstanding the fact that they are less than ideal.&nbsp; The trial judge should not be found to have erred in law for failing to describe every consideration leading to a finding of credibility, or to the conclusion of guilt or innocence.&nbsp; Nor should error of law be found because the trial judge has failed to reconcile every frailty in the evidence or allude to every relevant principle of law.&nbsp; Reasonable inferences need not be spelled out. For example if, in a case that turns on credibility, a trial judge explains that he or she has rejected the accused’s evidence, but fails to state that he or she has a reasonable doubt, this does not constitute an error of law; in such a case the conviction itself raises an inference that the accused’s evidence failed to raise a reasonable doubt. Finally, appellate courts must guard against simply sifting through the record and substituting their own analysis of the evidence for that of the trial judge because the reasons do not comply with their idea of ideal reasons.&nbsp; As was established in <i>Harper v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2, at p. 14, “[a]n appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor the right to reassess evidence at trial for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence. . . . Where the record, including the reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly the complete disregard of such evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to intercede.”</p>

Again he gave reasons, although less extensive than he had in the case of the complainant’s evidence.</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In summary, the reasons for judgment show that on most points, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant and rejected that of the accused.&nbsp; This said, there were aspects of the complainant’s evidence that he did not accept and aspects of the accused’s evidence that he accepted. In the end, the trial judge convicted the accused of three offences: (1) having intercourse with a minor; (2) indecent assault; and (3) having illicit intercourse with his stepdaughter.&nbsp; He acquitted the accused on the count of gross indecency.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>The Court of Appeal found the trial judge’s reasons to be deficient on the following grounds:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge did not clearly explain which of the offences were proved by which of the 11 incidents on which evidence had been led;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge failed to mention some of the accused’s evidence;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge failed to make general comments about the accused’s evidence;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge failed to reconcile his generally positive findings on the complainant’s evidence with the rejection of some of her evidence;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge failed to explain why he rejected the accused’s plausible denial of the charges.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>The trial judge’s failure to clearly explain which of the three offences were grounded by which of the incidents must be considered in the context of the record as a whole. The three offences of which the accused was convicted found support in the evidence as to a number of the incidents.&nbsp; This gives rise to a reasonable inference that the trial judge accepted some or all of this evidence and grounded the convictions on that evidence. While reasons drawing a precise link between each count on which the accused was found guilty and the particular evidence that the trial judge accepted in support of that count might have been desirable, this omission did not render the reasons deficient on this record, as discussed more fully below.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Nor did the trial judge’s failure to mention some of the accused’s evidence render the reasons for judgment deficient.&nbsp; The foregoing discussion of the law establishes that a trial judge is not obliged to discuss all of the evidence on any given point, provided the reasons show that he or she grappled with the substance of the live issues on the trial.&nbsp; It is clear from the reasons that the trial judge considered the accused’s evidence carefully, and indeed accepted it on some points.&nbsp; In these circumstances, failure to mention some aspects of his evidence does not constitute error.&nbsp; This also applies to the third objection, that the trial judge failed to make general comments about the accused’s evidence.&nbsp; As helpful as it might be in a given case, a trial judge is not required to summarize specific findings on credibility by issuing a general statement as to “overall” credibility.&nbsp; It is enough that the trial judge has demonstrated a recognition, where applicable, that the witness’s credibility was a live issue.</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>The trial judge’s alleged failure to reconcile his generally positive findings on the complainant’s evidence with the rejection of some of her evidence did not render the reasons deficient.&nbsp; As juries are routinely instructed, it is open to the trier of fact to accept some of the evidence of a witness, while rejecting other evidence of the same witness.&nbsp; The trial judge explained that the fact that many of the incidents testified to happened many years before and the fact that the complainant was a child at the time might well explain certain inconsistencies.&nbsp; In fact, he did explain why he rejected some of her evidence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Finally, the trial judge’s failure to explain why he rejected the accused’s plausible denial of the charges provides no ground for finding the reasons deficient.&nbsp; The trial judge’s reasons made it clear that in general, where the complainant’s evidence and the accused’s evidence conflicted, he accepted the evidence of the complainant.&nbsp; This explains why he rejected the accused’s denial.&nbsp; He gave reasons for accepting the complainant’s evidence, finding her generally truthful and “a very credible witness”, and concluding that her testimony on specific events was “not seriously challenged” (para. 68).&nbsp; It followed of necessity that he rejected the accused’s evidence where it conflicted with evidence of the complainant that he accepted.&nbsp; No further explanation for rejecting the accused’s evidence was required.&nbsp; In this context, the convictions themselves raise a reasonable inference that the accused’s denial of the charges failed to raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[67]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>It may have been desirable for the trial judge to explain certain matters more fully.&nbsp; In particular, it would have been preferable to relate the charges on which the accused was found guilty to the evidence of the specific incidents disclosed by the evidence.&nbsp; Given the trial judge’s mixed findings on credibility, the relationship between the 11 incidents to the convictions may not have been totally clear.&nbsp; However, on the law enunciated above, the question is whether the reasons, considered in the context of the record and the live issues at trial, failed to disclose a logical connection between the evidence and the verdict sufficient to permit meaningful appeal.&nbsp; The central issue at trial was credibility.&nbsp; It is clear that the trial judge accepted all or sufficient of the complainant’s ample evidence as to the incidents, and was not left with a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence or from the contradictory evidence of the accused.&nbsp; From this, he concluded that the accused’s guilt had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; When the record is considered as a whole, the basis for the verdict is evident.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Instead of looking for this basis, the Court of Appeal focussed on omitted details and proceeded from a sceptical perspective. Having concluded that the accused’s denial was plausible, it proceeded to examine the case from that perspective, asking whether the reasons disclosed that the trial judge had properly applied the reasonable doubt standard.&nbsp; In doing so, it fell into the trap identified in <i>Gagnon</i> of ignoring the trial judge’s unique position to see and hear witnesses, and instead substituted its own assessment of credibility for the trial judge’s view by impugning the reasons for judgment for not explaining why a reasonable doubt was not raised.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">III.&nbsp; <u>Conclusion</u></p>
