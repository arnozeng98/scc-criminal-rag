Consequently, the law must be construed, and interpretations that may minimize the alleged overbreadth must be explored.&nbsp; In light of Parliament‚Äôs purpose of criminalizing possession of material that poses a reasoned risk of harm to children, the word ‚Äúperson‚Äù in the definition of child pornography should be construed as including visual works of the imagination as well as depictions of actual people.&nbsp; The word ‚Äúperson‚Äù also includes the person possessing the expressive material.&nbsp; The term ‚Äúdepicted‚Äù refers to material that a reasonable observer would perceive as representing a person under the age of 18 years and engaged in explicit sexual activity.&nbsp; The expression ‚Äúexplicit sexual activity‚Äù refers to acts at the extreme end of the spectrum of sexual activity ‚Äì acts involving nudity or intimate sexual activity represented in a graphic and unambiguous fashion.&nbsp; Thus, representations of casual intimacy, such as depictions of kissing or hugging, are not covered by the offence.&nbsp; An objective approach must be applied to the terms ‚Äúdominant characteristic‚Äù and ‚Äúfor a sexual purpose‚Äù.&nbsp; The question is whether a reasonable viewer, looking at the depiction objectively and in context, would see its ‚Äúdominant characteristic‚Äù as the depiction of the child‚Äôs sexual organ or anal region in a manner that is reasonably perceived as intended to cause sexual stimulation to some viewers.&nbsp; Innocent photographs of a baby in the bath and other representations of non-sexual nudity are not covered by the offence.&nbsp; As for written material or visual representations that advocate or counsel sexual activity with a person under the age of 18 years that would be an offence under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, the requirement that the material ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù or ‚Äúcounsels‚Äù signifies that, when viewed objectively, the material must be seen as actively inducing or encouraging the described offences with children.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">In adopting s. 163.1(4), Parliament was pursuing the pressing and substantial objective of criminalizing the possession of child pornography that poses a reasoned risk of harm to children.&nbsp; The means chosen by Parliament are rationally connected to this objective.&nbsp; Parliament is not required to adduce scientific proof based on concrete evidence that the possession of child pornography causes harm to children.&nbsp; Rather, a reasoned apprehension of harm will suffice.&nbsp; Applying this test, the evidence establishes several connections between the possession of child pornography and harm to children: (1) child pornography promotes cognitive distortions; (2) it fuels fantasies that incite offenders to offend; (3) it is used for grooming and seducing victims; and (4) children are abused in the production of child pornography involving real children. Criminalizing possession may reduce the market for child pornography and the abuse of children it often involves.&nbsp; With respect to minimal impairment, when properly interpreted, the law catches much less material unrelated to harm to children than has been suggested.&nbsp; However, the law does capture the possession of two categories of material that one would not normally think of as ‚Äúchild pornography‚Äù and that raise little or no risk of harm to children: (1) written materials or visual representations created and held by the accused alone, exclusively for personal use; and (2) visual recordings created by or depicting the accused that do not depict unlawful sexual activity and are held by the accused exclusively for private use.&nbsp; The bulk of the material falling within these two classes engages important values underlying the s. 2(<i>b</i>) guarantee while posing no reasoned risk of harm to children.&nbsp; In its main impact, s. 163.1(4) is proportionate and constitutional.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the law‚Äôs application to materials in the two problematic classes, while peripheral to its objective, poses significant problems at the final stage of the proportionality analysis.&nbsp; In these applications the restriction imposed by s. 163.1(4) regulates expression where it borders on thought.&nbsp; The cost of prohibiting such materials to the right of free expression outweighs any tenuous benefit it might confer in preventing harm to children.&nbsp; To this extent, the law cannot be considered proportionate in its effects, and the infringement of s. 2(<i>b</i>) contemplated by the legislation is not demonstrably justifiable under s. 1.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Second, the prohibition of the possession of child pornography minimally impairs the right to free expression.&nbsp; Although s. 163.1(4) is directed only to the private possession of child pornography, children are particularly vulnerable in the private sphere, since a large portion of child pornography is produced privately and used privately by those who possess it.&nbsp; The harmful effect on the attitudes of those who possess child pornography similarly occurs in private.&nbsp; Consequently, prohibiting the simple possession of child pornography has an additional reductive effect on the harm it causes.&nbsp; The prohibition of the possession of child pornography also captures visual and written works of the imagination which do not involve the participation of any actual children or youth in their production; in enacting s. 163.1(4), Parliament sought to prevent not only the harm that flows from the use of children in pornography, but also the harm that flows from the very existence of images and words which degrade and dehumanize children and to send the message that children are not appropriate sexual partners.&nbsp; The focus of the inquiry must be on the harm of the message of the representations and not on their manner of creation, or on the intent or identity of their creator.&nbsp; Given the low value of the speech at issue in this case and the fact that it undermines the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights of children, Parliament was justified in concluding that visual works of the imagination would harm children.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The inclusion of written material in the offence of possession of child pornography does not amount to thought control.&nbsp; The legislation seeks to prohibit material that Parliament believed was harmful.&nbsp; The inclusion of written material which advocates and counsels the commission of offences against children is consistent with this aim, since, by its very nature, it is harmful, regardless of its authorship.&nbsp; Evidence suggests that the cognitive distortions of paedophiles are reinforced by such material and that written pornography fuels the sexual fantasies of paedophiles and could incite them to offend.&nbsp; Although the prohibition in s. 163.1(4) extends to teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 who keep pornographic videotapes or pictures of themselves, this effect of the provision is a reasonable limit on teenagers‚Äô freedom of expression.&nbsp; A review of adolescent child pornography cases reveals that there is a great risk that they will be exploited in its creation.&nbsp; Hence, while adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 may legally engage in sexual activity, Parliament had a strong basis for concluding that the age limit in the definition of child pornography should be set at 18.&nbsp; It is not necessary that the provision contain a defence to protect teenagers who are in possession of erotic videos or pictures of themselves.&nbsp; Such a defence would undermine Parliament‚Äôs objective of protecting all children, since some adolescents under the age of 18 groom other children into engaging in sexual conduct.&nbsp; There is also no guarantee, even when a teenager is in possession of a pornographic picture or videotape depicting himself or herself, that it was created in a consensual environment.&nbsp; The creation of permanent records of teenagers‚Äô sexual activities has consequences which children of that age may not have sufficient maturity to understand.&nbsp; The Court should defer to Parliament‚Äôs decision to restrict teenagers‚Äô freedom in this area.&nbsp; The provision does not amount to a total ban on the possession of child pornography.&nbsp; The provision reflects an attempt by Parliament to weigh the competing rights and values at stake and achieve a proper balance.&nbsp; The definitional limits act as safeguards to ensure that only material that is antithetical to Parliament‚Äôs objectives in proscribing child pornography will be targeted, and the legislation incorporates defences of artistic merit, educational, scientific or medical purpose, and a defence of the public good.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Third, when the effects of the provision are examined in their overall context, the benefits of the legislation far outweigh any deleterious effects on the right to freedom of expression and the interests of privacy.&nbsp; Section 163.1(4) helps to prevent the harm to children which results from the production of child pornography; deters the use of child pornography in the grooming of children; curbs the collection of child pornography by paedophiles; and helps to ensure that an effective law enforcement scheme can be implemented.&nbsp; In sum, the legislation benefits society as a whole as it sends a clear message that deters the development of antisocial attitudes.&nbsp; The law does not trench significantly on speech possessing social value since there is a very tenuous connection between the possession of child pornography and the right to free expression.&nbsp; At most, the law has a detrimental cost to those who find base fulfilment in the possession of child pornography.&nbsp; The privacy of those who possess child pornography is protected by the right against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The law intrudes into the private sphere because doing so is necessary to achieve its salutary objectives.&nbsp; The privacy interest restricted by the law is closely related to the specific harmful effects of child pornography.&nbsp; Moreover, the provision‚Äôs beneficial effects in protecting the privacy interests of children are proportional to the detrimental effects on the privacy of those who possess child pornography.</p>

Butler</i>,<i> </i>[1992] 1 S.C.R. 452, did not require conclusive proof that obscene materials cause harm, Shaw J. apparently required such proof and found little scientific evidence linking the possession of child pornography to these risks.&nbsp; As a result, he considered the salutary effects of the law to be limited.&nbsp; As for the law‚Äôs deleterious effects, he found that ‚Äúthe invasion of freedom of expression and personal privacy is profound‚Äù (para. 49) and held that they were ‚Äúnot outweighed by the limited beneficial effects of the prohibition‚Äù (para. 50).&nbsp; Shaw J. concluded that the law was inconsistent with the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and could not be justified under s. 1, rendering it invalid under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec52subsec1" target="_blank">s. 52(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1982<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Such protection‚Äù, the Court continued, ‚Äúis . . . ‚Äòfundamental‚Äô because in a free, pluralistic and democratic society we prize a diversity of ideas and opinions for their inherent value both to the community and to the individual‚Äù.&nbsp; As stated by Cardozo J. in <i>Palko v.

C√¥t√©, <i>The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</i> (3rd ed. 2000)). However, E. A. Driedger in <i>Construction of Statutes</i> (2nd ed. 1983) best captures the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p. 87, Driedger states: ‚ÄúToday there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.‚Äù&nbsp; Recent cases which have cited the above passage with approval include: <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; <i>R. v. Hydro‚ÄëQu√©bec</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 213, at para. 144; <i>Royal Bank of Canada v.

Canada</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 10.&nbsp; Supplementing this approach is the presumption that Parliament intended to enact legislation in conformity with the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>: see Sullivan, <i>Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 322-27.&nbsp; If a legislative provision can be read both in a way that is constitutional and in a way that is not, the former reading should be adopted: see<i> Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson</i>,<i> </i>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1078; <i>R. v. Swain</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, at p. 1010; <i>R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, at p. 660; <i>R. v.

XVI, June 3, 1993, at p. 20328.&nbsp; However, Parliament did not cast its net over all material that might conceivably pose any risk to children or produce any negative attitudinal changes.&nbsp; Mindful of the importance of freedom of expression in our society and the dangers of vague, overbroad legislation in the criminal sphere, Parliament set its targets principally on clear forms of ‚Äúchild pornography‚Äù: depictions of explicit sex with children, depictions of sexual organs and anal areas of children and material advocating sexual crimes with children.&nbsp; Through qualifications and defences Parliament indicated that it did not seek to catch all material that might harm children, but only material that poses a reasoned risk of harm to children and, even then, only where the countervailing right of free expression or the public good does not outweigh that risk of harm.&nbsp; With this aim in mind, I turn to s. 163.1.</p>

The mere description of the criminal act is not caught.&nbsp; Rather, the prohibition is against material that, viewed objectively, sends the message that sex with children can and should be pursued.&nbsp;</p>

While Nabokov‚Äôs <i>Lolita</i>,<i> </i>Boccaccio‚Äôs <i>Decameron</i>, and Plato‚Äôs <i>Symposium</i> portray or discuss sexual activities with children, on an objective view they cannot be said to advocate or counsel such conduct in the sense of actively inducing or encouraging&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Nor would the section catch political advocacy for lowering the age of consent because such advocacy would not promote the commission of an offence but the amendment of the law.&nbsp; Likewise, an anthropological work discussing the sexual practices of adolescents in other cultures and describing such adolescents as well-adjusted and healthy would not be caught because it would be merely descriptive as opposed to advocating or counselling illegal acts.&nbsp; I note that in any event these examples would likely fall within the artistic merit, medical, educational, scientific, or public good defences, discussed below.</p>

It seems clear the defence must be established objectively, since Parliament cannot have intended a bare assertion of artistic merit to provide a defence.&nbsp; This leaves two possibilities. First, ‚Äúartistic merit‚Äù may refer to the quality of the work in the opinion of objective observers.&nbsp; It is not uncommon in everyday discourse to say of a work of art that, although it is genuinely art, it possesses little or no ‚Äúartistic merit‚Äù.&nbsp; If ‚Äúartistic merit‚Äù is used in this sense, then the task of the court would be to determine how good the work of art was.&nbsp; Art students learning their craft, inept artists and artists breaking conventions to establish new idioms might well find their work classified as lacking ‚Äúartistic merit‚Äù and hence lose the benefit of the defence. On the assumption that this was the meaning of ‚Äúartistic merit‚Äù, it was argued that the defence is too limited and arbitrary to protect artistic expression adequately.</p>

The subjective intention of the creator will be relevant, although it is unlikely to be conclusive.&nbsp; The form and content of the work may provide evidence as to whether it is art.&nbsp; Its connections with artistic conventions, traditions or styles may also be a factor.&nbsp; The opinion of experts on the subject may be helpful. Other factors, like the mode of production, display and distribution, may shed light on whether the depiction or writing possesses artistic value.&nbsp; It may be, as the case law develops, that the factors to be considered will be refined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Langer</i> (1995), 123 D.L.R. (4th) 289 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), McCombs J. interpreted s. 163.1(6) as importing a requirement that material, to have artistic merit, must comport with community standards in the sense of not posing a risk of harm to children.&nbsp; I am not persuaded that we should read a community standards qualification into the defence.&nbsp; To do so would involve reading in a qualification that Parliament has not stated.&nbsp; Further, reading in the qualification of conformity with community standards would run counter to the logic of the defence, namely that artistic merit outweighs any harm that might result from the sexual representations of children in the work.&nbsp; Most material caught by the definition of child pornography could pose a potential risk of harm to children.&nbsp; To restrict the artistic merit defence to material posing no risk of harm to children would defeat the purpose of the defence.&nbsp; Parliament clearly intended that some pornographic and possibly harmful works would escape prosecution on the basis of this defence; otherwise there is no need for it.</p>

The wording of the section suggests that it functions in the same manner as other defences such as self defence, provocation or necessity.&nbsp; The accused raises the defence by pointing to facts capable of supporting it (generally something more than a bare assertion that the creator subjectively intended to create art), at which point the Crown must disprove the defence beyond a reasonable doubt: see <i>Langer</i>,<i> supra. </i></p>

Private journals, diaries, writings, drawings and other works of the imagination, created by oneself exclusively for oneself, may all trigger the s. 163.1(4) offence.&nbsp; The law, in its prohibition on the possession of such materials, reaches into a realm of exceedingly private expression, where s. 2(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>values may be particularly implicated and state intervention may be markedly more intrusive. Further, the risk of harm arising from the private creation and possession of such materials, while not eliminated altogether, is low.&nbsp;</p>

Absent evidence as to whether the benefit from sublimation equals the harm of incitement or otherwise, this conclusion seems tenuous.&nbsp; More fundamentally, the trial judge proceeded on the basis that scientific proof was required.&nbsp; The lack of unanimity in scientific opinion is not fatal.&nbsp; Complex human behaviour may not lend itself to precise scientific demonstration, and the courts cannot hold Parliament to a higher standard of proof than the subject matter admits of.&nbsp; Some studies suggest that child pornography, like other forms of pornography, will fuel fantasies and may incite offences in the case of certain individuals.&nbsp; This reasoned apprehension of harm demonstrates a rational connection between the law and the reduction of harm to children through child pornography.</p>

Martineau</i>, [1990] 2&nbsp;S.C.R. 633.&nbsp;&nbsp; If other laws already achieve the goals, new laws limiting constitutional rights are unjustifiable.&nbsp; However, an effective measure should not be discounted simply because Parliament already has other measures in place.&nbsp; It may provide additional protection or reinforce existing protections.&nbsp; Parliament may combat an evil by enacting a number of different and complementary measures directed to different aspects of the targeted problem:&nbsp; see, e.g., <i>R. v. Whyte</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3.&nbsp; Here the evidence amply establishes that criminalizing the possession of child pornography not only provides additional protection against child exploitation -- exploitation associated with the production of child pornography for the market generated by possession and the availability of material for arousal, attitudinal change and grooming -- but also reinforces the laws criminalizing the production and distribution of child pornography.</p>

Many of the other hypothetical examples relied on in the courts below as suggesting overbreadth either disappear entirely on a proper construction of the statutory definition of child pornography, or are narrowed to the extent that material is caught only where it is related to harm to children.&nbsp; If these were the only grounds for concern arising from s. 163.1(4), I would have little difficulty concluding the provision is carefully tailored to its objective.&nbsp; It should also be remembered that to effect a conviction under s. 163.1(4), as under any other criminal provision, the Crown must establish that the accused possessed the requisite <i>mens rea</i>; this requirement, too, limits the reach of the statute.&nbsp;</p>

Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1120, 2000 SCC 69, that it may be difficult to make the case of obscenity against written texts, materials that advocate or counsel sexual offences with children may qualify.&nbsp; The Crown has also met the burden of showing that the law will benefit society by reducing the possibility of cognitive distortions, the use of pornography in grooming victims, and the abuse of children in the manufacture and continuing existence of this material.&nbsp; Explicit sexual photographs of children, videotapes of pre-pubescent children, and written works advocating sexual offences with children ‚Äì all these and more pose a reasoned risk of harm to children.&nbsp; Thus we may conclude that in its main impact, s. 163.1(4) is proportionate and constitutional.</p>

The applications of the law that pose constitutional problems are exactly those whose relation to the objective of the legislation is most remote.&nbsp; Carving out those applications by incorporating the proposed exception will not undermine the force of the law; rather, it will preserve the force of the statute while also recognizing the purposes of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The defects of the section are not so great that their exclusion amounts to impermissible redrafting, as was the case in <i>Osborne v.

Heywood</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761.&nbsp; The new exceptions resemble those that Parliament has already created and are consistent with its overall approach of catching mainstream child pornography reasonably linked to harm while excluding peripheral material that engages free speech values.&nbsp; Moreover, since the problematic applications lie on the periphery of the material targeted by Parliament, carving them out will not create an exception-riddled provision bearing little resemblance to the provision envisioned by Parliament.&nbsp; This suggests that excluding the offending applications of the law will not subvert Parliament‚Äôs object. On the other hand, striking down the statute altogether would assuredly undermine Parliament‚Äôs object, making it impossible to combat the lawfully targeted harms until it can pass new legislation.</p>

Res. 1386 (XIV) (1959), in its preamble, states that the child ‚Äúneeds special safeguards and care‚Äù.&nbsp; In 1992, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted the <i>Programme of Action for the Prevention of the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography</i>, 55th Mtg., 1992/74.&nbsp; Additional instruments such as the <i>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</i>, 993 U.N.T.S. 3, art. 10(3), and the <i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</i>, 999 U.N.T.S. 171, art. 24, also emphasize the protection of children.&nbsp; The recent <i>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography</i>, A/RES/54/263 (2000), which prohibits, <i>inter alia</i>, child pornography, has already been signed by 69 states; see <span class="Hypertext">&lt;http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/treaty18_asp.htm&gt;</span> (accessed January 23, 2001).</p>
