(dissenting):&nbsp; The search of the accused’s residence was not carried out in a reasonable manner.&nbsp; The police had no reason to believe that a “dynamic” entry was necessary to protect the safety of the officers.&nbsp; Neither the accused nor any other occupant of the house had a history of violence or a criminal record, there was no suspicion that the accused was a member of any gang, and the police had no reason to believe that there were firearms or any other weapons on the premises.&nbsp; The violent nature of the intervention caused extensive damage to the house, leaving it in a shambles.&nbsp; In the absence of exigent circumstances or other particularized grounds, the police were obliged by law to make reasonable inquiries, before conducting that search, to ascertain the nature of the premises they intended to enter, the identities and background of its occupants, and the real risk, in executing the warrant, of resistance by force.&nbsp; In this case, the police made no attempt to obtain any information regarding the accused’s home or its occupants.&nbsp; Nor did the Crown provide any evidence or any reasonable explanation for the failure of the police to make the requisite inquiry.&nbsp; While the police had reasonable grounds to believe that N and T were gang‑affiliated drug traffickers, the record indicates that they had no reasonable belief that either N or T would be at the accused’s residence at the time of the search.&nbsp; T had never been seen to enter that residence and N was already in police custody.&nbsp; Finally, there was no possible link between the evidence gathered by police and the violent method of entry into the accused’s home.&nbsp; The risk analysis, which was designed to identify potential risks for execution of the search warrants and to inform the tactical team about the investigation and its targets, did not mention the accused or any other occupant of the residence, and was never shown to the tactical team.&nbsp; The unannounced and violent entry appears to have been driven more by general practice than by information regarding the accused’s home and its occupants.</span></p>

The police had well-grounded concerns that the use of less intrusive methods would pose safety risks to the officers and occupants of the house and risk the destruction of evidence.&nbsp; The suggestions that the police had no basis for their concerns about the risk of violence or destruction of evidence are, with respect, contrary to the findings of the trial judge and to the evidence in the record.&nbsp; Both the police and the reviewing judge are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the established facts.&nbsp; Only a failure to do so could lead one to the conclusion that there was no basis for reasonable concern about the risk of violence and the destruction of evidence in this case. Even the appellant conceded in the Court of Appeal that the destruction of evidence was a realistic concern. Similarly, the suggestion that, before the search,&nbsp; the police could easily have discovered (by unspecified means) what they learned during it, is contrary to an express finding of fact by the trial judge.&nbsp; Finally, the suggestion that the decision to make an unannounced&nbsp; hard entry into the Cornell residence was simply a rote application of a general police practice is not supported by the evidence. There is no evidence of such a practice let alone of its application here.</p>

It is also important to remember that the decisions made by the police as to how to conduct the entry to the residence must be assessed in light of the information reasonably available to them at the time the decision was made. There is no question here that, had police known what they would in fact encounter in the residence, the approach would have been different.&nbsp; However, as the trial judge wisely observed, “the [appellant] cannot attack the police decision on the basis of circumstances that were not reasonably known to the police”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 16.</p>

The police nonetheless were entitled to draw reasonable inferences about the risks the search of the Cornell residence posed to them and in relation to the destruction of evidence from the activities and people involved. As I shall outline in a moment, the police had good reasons to believe based, among other things, on their surveillance of the premises, that the Cornell residence, which the appellant had given as his address,&nbsp; was being used in a drug dealing enterprise carried on by members of a violent criminal gang. They also had good reason to believe that the appellant himself was associated with at least one of these gang members who, through&nbsp; police surveillance of the Cornell residence, appeared to be welcome there. Attempts to consider the appellant in isolation from these facts are, in my respectful view, highly artificial.</p>

As one of the investigators said in his evidence at trial:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">. . . it was a real concern for police officers having to attend any residence that may be frequented by persons from these groups, in that they could pose a real threat to the police. We would not want them to react to our presence, take hostages, to fight the police to try to gain their escape, to try to fend off the police while the evidence was destroyed.&nbsp; So it became a very, very real security risk for the police officers that would be attending these residences.&nbsp; [A.R., vol.

Entry involved battering the front door and entering the house while yelling “Police, search warrant”. The only person in the house at the time was the appellant’s brother, who was 29 years old and mentally challenged. He was taken down and handcuffed with his hands behind his back. His emotional distress became quickly apparent and the officer dealing with him removed the handcuffs, took off his balaclava, called the accompanying paramedic to assist and facilitated a call by the man to his mother Lorraine. According to the evidence, from the time of entry to the time that this individual was out of the handcuffs and seated on a couch being comforted by one of the officers was about four minutes: C.A., at para. 40, <i>per</i> Slatter J.A.&nbsp; As noted by Slatter J.A. in the Court of Appeal, there was some damage to the premises during the entry, but Ms. Cornell testified that she was able to repair it with material she had around the house without incurring any expense: C.A., at para. 31.</p>

DeWolfe</i>,&nbsp; 2007 NSCA 79, 256 N.S.R. (2d) 221, at para. 46.&nbsp; Whether there existed reasonable grounds for concern about safety or destruction of evidence must not be viewed “through the ‘lens of hindsight’”:<i> Crampton v.

These additional facts strengthen the grounds to believe that cocaine would be in the residence (and therefore liable to be easily destroyed) and that a violent reaction to entry might be encountered.</p>

Lau</i>, 2003 BCCA 337, 175 C.C.C. (3d) 273, and <i>R. v. Schedel</i>,<i> </i>2003 BCCA 364, 175 C.C.C. (3d) 193, are of no assistance to the appellant.&nbsp; In neither case was there any mention of the police wearing balaclavas. Both cases concerned police reliance on a blanket policy (one that did not involve balaclavas), of which there was evidence in those cases, always to use a hard entry for the search of suspected marijuana grow operations even in the complete absence of evidence of risk of violence or destruction of evidence.&nbsp; There is no such “blanket policy” in evidence here and the record shows that there were ample grounds for the police to be concerned about violence and destruction of evidence in this case.</p>

The police did not just show up at a previously uninvestigated residence and barge in.&nbsp; The Cornell residence had been under police surveillance on three occasions before the day of entry for nearly 10 hours.&nbsp; On the day of entry, the house was under constant police surveillance from the morning until entry was made shortly before 6:00 in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the police conducted approximately two full working days of surveillance on this residence before going in.&nbsp; At the time of applying for the warrant, the police had consulted various sources, including:&nbsp; the Police Information Management System; a City of Calgary computer system that contains records with respect to the City of Calgary waterworks customers including the address to which service is supplied and the name of the subscriber; the City of Calgary’s online database which&nbsp; provides ownership data for addresses in the city; and subscriber information for Telus Mobility. These sources indicated that the property was owned by Phuong Kim Thi Le, occupied by Lorraine Cornell, that Jason Cornell had given the address of the Cornell residence as his address and that Jason Cornell was the subscriber for a cellular telephone found in a car driven by Nguyen the previous September.</p>

His conclusion that&nbsp; a “sense of proportionality” would have led police to conclude that there was little risk of the destruction of evidence is similarly not supported (para. 103).&nbsp; In my view, O’Brien&nbsp; J.A.’s reasoning is based on an erroneous, artificial approach of isolating the appellant from what the police reasonably believed was going on in his house.&nbsp; The police reasonably believed that the appellant’s residence was being used in a criminal drug dealing enterprise carried on by members of a violent criminal gang and that the appellant had some association with at least one gang member.&nbsp; The police were entitled to draw reasonable inferences from these facts.&nbsp; Justice O’Brien’s conclusions also in my respectful view represent undue appellate intrusion into the findings of fact by the trial judge, findings which, as I have mentioned, do not disclose any clear or determinative error.</p>

The appellant asserts that, for officer safety, the police would have been entitled to detain these women, incommunicado, so that they would not alert other persons to the police presence and further, that interrogation of the women would have led them to believe that&nbsp; the use of a forced entry was not appropriate.&nbsp; In my view, this line of reasoning is speculative and makes unreasonable demands on the police.&nbsp; As Slatter J.A. correctly points out, at para. 14 of his reasons, the appellant’s argument assumes that an investigative detention of these women and that preventing them from any contact would have been lawful in the circumstances. It also assumes that they would have been cooperative, that they would have been truthful and that the police would have decided to take what they said at face value.&nbsp; Even putting aside all of this speculation, the appellant’s suggestion, if accepted, would impose on the police the obligation to completely change their plans, at the last minute, while engaged in a closely coordinated execution of three different search warrants in very close order. In my respectful view, the appellant’s suggestion has no basis in the evidence and makes unreasonable demands on the police in the circumstances of this case.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="Section56">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.55pt">Except in exigent circumstances, police officers must make an announcement before forcing entry into a dwelling house.&nbsp; In the ordinary case, they should give: “(i) notice of presence by knocking or ringing the door bell, (ii) notice of authority, by identifying themselves as law enforcement officers and (iii) notice of purpose, by stating a lawful reason for entry”: <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, at p. 747.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.55pt">Neither the wisdom nor the vitality of the knock and announce principle is in issue on this appeal. Experience has shown that it not only protects the dignity and privacy interests of the occupants of dwellings, but it may also enhance the safety of the police and the public: Commission of Inquiry into Policing in British Columbia, <i>Closing The Gap:</i> <i>Policing and the Community — The Report</i> (1994), vol. 2, at pp. H-50 to H-53.&nbsp; However, the principle, while salutary and well established, is not absolute: <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, at pp. 743-47.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.55pt;line-height:200%">Where the police depart from this approach, there is an onus on them to explain why they thought it necessary to do so.&nbsp; If challenged, the Crown must lay an evidentiary framework to support the conclusion that the police had reasonable grounds to be concerned about the possibility of harm to themselves or occupants, or about the destruction of evidence.&nbsp; The greater the departure from the principles of announced entry, the heavier the onus on the police to justify their approach.&nbsp; The evidence to justify such behaviour must be apparent in the record and available to the police at the time they acted. The Crown cannot rely on <i>ex post facto </i>justifications: see&nbsp; <i>R. v. Genest</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 59, at pp. 89-91; <i>R. v. Gimson</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R.&nbsp; 692, at p. 693.&nbsp; I would underline the words Chief Justice Dickson used in <i>Genest</i>: what must be present is evidence to support the conclusion that “there were grounds to be concerned about the possibility of violence”: p. 90. I respectfully agree with Slatter J.A. when he said in the present case that “[s]ection 8 of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> does not require the police to put their lives or safety on the line if there is even a low risk of weapons being present”: para. 24.</p>

In <i>Genest</i> at p. 89 the Court spoke of a “real threat” of violent behaviour, and “grounds to be concerned about the possibility of violence”, with the proviso that a threat of violence does not “amount to a <i>carte blanche</i> for the police to ignore completely all restrictions on police behaviour”.
