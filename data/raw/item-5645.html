   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">In June 1976, an information was laid by the R.C.M.P. in Newfoundland against the appellant <i>viz. </i>that he had on April 22, 1976, at St.&nbsp;John’s District, Newfoundland, care or control of a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol level in excess of 80 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood contrary to s.&nbsp;236 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>Following a trial on August 3, 1976 and on </span><span lang="EN-CA">May 5, 1977</span><span lang="EN-CA">, the appellant was convicted on the latter date. The magistrate had received in evidence a certificate under s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) of the <i>Code </i>in force on April 22, 1976, stating that on the date in question <i>a sample </i>of appellant’s breath had been received into a Borkenstein Breathalyzer and indicated a blood alcohol level in excess of the prescribed limit. The question of law stated was whether the magistrate erred in law in ruling that the amendments to the <i>Code </i>enacted by the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, </i>1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, proclaimed May 7, 1976, requiring that more than one breath sample be received into the breathalyzer and analyzed did not apply retrospectively to proof of a charge arising on April 22, 1976. While Noel J. answered the question in the negative and dismissed the appeal, the Appeal Division reversed and quashed the conviction.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 222]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held: </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">The appeal should be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Pratte and Mclntyre JJ.: The amendments in question were primarily designed to give police officers the right to require more than one sample of breath from a person suspected of a breach of ss. 234 or 236. A comparison of s.&nbsp;235 as it was before and after amendment indicates that the amendment related to substantive law. Taking the amendment to s.&nbsp;235 together with the other amendments it is clear that the prospective character of s.&nbsp;235 is determinative of the construction to be placed on the new s.&nbsp;237 which cannot be taken to refer to samples that could not have been legally demanded at the time and that the new s.&nbsp;237 was intended to apply only when at least two samples of breath have been legally demanded and obtained. Further it is apparent that the new s.&nbsp;237 could not in fact operate retrospectively. There was no reason to believe that Parliament intended, when passing the amendments, to allow for an interval during which the prosecution of offences already committed would be frustrated because the rules in ss. 235 and 237 would not be available for the enforcement of s.&nbsp;236. Also the statutory rule in s.&nbsp;36(<i>d</i>) of the <i>Interpretation Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, modified the common law by prescribing that the retroactive operation of procedural enactments shall not be absolute but will take place only to the extent that the new rules of procedure may be adapted to the proceedings taken in respect of a matter that has occurred before the new rules came into effect. Thus the new procedure will not apply retrospectively if or to the extent that it cannot be adapted. Here the new procedure could not be adapted and could not apply to a sample taken under the old s.&nbsp;235. Both s.&nbsp;36 and the common law therefore constitute insurmountable obstacles to the conclusion reached by the Appeal Division.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Ritchie and Estey JJ., <i>dissenting: </i>The circumstances in this appeal were that the appellant was apprehended on April 22, 1976, and required to furnish a sample of his breath under s.&nbsp;235 of the <i>Code </i>as it then provided. The sample indicated a blood alcohol content in excess of the prescribed limit and had the appellant been charged and tried on the day following his apprehension, the sample so procured would have constituted <i>prima facie </i>evidence of his blood content at the time of his apprehension. No information, however, was laid until June 1, by which time the amendments to the <i>Code </i>had been proclaimed as law. Not only was the laying of the information delayed but the trial did not</span></p>

   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">commence until August 3, 1976 whereupon it was adjourned and not concluded until </span><span lang="EN-CA">May 5, 1977</span><span lang="EN-CA">. The rules of evidence as to the effect of such a certificate had been amended three months before the trial commenced and a year before it concluded. The issue turned on whether the amendment was to be regarded as penal or merely a change in the method of proof. Morgan J.A. in the Appeal Division rightly concluded that <i>Howard Smith Paper Mills v. The Queen, </i>[1957] S.C.R. 403 applied. Here as in that case the amendment neither created an offence nor took away a defence. The only change was in the mode of proof requiring that before the rebuttable presumption could arise more than one sample was required. It was Parliament’s view that a double sampling was necessary to convict and this intention of Parliament was known in the form of an effective law prior to the laying of the charge. Different considerations might well have applied had the charge been laid prior to the date of the amendment.</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the combined effect of ss. 235 and 237 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>as amended by the <i>Criminal Code Amendment Act 1975, </i>1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, is that the certificate of a qualified technician based on the analysis of only one sample of breath, constitutes <i>of itself </i>evidence of the blood alcohol content of a person charged under s.&nbsp;236 at the time of the alleged offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I have no doubt that, before the amendment above referred to, such a certificate was sufficient to create a rebuttable presumption as to the blood alcohol content of the blood of such a person but the question here at issue is whether the amendment has had the effect of requiring the certificate to be based on the analysis of two or more such samples before it can be acceptable as evidence of its contents without further proof.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">And in concluding the Court said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">…what is at issue here is whether or not a technician’s certificate based on the analysis of only one sample is, of itself, without further proof, <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the statements contained in it and this must depend on whether the rebuttable presumption accorded to such a certificate by s.&nbsp;237, before the amendment, subsists under the section&nbsp;as amended or whether the new wording requires that the certificate be based upon two or more analyses before it can be accepted without further proof of its contents.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The effect of s.&nbsp;237 both before and after the amendment is to establish the conditions under which the certificate of a qualified technician is admissible, without further evidence, as proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused. These provisions are obviously designed to assist the Crown in proving its case, and as they serve to restrict the normal rights of the accused to cross-examination and saddle him with the burden of proving that the certificate does not accurately reflect his blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offence, they are to be strictly construed and, where ambiguous, interpreted in favour of the accused.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the present case, not only was the laying of the information against the respondent delayed for the period which I have mentioned, but the trial did not commence until August 3, 1976, where-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 227]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">upon it appears to have then adjourned and was not concluded until May 5, 1977. The rules of evidence respecting the effect to be given to such a certificate as constituting <i>prima facie </i>proof of its contents had, however, been amended three months before the trial commenced and a year before it was concluded.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Unlike the case of <i>Noble, </i>the offence in the present case was allegedly committed before the amendment to s.&nbsp;237 had been enacted, but the information was laid and the trial held subsequent thereto, and the question to be determined is whether a trial held after the amendment was proclaimed was to be governed by the statutory rules as to proof which were then in force or whether effect was to be given to the provisions of a statute which had long since been repealed. It is important to keep in mind the fact that the amendment in question in no way made any material alteration in the offence created by s.&nbsp;236 with which the accused is charged. The amendment was concerned exclusively with the method of proof and the nature of the presumption created by the production of the technician’s certificate, although the penalty was increased.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The proposed amendment had received Royal Assent on </span><span lang="EN-CA">March 30, 1976</span><span lang="EN-CA">, but it was not proclaimed until May 7, 1976, and it is therefore apparent that the Crown was alerted to the nature of the impending amendment at the time when the offence was allegedly committed in April. As I have pointed out, no information was laid until </span><span lang="EN-CA">June 1, 1976</span><span lang="EN-CA">, and no trial commenced until the 3rd of August of the same year. There is nothing in the stated case to indicate the date at which the technician’s certificate was tendered in evidence and as far as the record is concerned it may have been at any time up to May 1977; but in any event, it was tendered in the course of a trial which was governed by the rules of evidence created and established by the amendment to s.&nbsp;237.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The issue raised by this appeal turns upon whether the amendment in question can be considered as penal in nature or whether its only effect is to change the method of proof. In this regard I agree with the passage from the reasons for judgment of Mr.&nbsp;Justice Morgan in which he</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 228]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">concludes that the present circumstances are governed by the judgment of this Court in <i>Howard Smith Paper Mills v. The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[4]</span></span></span></a>.<i> </i>Mr.&nbsp;Justice Morgan put the matter thus:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">An example of a procedural alteration that was construed as retrospective may be found in <i>Howard Smith Paper Mills v. The Queen </i>(1957) 118 C.C.C 321. In that case one of the questions the Supreme Court of Canada was asked to consider was whether Sec. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act R.S.C. 1952 Ch.&nbsp;314 as enacted by 1949 (Second Session) Ch.&nbsp;12 section&nbsp;3 and as amended by 1952 (Can.) c. 39, S8 was applicable in a prosecution for breaches of that Act which occurred before the repeal of that section&nbsp;and its reenactment in a slightly different form. In his reasons for judgment Cartwright J. at p.&nbsp;337 held that Sec. 41 was retrospective for the following reasons:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">While s.&nbsp;41 makes a revolutionary change in the law of evidence, it creates no offence, it takes away no defence, it does not render criminal any course of conduct which was not already so declared before its enactment, it does not alter the character or legal effect of any transaction already entered into; it deals with a matter of evidence only and, in my opinion, the learned trial Judge was right in holding that it applied to the trial of the charge before him. (See 1957 S.C.R. 403 at 420.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">These reasons are equally applicable in the construction of the section&nbsp;with which we are here concerned.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the present case the appellant contended that by giving effect to the provisions of the amended section&nbsp;as controlling a trial which took place after the amendment in relation to an offence alleged to have been committed prior to its enactment, the Court of Appeal was according retrospective effect to a penal statute and in this regard reliance was placed on the reasons for judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. LeSarge</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[5]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>in which case the Court was considering the effect of amendments to the <i>Protection of Privacy Act, </i>1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, and finding them to be penal in character, ruled against any retrospective effect being given to them. In the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court in that case, Mr.&nbsp;Justice Houlden observed at p.&nbsp;395:</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 229]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">There is a well-established principle of statutory interpretation that penal legislation is ordinarily not to be given a retrospective effect: 36 Hals., 3rd ed., p.&nbsp;425, para.&nbsp;645. On the other hand, there is an equally well-established principle of statutory interpretation that a statute which deals with matters of procedure <i>only </i>is ordinarily to be given a retrospective application: Maxwell, <i>Interpretation of Statutes, </i>12th ed. (1969), p.&nbsp;222. In the present case, the <i>Protection of Privacy Act </i>does not deal with procedural matters <i>only. </i>Rather, it creates three new substantive offences, namely: wilful interception of a private conversation (s. 178.11(1)); possessing, selling or purchasing a device for surreptitious interception of a private communication (s. 178.18(1)); and wilful disclosure of information obtained by interception of a private communication (s. 178.2(1)). Section 178.16 is so inextricably bound up with the substantive provisions of the <i>Protection of Privacy Act </i>that, in my opinion, it cannot be given a retrospective operation.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the present case, as in the case of <i>Howard Smith </i>the amendment has created “no offence, it takes away no defence, it does not render criminal any course of conduct which was not already so declared before its enactment” and I am satisfied that the only change effected by the amendment was a change in the mode of proof so that the rebuttable presumption created by the production of a technician’s certificate did not arise unless more than one sample had been analysed, whereas before the amendment a technician’s certificate based on only one sample was sufficient to raise a presumption as to proof of its contents.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The case of <i>R. v. MacGregor</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[6]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>was cited on behalf of the Crown as authority for the contention that the amendment to s.&nbsp;237 was prospective and in this regard Mr.&nbsp;Justice Clement, speaking for the majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta observed:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Thus, the three sections&nbsp;operate together. Section 236 has not been altered in any aspect relevant here, and the certificate was effective proof, <i>at the time the charge was laid, </i>of the commission of the offence. Sections 235 and 237 have been altered only to require more than one sample to be given and dealt with. I cannot discern in the amendments any intention of Parliament to obliterate the statutory evidence proving commission of the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 230]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">offence, which was effective <i>for the purpose at the time. </i>In my opinion, the amendments are prospective in operation, not intended to frustrate the prosecution of offences already committed. In this I find support in <i>R. v. LeSarge </i>(1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 388. I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">[The italics are my own]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Apart altogether from the complicated considerations of the correct categorization of this statute as being either procedural or substantive, there is a much more direct approach to the issue raised here. Parliament has evidently amended s.&nbsp;237 by replacing the right to prove certain matters by one breath sample analysis with an obligation on the enforcement authorities to make two breath sample analyses as the basis of proof. It is obvious that in the view of Parliament, the exposure of the citizen to conviction of a serious criminal offence should not be based on the risks of error flowing from a single test. Rather it was Parliament’s view that a double sampling was necessary to complete the process of conviction. This Parliament had announced in the form of an effective law prior to the laying of the charge against the respondent. Thus the prosecution, in proving the charge, must conform to the statute as it existed at the time the charge was laid. Otherwise the accused is not, in the view of Parliament, to be found guilty of the offence as charged. Against this clear result brought about by the action of Parliament prior to the laying of the charge against the appellant, the subtleties of the <i>Interpretation Act </i>provisions relating to repealed and amended statutes are of no avail. The guilt or innocence of the accused under these circumstances must flow directly from the plain meaning of the <i>Code </i>provision as it existed when the prosecution laid the charge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Different considerations might well apply if the charge in the present case had been laid before the date of the amendment, but as I have pointed out, the information was in fact not laid until three</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 231]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">weeks after the amendment had been proclaimed and this circumstance, in my view, serves to distinguish the present case from that of <i>R. v. MacGregor </i>which in turn was based on the case of <i>R. v. Bourassa</i><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[7]</span></span></span></a>.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the amendment here in question was procedural and evidentiary and carried no penal consequences such as those referred to in the case of <i>R. v. LeSarge.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In view of all the above, I would dismiss this appeal.</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. Did I err in law in ruling that the amendments to Section 237 of the Criminal Code of Canada, enacted by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, Statutes of Canada 1974‑75-76, Chapter 93, proclaimed in force the 7th day of May, A.D. 1976 requiring that more than one sample of the breath of a person suspected of a breach of Section 236 of the Criminal Code of Canada be received into a Borkenstein Breathalyzer and analyzed by a qualified technician within the meaning of the Criminal Code, do not apply retrospectively to proof of a charge contrary to Section 236 of the Criminal Code of Canada arising on the 22nd day of April, A.D. 1976.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">By the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975 </i>(Can.), (23-24-25 Eliz. II, c. 93, “The Amendment Act”) many provisions of the <i>Criminal Code </i>were amended or replaced, including ss. 235, 236 and 237 which are companion provisions relating to the offence created by s.&nbsp;236 of driving a motor vehicle with more than a specified proportion of alcohol in the blood.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The amendments to s, 235 were primarily designed to give police officers the right to require more than one sample of breath from a person suspected of a breach of ss. 234 or 236; prior to the amendments, only one sample could be required from a person suspected of having committed the offence described in s.&nbsp;234.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 236 is the main substantive provision; it is creative of the offence and while it was amended by the <i>Amendment Act, </i>it is common ground that the amendments are of no moment for the purpose of this case.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 237 deals essentially with the conditions under which a certificate of a qualified technician shall constitute <i>prima facie </i>evidence of its contents as to the proportion of alcohol in the blood of an</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 233]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">accused; prior to the amendment, the analysis of only one sample of breath was a sufficient basis for such a certificate; since the amendment, the certificate must be based upon not less than two samples before it may be accepted without further proof of its contents. (See <i>R. v. Noble</i><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[8]</span></span></span></a>.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The <i>Amendment Act </i>was assented to on March 30, 1976 and it provided that it was to come into force on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The amendments to ss. 235 and 237 that are relevant here came into force on April 26, 1976 and May 7, 1976 respectively.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The offence with which the respondent was charged was allegedly committed on April 22, 1976, after the passing of the <i>Amendment Act </i>and before the relevant amendments came into effect; however, these amendments had been proclaimed in force when the charge was laid and when the trial took place.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The question to be determined is whether the amendment to s.&nbsp;237 of the <i>Code </i>requiring that a certificate be based on not less than two samples of breath (rather than one) is applicable to an offence against s.&nbsp;236 that was committed when only one sample was required, where the charge was laid and the trial took place after the amendment had come into effect.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">His Honour Magistrate Luther, before whom the trial took place, held that the amendments to s.&nbsp;237 did not apply retrospectively and he convicted the respondent of the offence with which he was charged.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The conviction was appealed to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Trial Division, upon the stated case and the appeal was dismissed by judgment dated September 8, 1977 (Noel J.).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This judgment was appealed (with leave) to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Court of Appeal, which by a unanimous decision of February 8, 1978, allowed the appeal, answered the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 234]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">question in the affirmative and consequently quashed the conviction.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The basis of this decision of the Court of Appeal is found in the following passages of the reasons of Chief Justice Furlong and of Morgan J.A.; Chief Justice Furlong said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The nature of the offence with which the appellant was charged has not been altered by the amendment. The nature of the evidence which is required to sustain the charge has been varied. Thus it is impossible to regard the amendment as anything other than procedural in character. This then brings into operation the exception to the general rule against retrospection; there is nothing in the amending statute to limit its applicability to future offences, and I am satisfied that it applies to offences against S. 236 whenever they occurred.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Morgan J.A., whose reasons were concurred in by Gushue J.A., expressed the same view as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view Sec. 237 is worded generally so as to operate retrospectively as well as prospectively. It is a procedural provision providing for the admissibility of evidence before a Court when the matter is heard. It applies to future hearings after the amending sections&nbsp;are proclaimed in force and it applies even though the hearing is in respect of matters that arose before the sections&nbsp;were proclaimed in force.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The decision of the Court of Appeal is attacked on several grounds which may be summarized as follows: (a) the relevant amendments to s.&nbsp;237 of the <i>Code </i>are not purely procedural in character and should not therefore, in the absence of any adequate indication by Parliament, be construed to operate retrospectively and (b) even if the relevant amendments to s.&nbsp;237 were purely procedural in character, they should not be construed to operate retrospectively because Parliament has clearly expressed its intent to the contrary.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I propose to deal first with this second ground of attack, assuming therefore—but without deciding—that the Court of Appeal was correct when it characterized the amendments to s.&nbsp;237 as purely procedural.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 235]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is not in dispute that the rule as to the retrospective operation of procedural statutes is not absolute; it is only a guide that is intended to assist in the determination of the true intent of Parliament which is the main objective of statutory construction. This presumption in favour of the retrospective operation of procedural enactments must therefore yield to the contrary intent of Parliament; a procedural statute shall not be construed retrospectively when Parliament has expressed its intention to the contrary (see <i>Moon v. Durden</i><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Given the assumption afore-mentioned, the simple question for determination is whether Parliament has indicated its intent that the amendments to s.&nbsp;237 should operate prospectively only.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This amendment clearly related to substantive law; it gave police officers the right to demand more than one sample of breath so as to enable a proper analysis to be made and made it an offence for a suspect to refuse to give more than one sample of breath; before the amendment, only one suitable sample of breath could be demanded; thus, a person could, without committing an offence, refuse to give more than one sample. It is also clear that this amendment by its very nature may only apply prospectively; the requirement that the samples of breath be taken “forthwith” or within a prescribed time frame makes it a physical impossibility to give any retrospective effect to the new s.&nbsp;235 <i>Cr.c. </i>(see <i>Hickson v. Darlow</i><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[13]</span></span></span></a>;<i> Upper Canada College v.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The new s.&nbsp;237 applies to samples of breath taken under the new s.&nbsp;235; this is clear from the opening part of par. (<i>c</i>)<i> </i>which refers to “samples of the breath of the accused… pursuant to a demand made under subsection&nbsp;235(1)”. Under the old s.&nbsp;235, there could not be a demand for “samples” of breath, only for one sample. It follows that the prospective character of the new s.&nbsp;235 is determinative of the construction to be</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 239]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">placed in that regard upon the new s.&nbsp;237; it cannot be taken to refer to samples of breath that could not be legally demanded at the time of the offence. Also, the other amendments to the old s.&nbsp;237 make it abundantly clear that the new s.&nbsp;237 is intended to apply only when at least two samples of breath have been demanded and obtained which was not legally permissible under the old s.&nbsp;235.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Furthermore, it is apparent that the new s.&nbsp;237 cannot in fact operate retrospectively. When only one sample of breath has been taken because only one was required and could be demanded at the time, the law cannot make it possible for two samples to have been taken. The retrospective operation of the new s.&nbsp;237 which has been adopted by the Court of Appeal would effectively result in neither the new nor the old section&nbsp;being operative during the period when the new s.&nbsp;237 is supposedly intended to operate retrospectively. This can hardly have been the result that was intended by Parliament. Ever since the new offence now described in s.&nbsp;236 was created in 1969 by the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, </i>(1968-69 (Can.), c. 38, s.&nbsp;16), a special procedure has been available so as to ensure the effective investigation and punishment of this offence. It is indeed apparent that s.&nbsp;236 cannot, in practice, be effectively enforced in the absence of provisions similar to those now found in ss. 235 and 237. I have no reason to believe that Parliament intended, when passing the <i>Amendment Act </i>to allow for an interval during which the prosecution of offences already committed would be frustrated because the rules contained in ss. 235 and 237 would not be available for the enforcement of s.&nbsp;236 (<i>R. v. MacGregor</i><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[16]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>per Clement J.A., at p.&nbsp;406).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Another fundamental objection to the validity of the decision of the Court of Appeal rests on the rule of construction expressed in s.&nbsp;36(<i>d</i>)<i> </i>of the <i>Interpretation Act, </i>(R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23), which reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 240]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">36. Where an enactment (in this section&nbsp;called the “former enactment”) is repealed and another enactment (in this section&nbsp;called the “new enactment”) is substituted therefor,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-CA">…</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>d</i>)<i> </i>the procedure established by the new enactment shall be followed as far as it can be adapted thereto in the recovery or enforcement of penalties and forfeitures incurred, and in the enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the former enactment or in a proceeding in relation to matters that have happened before the repeal;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This statutory rule of construction is a modification of the common law rule; it imposes restrictions on what would otherwise be the retrospective operation, in the absence of any contrary intent, of procedural statutes. It prescribes that the retrospective operation of procedural enactments shall not be absolute, but will take place only to the extent that the new rules of procedure may be adapted to the proceedings taken in respect of the matter that has occurred before the new rules came into effect; this clearly means that the new procedure shall not apply retrospectively if or to the extent that it cannot be adapted. Here the new s.&nbsp;237 requires two samples of breath while the old s.&nbsp;237 allowed for only one. Clearly, the new procedure cannot be adapted; therefore, it does not apply to a sample of breath taken pursuant to the old s.&nbsp;235. This result would obtain under s.&nbsp;36 even though, contrary to what I have said above, s.&nbsp;237 were, under the rules of the common law, to be regarded as being retrospective in operation. Section 36 thus constitutes, in my opinion, an insurmountable obstacle to the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">We are in the situation where a procedural statute has been repealed and no new rule of procedure substituted for the old one “in relation to matters that have happened before the repeal”. This is precisely a case for the application of s.&nbsp;35 of the <i>Interpretation Act </i>which, generally, abrogates the common law rule “that, when an act of parliament is repealed, it must be considered (except as to transactions past and closed) as if it</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Subparagraphs (<i>b</i>)<i> </i>and (<i>e</i>), together with the concluding part of this section, are particularly relevant here. The saving clause contained in the last paragraph permits legal proceedings to be instituted and continued as if there had been no repeal; I have no doubt that it covers the procedure to be followed in respect to such proceeding. Otherwise, the clause would hardly have any practical meaning. Also, subpara. (<i>b</i>)<i> </i>serves to continue the effect of the certificate of analysis that was sought to be introduced into evidence by the Crown under the old s.&nbsp;237. This certificate of analysis was in respect of one sample of breath given pursuant to the old s.&nbsp;235; it was given when the old s.&nbsp;237 was still in force and it is conceded that it would be admissible evidence if this section&nbsp;had not been amended. It is also undisputable that the only object of this certificate, when it was given prior to the amended sections&nbsp;coming into force, was to serve as <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the facts stated therein in connection with a charge</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 242]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">that might be laid under ss. 234 or 236. Such a certificate would certainly be “affected” if because of the repeal of the section&nbsp;under which it was validly given it were deprived of all evidentiary value and would thus cease to have any usefulness at all. Section 35(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>is precisely intended to prevent such an undesirable result.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In support of the decision of the Court of Appeal, respondent has argued that Parliament’s intention to give a retrospective effect to the new s.&nbsp;237 was evidenced by the fact that the <i>Amendment Act </i>did not come into effect upon its passing, but only as from the day or days it was proclaimed in force. Reference was made to the English decision of <i>R. v. The Leeds and Bradford Railway Company</i><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[18]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>where Lord Campbell C.J., said at p.&nbsp;346:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">If it had been enacted that the provisions of the statute should come into operation immediately, I should have said that there was a hardship in their being construed retrospectively, and I should not have been willing so to construe them. But, here, the Act receiving the Royal assent on 14th <i>August, </i>sect. 38 directs that it “shall commence and take effect from the 2d day of <i>October </i>in the year of our Lord 1848.” That seems to be an intimation by the Legislature that they mean to give a time, whether long or short, within which bygone matters of complaint may be brought before justices, and the limitation avoided.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It should be observed that this decision was criticized by Rolfe B. in <i>Moon v. Durden </i>(<i>supra</i>),<i> </i>at pp. 33 and following. In <i>Re Athlumney</i><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[19]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>Wright J. said at p.&nbsp;553:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">…One exception to the general rule has sometimes been suggested, namely, that where, as here, the commencement of the operation of an Act is suspended for a time, this is an indication that no further restriction upon retrospective operation is intended. But this exception seems never to have been suggested except in relation to statutes affecting procedure, such as Statutes of Limitation, and even in relation to them it is questioned in <i>Moon v. Durden, </i>(<i>supra</i>).<i> </i>Moreover, ss. 6 and 8 of this Act have been held not to be retrospective, notwithstanding, though without reference to this suspensory clause: see <i>Re Raison, </i>((1891) 63 L.T. 709) and <i>Reg. v. Griffiths </i>([1891] 2 Q.B. 145).</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 243]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I know of no modern case that deals authoritatively with this issue and the existence of the rule, let alone its ambit, has been questioned by modern text book writers. According to Craies (<i>On Statute Law, </i>7th ed., p.&nbsp;395) the result of the court decisions is that the rule “cannot be accepted as an undoubted rule of construction”. In Odger’s <i>Construction of Deeds and Statutes, </i>5th ed., p.&nbsp;291, it is stated that “the rule is at least doubtful”, and in Maxwell <i>On Interpretation of Statutes, </i>12th ed., p.&nbsp;227, one reads “that the exception, if it does exist, is not of any wide application”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It would therefore appear to be unwise to treat the test suggested by Lord Campbell as a well established canon of construction. Furthermore, I fail to see how this rule, if it existed, could be so rigid as to apply to a situation that affords so many clear indications of a contrary intent on the part of Parliament.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Respondent also relied heavily on the decision of this Court in <i>Howard Smith Paper Mills Ltd. v.</i> <i>The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[20]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>where it was held that s.&nbsp;41 of the <i>Combines Investigation Act, </i>R.S.C. 1927, c.&nbsp;26, as enacted by 1949 (2nd Session), c. 12, s.&nbsp;3, was procedural in character. Such determination having been made, the question did not arise, evidently because of the nature of the enactment, as to whether s.&nbsp;41, although procedural in character, should nevertheless be construed prospectively because of the manifested intent of Parliament. The decision of our Court in <i>Howard Smith </i>does not bear at all on the question I have discussed so far and given the assumption that I have made as to the procedural character of s.&nbsp;237, I fail to see how it can afford any assistance to the respondent.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Being of the view that the appeal should succeed even if the new s.&nbsp;237 were to be regarded as procedural in character, I do not find it necessary to express any opinion as to the validity of the first ground of attack advanced by appellant against the decision of the Court of Appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 244]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am therefore of the opinion that the question of law expressed in the stated case should be answered in the negative; it follows that the appeal should be allowed, the decision of the Court of Appeal set aside and the conviction pronounced against the respondent on May 5, 1977 by His Honour Magistrate Donald Luther restored. In accordance with the terms of the order granting leave, the costs of the respondent in this Court are to be borne by the appellant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Disposition"><i><span lang="FR-CA">Appeal allowed, conviction restored, RITCHIE and ESTEY JJ. dissenting.</span></i></p>
