 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provocation is a partial defence exclusive to homicide which reduces the conviction from murder to manslaughter.&nbsp; There is both an objective and a subjective component to provocation in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec232" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;232<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Once it is established that the wrongful act or insult was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control, the inquiry turns to a consideration of the subjective element of the defence, which is whether the accused acted in response to the provocation and on the sudden before there was time for his or her passion to cool.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The “ordinary person” standard is informed by contemporary norms of behaviour, including fundamental values such as the commitment to equality provided for in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The accused must have a justifiable sense of being wronged.&nbsp; A central concern with the objective standard has been the extent to which the accused’s own personal characteristics and circumstances should be considered.&nbsp; A restrictive approach to the “ordinary person” approach ignores relevant contextual circumstances.&nbsp; Conversely, an individualized approach would lead to anomalous results if all the accused’s characteristics were taken into account; it would also ignore the cardinal principle that the criminal law is concerned with setting standards of human behaviour.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important not to subvert the logic of the objective inquiry.&nbsp; The proper approach is one that takes into account some, but not all, of the individual characteristics of the accused.&nbsp; Personal circumstances may be relevant to determining whether the accused was in fact provoked — the subjective element of the defence — but they do not shift the ordinary person standard to suit the individual accused.&nbsp; There is an important distinction between contextualizing the objective standard, which is necessary and proper, and individualizing it, which would only serve to defeat its purpose.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjective element of the defence of provocation focuses on the accused’s subjective perceptions of the circumstances, including what the accused believed, intended or knew.&nbsp; The accused must have killed because he was provoked and not merely because the provocation existed.&nbsp; The requirement of suddenness serves to distinguish a response taken in vengeance from one that was provoked.&nbsp; Suddenness applies to both the act of provocation and the accused’s reaction to it.</span></p>

Hill</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 313, Dickson C.J. identified three general requirements for the defence of provocation:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-CA">First, the provoking wrongful act or insult must be of such a nature that it would deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control.&nbsp; That is the initial threshold which must be surmounted.&nbsp; Secondly, the accused must actually have been provoked.&nbsp; As I have earlier indicated, these two elements are often referred to as the objective and subjective tests of provocation respectively.&nbsp; Thirdly, the accused must have acted on the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his or her passion to cool.&nbsp; [p. 324]</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>R. v. Thibert</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, Cory J. for the majority of the Court collapsed these three requirements into two elements, one objective and the other subjective, describing them as follows:</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-CA">First, there must be a wrongful act or insult of such a nature that it is sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control as the objective element.&nbsp; Second, the subjective element requires that the accused act upon that insult on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original deleted; para. 4.]</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">Subsequently, in <i>R. v. Parent</i>, 2001 SCC 30, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 761, the Court reiterated the test in <i>Thibert</i> but framed it in terms of four required elements:</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-CA">. . . (1) a wrongful act or insult that would have caused an ordinary person to be deprived of his or her self-control; (2) which is sudden and unexpected; (3) which in fact caused the accused to act in anger; (4) before having recovered his or her normal control . . . .

R. Sullivan, “Anger and Excuse: Reassessing Provocation” (1993), 13 <i>Oxford J. Leg. Stud.</i> 421, at p. 422.</span></p>

Mawgridge </i>(1707), Kel J. 119, 84 E.R. 1107, Lord Holt C.J. set out four categories of provocation.&nbsp; One category envisaged a husband catching a man in the act of adultery with his wife.&nbsp; The basis of the provocation, he wrote, was that “jealousy is the rage of a man, and adultery is the highest invasion of property” (p. 1115).&nbsp; Interestingly, while the killing of a sexual rival caught in the act of committing adultery with one’s wife was seen as a proper basis for the defence, the killing of one’s wife for infidelity was not:&nbsp; F. Stewart and A. Freiberg, <i>Provocation in Sentencing Research Report</i> (2nd ed. 2009), at para.&nbsp;2.1.2.&nbsp; Another category included an “affron[t]” of “pulling . . . the nose, or filliping upon the forehead” (<i>Mawgridge</i>, at p. 1114).&nbsp; These categories carried the vestiges of a social view that privileged notions of preserving a man’s honour.&nbsp; As Sullivan has described it:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">A violent response in such circumstances was not so much a matter to be condoned but to be required of a man of honour.&nbsp; The core perception of mitigating anger at this time was not of an emotion rendering the agent out of control but as a hot-blooded response informed and controlled by a rational understanding of the nature and degree of the provocation offered.&nbsp; It was a case of hot-blooded yet controlled vindication of one’s honour rather than spontaneous, uncontrolled fury. [p. 422]</span></p>

Hayward</i> (1833), 6 Car. &amp; P. 157, 172 E.R. 1188, at p. 1189, Tindal C.J. told the jury that the defence was derived from the law’s “compassion to human infirmity”.&nbsp; The Law Commissioners’ Digest of 1839 provided that the provocative conduct must be “a wrongful act or insult”, which required that the conduct be inherently offensive (Law Commission of Great Britain, <i>Partial Defences to Murder</i>, Consultation Paper No.&nbsp;173 (2003), at para. 1.27, citing “Fourth Report of Her Majesty’s Commissioners on Criminal Law”, in <i>Reports from Commissioners</i> (1839), 235).&nbsp; These developments occurred at the same time as another critical one.&nbsp; While an objective standard was always implicit in the defence, a more formal standard of self-control expected to be exercised by the “reasonable <span style="color:black">man</span>” in the circumstances was eventually proposed:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Welsh</i> (1869), 11 Cox C.C. 336.&nbsp; Ultimately, the objective element came to play a heightened role in the operation of the defence as the recognized grounds of provocation were abandoned (see T. Macklem, “Provocation and the Ordinary Person” (1987-1988), 11 <i>Dal. L.J.</i> 126, at p. 130).</span></p>

Roach rightly observes:&nbsp; “As a partial defence that reduces murder to manslaughter, provocation does not fit easily into the excuse/justification framework” (<i>Criminal Law </i>(4th ed.<i> </i>2009), at p. 358).&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Manchuk</i>, [1938] S.C.R. 18, at pp. 19-20, this Court explained that “provocation . . . neither justifies nor excuses the act of homicide.&nbsp; But the law accounts the act and the violent feelings which prompted it less blameable because of the passion aroused by the provocation, . . . though still sufficiently blameable to merit punishment ― and it may be punishment of high severity ― but not the extreme punishment of death.”</span></p>

Haight </i>(1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 168 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 175, and <i>R. v. Galgay</i>, [1972] 2 O.R. 630 (C.A.), at p. 649).&nbsp; Interpreted in this manner, the notion of legal right serves to carve out from the ambit of s. 232 legally sanctioned conduct which otherwise could amount, in fact, to an “insult”.</span></p>
 <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

 <p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-CA">Yet, I think the objective element should be taken as an attempt to weigh in the balance those very human frailties which sometimes lead people to act irrationally and impulsively against the need to protect society by discouraging acts of homicidal violence.&nbsp; [para. 4]</span></p>

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1119 (H.L.); <i>Salamon v. The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1959] S.C.R. 404; <i>Wright v.

 <p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-CA">. . . the “collective good sense” of the jury will naturally lead it to ascribe to the ordinary person any general characteristics relevant to the provocation in question.&nbsp; For example, if the provocation is a racial slur, the jury will think of an ordinary person with the racial background that forms the substance of the insult.&nbsp; To this extent, particular characteristics will be ascribed to the ordinary person.&nbsp; Indeed, it would be impossible to conceptualize a sexless or ageless ordinary person.&nbsp; Features such as sex, age, or race, do not detract from a person’s characterization as ordinary.&nbsp; Thus particular characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an ordinary person <u>without subverting the logic of the objective test of provocation</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 331.]</span></p>

 <p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-CA">The law fixes a standard for all which must be met before reliance may be placed on the provocation defence.&nbsp; Everyone, whatever his or her idiosyncracies, is expected to observe that standard.&nbsp; It is not every insult or injury that will be sufficient to relieve a person from what would otherwise be murder.&nbsp; The “ordinary person” standard is adopted to fix the degree of self-control and restraint expected of all in society.&nbsp; [p. 336]</span></p>

Tripodi</i>,<i> </i>[1955] S.C.R. 438, at p. 443).&nbsp; Further, the intentional killing must have been committed by the accused “before there was time for his passion to cool”:&nbsp; <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec232subsec2" target="_blank">s. 232(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

Fontaine</i>, 2004 SCC 27, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at para. 56, citing <i>R. v. Schwartz</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443).</span></p>

 <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

 <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-CA">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">As for the objective element of the defence, the appellant does not suggest that he was provoked by a “wrongful act”.&nbsp; Rather, his contention is that, in the context of his relationship with Ms. Duong, his discovery of her sexual involvement with Mr. An Tran amounted to an insult at law.&nbsp; The facts do not support this contention.</span></p>
 <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-CA">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">First, it is difficult to see how the conduct of Ms. Duong and Mr. An Tran could constitute an insult on any ordinary meaning of the word.&nbsp; The general meaning of the noun “insult” as defined in the <i>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles</i> (6th ed. 2007), vol. 1, at p. 1400, is “[a]n act or the action of attacking; (an) attack, (an) assault.”&nbsp; Likewise, the action of insulting means to “[s]how arrogance or scorn; boast, exult, esp. insolently or contemptuously. . . . Treat with scornful abuse; subject to indignity; . . . offend the modesty or self-respect of.”&nbsp; Here, Ms. Duong and Mr. An Tran were alone in the privacy of her bedroom, neither wanting nor expecting the appellant to show up.&nbsp; In these circumstances, I agree with Hunt J.A. that “[n]othing done by the complainant or the victim comes close to meeting the definition of insult.&nbsp; Their behaviour was not only lawful, it was discreet and private and entirely passive vis-à-vis the [appellant].&nbsp; They took pains to keep their relationship hidden. . . . Their behaviour came to his attention only because he gained access to the building by falsely saying he was there to pick up his mail” (para. 17).</span></p>
 <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-CA">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Further, there was nothing sudden about the discovery.&nbsp; The appellant is the one whose appearance came as a total surprise to Ms. Duong and Mr. An Tran, not the other way around.&nbsp; On the factual findings made by the trial judge, the appellant had not only suspected his wife’s relationship with another man, but he made deliberate attempts to surveillance her activity, including by eavesdropping on her conversations.&nbsp; The night before the tragic events, the appellant told his godmother that he now knew who the man was whom his wife was seeing (trial judge’s reasons, at p. 26).&nbsp; Therefore, it cannot be said that his discovery, upon entering Ms. Duong’s bedroom unannounced and uninvited, “str[uck] upon a mind unprepared for it”.</span></p>
 <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

 <p class="Citation"><span lang="EN-CA">was measuring his actions on what he was saying and doing.&nbsp; The trial judge should have addressed whether he could have regained his self control by the time he went into the living room and finished off the victim — not merely whether he was still angry and excited.&nbsp; The trial judge found his anger continued but she failed to direct herself to consider whether the continuation of his anger amounted to a continuing lack of the power of self control without an opportunity to recover it. [para. 76]</span></p>
 <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-CA">As Watson J.A. rightly concluded, “there was on the trial judge’s fact findings no air of reality to his acting on the sudden at the time of the killing” (para. 77).</span></p>
