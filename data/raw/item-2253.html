 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">A black accused was charged with robbing an East Indian man.&nbsp; The accused sought to challenge potential jurors for cause, arguing that jurors who are East Indian may feel a natural sympathy for a victim of the same race and that race‑based sympathy for the victim aggravates or compounds the potential racial prejudice against a black accused.&nbsp; The trial judge permitted the defence to challenge potential jurors for cause on the basis of potential bias against a black accused but, exercising his discretion, refused to extend the challenge to include the race of the complainant, as he regarded the “interracial” element on the facts of this case to be irrelevant.&nbsp; At trial, the accused was convicted.&nbsp; On appeal, he argued that he was deprived of his right to an impartial jury and therefore to a fair trial.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction, holding that if an accused who is entitled to challenge the jury for cause wishes to include the interracial nature of the crime in the question for potential jurors, he is entitled to have the question posed in that way.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">It was up to the defence to show an “air of reality” to the assertion that the complainant’s East Indian origin has the realistic potential of aggravating jurors’&nbsp;prejudice against the black accused.&nbsp; This burden was not met.&nbsp; While it was open to the trial judge to include the “interracial” aspect of the crime in the challenge for cause, neither the case law, nor the studies on which the case law is based, compelled him to exercise his discretion in that way.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">People called for jury duty benefit from a presumption that they will do their duty without bias or partiality.&nbsp; To rebut the presumption, there must exist a realistic potential for the existence of partiality, on a ground sufficiently articulated in the application, before the challenge for cause should be allowed to proceed.&nbsp; To establish a realistic potential for juror partiality generally requires satisfying the court that:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;a widespread bias exists in the community; and (2)&nbsp;some jurors may be incapable of setting aside this bias, despite trial safeguards, to render an impartial decision.&nbsp; Where widespread racial bias is shown, the second element may be inferred and need not necessarily be established by reports or studies.&nbsp;[21] [23] [26] [35]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The studies and reports cited in the <i>Parks</i> decision do not establish a realistic possibility that a potential juror who could impartially judge the accused despite his being black would lose that impartiality on realizing that the victim was East Indian.&nbsp; <i>Parks</i> does not hold that a potential “sympathy factor” exists between jurors and complainants in all situations where both are members of the same visible minority.&nbsp; The general statements made in the case law about interracial crime have to be considered in their context.&nbsp; Those cases dealt with interracial crime as a potentially aggravating circumstance in the minds of the white majority against a member of a visible minority.&nbsp; They do not support a generalized conclusion that race‑based natural sympathy affects all trials where the accused, complainant, principal witnesses and jurors are not all of the same race. [40] [42] [47]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">In this case, the majority of the Court of Appeal pushed judicial notice beyond its proper limits.&nbsp; While courts have properly taken notice of the widespread existence of racism, and the likelihood that anti‑black racism is aggravated when the alleged victim is white, there is no similar consensus that “everybody knows” a juror of a particular race is likely to favour a complainant or witness of the same race, despite the trial safeguards and the trial judge’s instruction to the contrary. [7] [52]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The permissible scope of judicial notice varies according to the nature of the issue under consideration, and the closer a fact approaches the dispositive issue the more a court ought to insist on compliance with the stricter criteria for judicial recognition.&nbsp; Under the strict criteria accepted by this Court in <i>Find</i>, a court may properly take judicial notice of facts that are either (1)&nbsp;so notorious or generally accepted as not to be the subject of debate among reasonable persons, or (2)&nbsp;capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy. [53] [60‑61]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">It could be argued that the requirements of judicial notice accepted in <i>Find</i> should be relaxed in relation to such matters as laying a factual basis for the exercise of a discretion to permit challenges for cause.&nbsp; These are matters difficult to prove, and they do not strictly relate to the adjudication of guilt or innocence, but rather to the framework within which that adjudication is to take place.&nbsp; Such non‑adjudicative facts are now generally called “social facts” when they relate to the fact‑finding process and “legislative facts” in relation to legislation or judicial policy. [56]</p>
</div> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>
<div class="Section6">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">In dealing with “legislative” facts and “social” facts, greater scope may be given to judicial notice, but a court must still ask itself whether the alleged fact would be accepted by reasonable people who have properly informed themselves on the topic as not subject to reasonable dispute for the purpose for which it is to be used, keeping in mind that the need for reliability and trustworthiness increases directly with the centrality of the “fact” to the disposition of the issue in question. [65]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">Here, the Court is asked to make some fundamental shifts in the laws’&nbsp;understanding of how juries function and how the selection of their members should be approached.&nbsp; To take judicial notice of the “social facts” of the race‑based “natural sympathy” theory would be dispositive of the appeal, yet these facts are neither notorious nor easily verified by reference to works of indisputable accuracy, nor the subject of informed consensus.&nbsp; To take judicial notice of such matters for this purpose would be to take even a generous view of judicial notice a leap too far. [67]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">On the existing state of the law, it was within the trial judge’s discretion to limit the challenge of potential jurors to the race of the accused.&nbsp; The right to challenge for cause is not automatic.&nbsp; In each case, the trial judge must determine whether there is an air of reality to the challenge on the particular circumstances of each case.&nbsp; Here, while the fact the accused was black called for a challenge for cause on that basis, the additional fact of the complainant being of East Indian origin was not shown to compound the prejudice and, therefore, did not need to be the subject of a separate inquiry to potential jurors.&nbsp; On the facts, a broader inquiry would certainly have been permissible, but it was not an error of law for the trial judge to draw the line where he did. [7] [71‑72]</p>

<div class="Section7">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">Trial fairness trumps technicalities.&nbsp; If the trial judge were persuaded that the appearance of fairness to the respondent accused required the full <i>Parks</i> question, he ought to have permitted it, regardless of his recollection of the <i>Parks</i> question, the state of the social science or the nuanced limits of judicial notice.&nbsp; The question, however, is where the Court draws the “fairness” line.&nbsp; Here, the only issue of importance to the defence was identification.&nbsp; Neither the race of the complainant nor his testimony of what happened shed any light on identification. In the circumstances of this case the trial judge did not think that leaving out the interracial element was unfair.&nbsp; That was a determination he was entitled to make. [76‑77]</p>

Williams</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128.&nbsp; It is not at all apparent, however, that as defence counsel put it in oral argument, “a potential juror, seeing a victim of his or her own race, there might be that sympathy, natural sympathy, or tendency to favour someone of your own race, [whether] minorities or majorities” (transcript, at p. 6).&nbsp; Such a proposition, it seems to me, takes us beyond the legitimate sphere of judicial notice.&nbsp; There “might” be the “natural sympathy” suggested by the defence, but there might not be.&nbsp; Moreover, if such a “positive” partiality exists, will it not be neutralized by the solemn procedures of the trial and strict instructions from the trial judge?&nbsp; That is the question.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The eventual logic of the defence argument, it seems, is that courts should take judicial notice of a “realistic possibility” of racial partiality in every case where the jurors, accused, complainant and witnesses are not all of the same race.&nbsp; Might this race-centred view of the jury system be pushed into other areas of discrimination?&nbsp; Do Catholics or Hindus more readily believe witnesses who are disclosed to be of the same faith?&nbsp; Do male jurors “empathize” more with male complainants than with female complainants?&nbsp; Does this empathy translate into real (or reasonably perceived) bias?&nbsp; Is race a more powerful motivator than these other sources of potential bias? Our traditional belief was that the diversity of 12 jurors would iron out and diffuse such individual variations.</p>

Koh </i>(1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp; The majority allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial.</p>

In his view, the question permitted by the trial judge adequately protected Mr. Spence’s right to an impartial jury and, therefore, to a fair trial (para.&nbsp;48).&nbsp; The context in which the courts in <i>Williams</i>, <i>Parks </i>and <i>R. v. Campbell</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 258 (Ont. C.A.), approved the “interracial” question differed profoundly from the context of this appeal.&nbsp; In cases where the accused is a member of a minority community and the victim is white, one can readily understand how the interracial nature of the crime may increase the potential for juror partiality and why, therefore, a question that includes the race of the victim is essential to ensure a fair trial (paras. 57-59).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Wilson</i> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 86 (Ont. C.A.)), or ignore relevant factors, but it does mean that allowing a challenge for cause to proceed is not “automatic” even in matters touching on race (<i>Williams</i>, at para. 41).&nbsp;</p>

Parnell</i> (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 83 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 94.)&nbsp; A third problem is that judges occasionally contradict each other about some “fact” that “everybody” knows, even on the same court in the same case.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Campbell v. Royal Bank of Canada</i>, [1964] S.C.R. 85, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting, pointed out, at p.&nbsp;91, that the majority and dissenting judges in the court below had taken judicial notice of flatly contradictory facts, namely whether it was usual or unusual to find water in substantial quantities on the floor of a Manitoba bank in wintertime.&nbsp; More dramatically, in <i>Clinton v. Jones</i>, 520 U.S. 681 (1997), where the issue before the Supreme Court of the United States was whether a sitting President is entitled to automatic immunity during his term of office with respect to private conduct prior to his election to the presidency, the court stated with confidence with respect to the Paula Jones affair that “it appears to us highly unlikely to occupy any substantial amount of petitioner’s time” (p. 702).</p>

McCormick, who wrote that “a ruling that a fact will be judicially noticed precludes contradictory evidence”; see “Judicial Notice” (1951-1952), 5 <i>Vand. L. Rev. </i>296, at p.&nbsp;322.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Zundel</i> (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), the court said that “[t]he generally accepted modern view .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is that where the court takes judicial notice of a matter, the judicial notice is final” (p. 150).&nbsp; On this view, acceptance through judicial notice of the broad race-based thesis of the intervener African Canadian Legal Clinic would not only stretch the elasticity of judicial notice, it would create a set of irrebutable presumptions about how individuals called to jury duty can be expected to think.&nbsp; If there is one thing most of the social science studies agree upon, it is that much work remains to be done in Canada within the limits imposed by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec649" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;649<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> to clarify our working assumptions about jury behaviour.</p>

Lavallee</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, or the effect of the “feminization of poverty” judicially noticed in <i>Moge v.

Bagby and N.&nbsp;A. Rector, “Prejudicial Attitudes in a Simulated Legal Context” (1991), 11 <i>Health L.

The study found that English speaking Canadians viewed French speaking Canadians more positively than either English or native Canadians.&nbsp; The victim was viewed more positively when she was French, and the accused was seen as more guilty when the victim was French.&nbsp; Can such complications of race and ethnicity be followed up as a matter of fairness without embracing the American model which, to date, Canadian courts have declined to do?</p>
