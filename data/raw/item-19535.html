The assaults continued on a frequent basis over a five‑year timeframe. At age 27, N sexually assaulted another niece, who was 15 years old, when she stayed overnight at the home N shared with his parents. N pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought a global sentence of four to six years, while N sought a global sentence of three to three and a half years. The sentencing judge imposed a global sentence of eight years. N appealed, submitting, among other grounds, that the sentencing judge erred by failing to alert counsel that she planned to impose a sentence in excess of that sought by Crown counsel.

Anthony‑Cook</i>, 2016 SCC 43, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 204, which instructs judges not to depart from a joint sentencing submission unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest, must remain confined to joint submissions. It does not, and should not, apply to contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea. However, if the sentencing judge presiding over a contested sentencing hearing is of a mind to impose a harsher sentence than what the Crown has proposed, they should notify the parties and give them an opportunity to make further submissions, failing which they run the risk of having the harsher sentence overturned on appeal.</span></p>

Its stringency is designed to protect the unique benefits that flow from joint submissions. Unlike joint submissions, contested sentencings following a guilty plea do not offer, to the same degree, the benefits that <i>Anthony‑Cook </i>sought to protect: certainty and efficiency. Contested sentencing hearings are characterized by a lack of agreement on a specific sentence, and therefore cannot offer the same degree of certainty as joint submissions. In addition, contested sentencing hearings are significantly less efficient than joint submissions. Although both save the justice system and its participants the time, stress, and cost of a trial, a contested sentencing requires the parties to prepare for and provide comprehensive submissions at a sentencing hearing.</span></p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the public interest test applied to both joint submissions and contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea, joint submissions would lose much of their attraction. They would no longer offer an unparalleled certainty as to the length of the accused’s sentence, since contested sentencing hearings would offer a similar certainty. In addition, contested sentencing hearings would offer an added benefit to the accused that joint submissions would not: the possibility of a lower sentence. </span>If joint submissions were frequently replaced with contested sentencing hearings, this would result in more lengthy and time‑consuming sentencing hearings, thereby placing an even greater strain on a justice system that is already overburdened. Furthermore, if the public interest test applied to contested sentencing hearings, the sentencing judge’s role to craft fit sentences that are proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility would be partially usurped and offloaded onto the Crown. The sentencing judge’s discretion would be limited, as the lengths of sentences would be effectively capped at the Crown’s proposed upper range.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sentencing judges presiding over contested sentencing hearings are required to notify parties and provide an opportunity for further submissions if they plan to impose a harsher sentence than what the Crown has proposed. A sentencing judge should let the parties know as soon as possible if they are concerned that the Crown’s proposed sentence is, or may be, too lenient and they are contemplating exceeding it. Adequate notice does not require the judge to set out in detail what it is that they find troublesome with the Crown’s proposed sentence; they should, however, do so whenever possible. It is enough for a judge to advise the parties that, in their view, the sentence proposed by the Crown appears too lenient, having regard to the seriousness of the offence and/or the degree of responsibility of the accused. The opportunity for further submissions should not be relied on by the parties as a chance to pull a rabbit out of the hat; it is critical that both the Crown and the accused initially provide as much relevant information as possible in support of their respective positions. Additional submissions, they should respond to the concerns raised by the sentencing judge, including matters that the parties considered irrelevant or simply overlooked in their initial submissions.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sentencing judge’s failure to provide notice and the opportunity for further submissions is not a breach of procedural fairness but an error in principle that will only justify appellate intervention where it appears from the judge’s decision that such an error had an impact on the sentence. In these circumstances,<span style="line-height:200%"> the appellant must demonstrate that there was information that they could have provided, if given the opportunity to do so, and it must appear to the appellate court that this information would have impacted the sentence. In assessing impact, the focus should be on whether the missing information is material to the sentence at issue. Appellate intervention is also warranted where the sentencing judge failed to provide reasons, or provided unclear or insufficient reasons, for imposing the harsher sentence. Lastly, an appellate court may intervene if the sentencing judge relied on flawed or unsupportable reasoning for imposing the harsher sentence, such as the erroneous consideration of an aggravating factor or misapprehension of relevant authorities.</span></p>

The sentencing judge provided adequate reasons for why she exceeded the Crown range and </span>her reasons for exceeding the Crown range, when read as a whole, were not erroneous.

(dissenting): There is agreement with the majority that the public interest test from <i>Anthony‑Cook</i> is reserved for joint submissions. There is further agreement that a sentencing judge considering a harsher sentence than that proposed by the Crown is required to advise the parties and invite further submissions. The disagreement with the majority lies with the question of remedy when a judge fails to follow this procedure.</span></p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a contested sentencing hearing where a sentencing judge is planning to impose a harsher sentence than that proposed by the Crown, the failure to advise counsel or invite further submissions is a breach of procedural fairness because it denies the parties adequate notice of the case to meet and the right to be heard. The flawed procedure impacts the parties’ ability to make meaningful submissions, which might have addressed the judge’s concerns. This creates a heightened risk that the judge will impose a sentence without all of the relevant information that might have been provided. </span>If the parties knew the judge was considering a harsher sentence than proposed by the Crown, either party could seek to provide further information, evidence or argument to address the judge’s concerns, or provide additional authorities not previously brought to the judge’s attention.<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"> </span><span style="line-height:200%">Given the adversarial nature of sentencing proceedings, it is unrealistic to expect that the parties will initially adduce all potentially relevant information. </span>If counsel were expected to adduce<i> </i>all relevant information, in an effort to pre‑empt every potential concern of the sentencing judge, this would result in more lengthy and time‑consuming sentencing hearings, thereby placing an even greater strain on the justice system.</p>

It is neither appropriate nor helpful to try to fit the analysis of procedural unfairness into the framework for appellate intervention set out in <i>R. v. Lacasse</i>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, and <i>R. v. Friesen</i>, 2020 SCC 9. The decisions in <i>Lacasse</i> and <i>Friesen</i> do not detract from the Court’s longstanding recognition that p<span style="line-height:200%">rocedural unfairness is an independent basis for reviewing decisions affecting an individual’s rights and interests. The inquiry into procedural fairness is distinct from the inquiry into whether a sentence is unfit or whether there has been an error in principle that impacted the sentence. Procedural fairness asks whether the sentence arrived at was the product of a fair procedure. A breach of procedural fairness impacts the right to a fair hearing and confidence in the process, regardless of whether or not the result is consistent with the purposes, principles and objectives of sentencing.</span></p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a sentencing judge imposes a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes without providing notice or inviting further submissions, the breach of procedural fairness may impact the sentence precisely because it is not possible to say whether further submissions would have impacted the sentence. In these circumstances, it is necessary to set the decision aside and conduct the sentencing afresh in order to restore fairness and the appearance of fairness to the proceedings. Thus, it is not necessary for the accused to demonstrate that the breach of procedural fairness caused actual prejudice. Where a court of appeal determines that there has been a breach of procedural fairness requiring the sentencing decision to be set aside, it must perform its own sentencing analysis without deference to the decision of first instance. Irrespective of the outcome of sentencing afresh, it is essential that fairness and the appearance of fairness have been restored.</span></p>

The test, adopted by this Court in <i>R. v. Anthony-Cook</i>, 2016 SCC 43, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 204, instructs judges not to depart from a joint submission unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or is otherwise contrary to the public interest. Sentencing judges must not reject a joint submission lightly. They should only do so where the proposed sentence would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par2" class="">2</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The stringency of this test is designed to protect the unique benefits that flow from joint submissions. It provides the parties with a high degree of certainty that the sentence jointly proposed will be the sentence imposed, and it avoids the need for lengthy, costly, and contentious trials. As a rule, joint submission sentencing hearings are expeditious and straightforward. They save precious time, resources, and expenses which can be channeled into other court matters. In short, they enable the justice system to function efficiently and effectively. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par3" class="">3</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee, asks the Court to extend the <i>Anthony-Cook</i> public interest test from joint submissions — where the Crown and the defence agree on every aspect of the sentence — to contested sentencing hearings, where they do not. In his particular case, he proposes that the public interest test apply where the Crown and the defence have put forward different sentencing ranges to the judge following a guilty plea, on the understanding that the Crown would not ask for a sentence that exceeds the high end of its sentencing range and the defence would not ask for a sentence that falls below the low end of its sentencing range. He submits that this extension of <i>Anthony-Cook</i> is an incremental change in the law. With respect, I disagree.</p>

In such cases, however, if the sentencing judge is of a mind to impose a harsher sentence, in any respect, than what the Crown has proposed, they should notify the parties and give them an opportunity to make further submissions — failing which, they run the risk of having the harsher sentence overturned on appeal for any one of the following three errors in principle: </p>

This sentence exceeded the upper end of the sentencing range proposed by the Crown by two years. The sentencing judge did not provide notice that she planned to exceed the upper end of the Crown range, nor did she provide an opportunity for further submissions. Nonetheless, in my view, Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee has not shown that there was information he could have provided that would have impacted on the sentence; nor do the reasons of the sentencing judge disclose error. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal. </p>

In her first year at her grandparents’, E.N. awoke repeatedly to Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee digitally penetrating her vagina. Later that year, Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee forced her to engage in unprotected sexual intercourse. As she got older, she was able to resist the assaults by kicking him away. Regardless, he continued returning to her bedroom night after night. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par8" class="">8</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.N. lost track of the number of assaults because they happened so frequently. The final assault, to which Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee admitted, fell outside the five-year timeframe captured by his guilty plea. Now 21 years old, E.N. returned to visit her grandparents. While she was sleeping next to her boyfriend, Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee put his hands under her shorts and tried to remove her underwear. She kicked him away.</p>

E.N. struggled with self-esteem. Her schooling, friendships, and family relationships suffered. She felt unable to disclose the abuse to her family for fear that it would tear them apart. Moreover, she felt that she had nowhere else to go. In her later high school years, she found herself physically and emotionally exhausted from losing sleep every night while fending off Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s attacks. Years of abuse left her feeling disgusted with herself and not worthy of healthy relationships. </p>

S.R. was staying overnight with her grandparents because her mother thought it would be safer for her to sleep there, rather than returning home by bus late at night. While S.R. was asleep in the same room as three of her younger cousins, she awoke to find Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee pushing his fingers inside her vagina. He then proceeded to have unprotected sexual intercourse with her. </p>

As with E.N., her grandmother had disbelieved S.R. She accused S.R. of being vindictive and having mental health problems. S.R. was ostracized from much of the family for reporting to the police the assault that formed the basis of Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s plea.</p>

In E.N.’s case, there were eight instances of sexual intercourse. In S.R.’s case, other aggravating features included that: there was a 12-year age difference between S.R. and Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee; the assault was “not an isolated incident” (sentencing reasons, at para. 91); it was brazenly committed while other children slept nearby; and Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee had initially attempted to shift blame onto S.R. </p>

He also had a good work history, a supportive family in the community, and abided by his bail conditions. Although Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee demonstrated limited insight into the gravity of his crimes, Smith&nbsp;Prov.&nbsp;Ct.&nbsp;J. found that his expression of remorse was genuine and that he voiced a need and willingness to undergo treatment in the future. </p>

She reviewed the <i>Gladue </i>report, the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s mother, and Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s background, and found that none of the personal mitigating factors often present in cases of Indigenous offenders existed here. Hence, there was no basis to reduce his blameworthiness on account of his Indigeneity. Although Smith&nbsp;Prov.&nbsp;Ct.&nbsp;J. took into account his family’s historic experiences, including his grandparents’ and father’s attendance at residential schools, this was partly offset by the fact that both victims were Indigenous females who were more vulnerable to sexual assault than non-Indigenous women.</p>

The court did not accept Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s submissions that the sentencing judge erred by: (1) failing to alert counsel that she planned to impose a sentence in excess of that sought by Crown counsel; (2) imposing a demonstrably unfit sentence; (3) incorrectly applying statutory and common law aggravating factors; and (4) failing to properly consider his Indigenous heritage.

R.R.B.</i>, 2013 BCCA 224, 338 B.C.A.C. 106, which held that, while it is preferable for a judge to notify parties that they plan to impose a sentence greater than that sought by the Crown and invite further submissions, failure to do so does not amount to reversible error. Nor did the court agree with Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee that <i>R.R.B. </i>had been overtaken by <i>Anthony-Cook</i>, such that the public interest test should apply to the negotiated sentencing ranges in his case. In the court’s view,<i> R.R.B. </i>was distinguishable because, like Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s case, it dealt with a contested sentencing rather than a joint submission, which was the sole focus of <i>Anthony-Cook</i>. </p>

In this regard, the evidence Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee said he would have introduced at trial — that his second guilty plea, to the offence against E.N., was only entered after he was assured of the Crown’s sentencing position — was before the judge. The judge was told by defence counsel that Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee entered his second guilty plea following “extensive resolution discussions” that included “a thorough statement of facts and [the] Crown’s sentencing [position]” (C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;56). There was no prejudice to Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee warranting interference with his sentence.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.5in;margin-left:58.3pt;line-height:normal">Rejection [of a joint submission] denotes a submission so unhinged from the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance would lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant circumstances, including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had broken down. </p>

It is meant to encourage agreement between the parties, which saves court time at sentencing. The test also incentivizes guilty pleas, sparing victims and the justice system the need for costly, time-consuming trials (<i>Anthony-Cook</i>, at paras. 35 and 40). Accused persons benefit because they have a very high degree of certainty that the sentence jointly proposed will be the sentence they receive; and the Crown benefits because it is assured of a guilty plea on terms it is prepared to accept (paras. 36-39).

To the extent that the parties may agree to most, but not all, aspects of the sentence — be it the length or type of the sentence, or conditions, terms, or ancillary orders attached to it — the submission will not constitute a joint submission. The public interest test does not apply to bits and pieces of a sentence upon which the parties are in agreement; it applies across the board, or not at all. Apart from the logistical problems of applying two different tests to parts of the same proposed sentence, at the end of the day, there is only one composite sentence. Arriving at a sentence involves an assessment of all of its component parts. Isolating one or two parts of the sentence and subjecting them to a different test is antithetical to this determination, and may well undermine it.</p>

The public interest test encourages agreement on a specific agreed-upon sentence and offers certainty for the parties by protecting this agreement in order to promote efficient outcomes for the justice system and all participants. There is no such certainty or agreement where the Crown and the defence propose different sentencing ranges.</p>

Joint submissions, which cover off every aspect of the sentence proposed to the court, offer certainty because of agreement in the form of a <i>quid pro quo</i>:<i> </i>the accused agrees to plead guilty in exchange for the Crown agreeing to recommend a specific sentence to the court that both the Crown and the accused find acceptable (<i>Anthony-Cook</i>, at para. 36). Nothing remains to be litigated. By its very nature, the <i>quid pro quo </i>of which I speak does not exist with contested sentencings, regardless of the amount of prior negotiation between the parties culminating in the guilty plea (I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at para. 7). The proposed sentence is neither fixed nor final. Loose ends remain to be litigated. Even in situations where the Crown and the accused may have resolution discussions prior to a contested sentencing hearing, the fact remains that the Crown is not agreeing to recommend a specific sentence to the court upon which the parties agree. </p>

Although both save the justice system and its participants the time, stress, and cost of a trial, a contested sentencing requires the parties to prepare for and provide comprehensive submissions at a sentencing hearing. A joint submission hearing, on the other hand, can be counted on to take a fraction of the time and resources. </p>

Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s sentencing hearing took an entire day. The Crown and the defence properly put their best foot forward, providing lengthy submissions in support of the reasonableness of their positions. Following the hearing, the judge needed two weeks to deliberate and render a written decision. In contrast, joint submission hearings generally consist of the Crown reading in an agreed statement of facts and setting out the joint position. This will usually be completed in short order, with the sentence being imposed on the spot. Rarely is the judge required to render a lengthy decision.&nbsp; </p>

They would no longer offer an unparalleled certainty as to the length of the accused’s sentence, since contested sentencings would offer a similar certainty. Where a joint submission is put forward, it will be the rarest of cases that a judge applying the public interest test deviates from the specific sentence proposed. In a contested sentencing, a judge applying the public interest test would be equally constrained from imposing a sentence that exceeded the upper end of the sentencing range proposed by the Crown. </p>

Accused persons might well choose to gamble by proceeding to a contested sentencing, leaving open the possibility of obtaining a lower sentence than the one that would have formed the basis of a joint submission. If joint submissions were frequently replaced with contested sentencing hearings, this would result in more lengthy and time-consuming sentencing hearings, thereby placing an even greater strain on a justice system that is already overburdened. </p>

Applying the public interest test to contested sentencings would limit judges’ discretion by effectively capping the lengths of sentences at the Crown’s proposed upper range. A judge wishing to exceed the Crown’s upper range would have to consider whether the upper range was so low that reasonable persons would view it as a breakdown in the functioning of the justice system. This stringent test would rarely be met. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par41" class="">41</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, one aspect of the responsibility to craft a fit sentence would gradually shift from sentencing judges to the Crown. The upper ranges for guilty pleas would effectively become a Crown prerogative. Although judicial discretion is limited by the public interest test in the context of a joint submission, this limitation is justified in order to protect the parties’ agreement on a specific sentence — the length of which is not unilaterally decided by the Crown. In contrast, if the public interest test applied to contested sentencings, the upper range would often be unilaterally decided by the Crown. This, in turn, would also have consequences for parties considering case law ranges when agreeing on a joint submission. Joint submissions are rarely published. Parties deciding on a joint submission will generally look to case law ranges established in contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea. Allowing the Crown to be the arbiter of the upper range of sentences following a guilty plea is surely not a role that Parliament intended to confer upon the Crown (<i><span style="line-height:

It is enough for a judge to advise the parties that, in their view, the sentence proposed by the Crown appears too lenient, having regard to the seriousness of the offence and/or the degree of responsibility of the accused. Providing comprehensive reasons for this concern may, and often will, prove impossible since the judge’s position at this point is unlikely to be fixed. As indicated, the purpose is simply to put the parties on notice that the judge is considering exceeding the Crown’s proposed sentence. Notifying the parties can be as simple as saying: I am considering imposing a higher sentence than the Crown is seeking due to the seriousness of this offence (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Scott</i>, 2016 NLCA&nbsp;16, 376 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 167, at para. 37). While notice need not take a particular form, it must be more than simply asking questions or expressing vague concerns about the parties’ sentencing proposals.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par46" class="">46</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There may be cases where the judge has no thought of imposing a harsher sentence than the Crown has proposed until the sentencing hearing is over and the judge has reserved their decision. When that occurs, the judge should notify the parties as soon as possible and invite further submissions, either orally or in writing. At this juncture, the judge may be able to provide greater detail as to the reasons for their concern. </p>

I would not give effect to this submission. Sentencing judges should only allow for the withdrawal of guilty pleas in exceptional circumstances, such as where counsel have made a fundamental error about the availability of the proposed sentence (<i>Anthony-Cook</i>, at para. 59). For example, this would occur where a period of incarceration is mandated by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, but the parties have erroneously proposed non-custodial sentences with differing terms and conditions.<i> </i>As the Attorney General of Ontario noted, it is settled law that an accused cannot withdraw their guilty plea solely because the judge does not agree with the proposed sentence (I.F., at para.&nbsp;19; <i>R. v. Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 372). Allowing a plea to be struck simply because the judge decides to impose a harsher sentence than expected would undermine the finality of guilty pleas and encourage judge shopping (<i>R. v. Wong</i>, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at para. 29). </p>

The opportunity for further submissions should not be relied on as a chance to pull a rabbit out of the hat. Additional submissions should respond to the concerns raised, including matters that the parties considered irrelevant or simply overlooked in their initial submissions. For example, this will be the case where the parties propose differing non-custodial options and the judge signals that they are considering a period of incarceration. Further argument and pertinent authorities will likely be necessary.</p>

Although documents and discussions arising out of plea negotiations are subject to settlement privilege (<i>R. v. Shyback</i>, 2018 ABCA 331, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 197, at para. 28), the parties can agree to waive this privilege where it would assist the judge in determining a fit sentence. The sentence proposed by the Crown will justifiably be more lenient than expected if, for example, the accused provided vital information for another prosecution or was a confidential informant. If there is a concern about revealing confidential information, the parties should discuss an appropriate way to let the judge know, such as a sealed affidavit. Another way may be for the parties to alert the judge as to the negotiation considerations without getting into details. For example, the Crown can be expected to alert the judge in its submissions that it has considered the strength of its case in proposing its sentencing range, particularly where the range would appear to be too lenient. This is commonly done without the Crown going into detail about the deficiencies of its case. In sum, revealing facets of the plea negotiation will sometimes play an important role in enabling the judge to properly assess the fitness of the competing proposed sentences. </p>

Procedural fairness is not the applicable route of appeal. Rather, the applicable route of appeal is the error in principle model, as outlined in <i>R. v. Lacasse</i>, 2015 SCC 64 [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089. The judge’s failure to provide notice and the opportunity for further submissions is an error in principle that will only justify appellate intervention “where it appears from the trial judge’s decision that such an error had an impact on the sentence” (<i>Lacasse</i>, at para. 44; see also <i>R. v. Friesen</i>, 2020 SCC 9, at para. 26). In short, this failure is always an error, though not necessarily one warranting appellate intervention. Where the appellant can establish impact, the judge will have been deprived of an important piece of information relevant to determining a fit sentence. I see no reason to diverge from this established approach to sentence appeals. </p>

It is well established that the requirements for procedural fairness are context-specific (<i>Lyons</i>, at p. 361; <i>Baker v.

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 2007 SCC 9, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350, at para. 57; <i>R. v. Rodgers</i>, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at paras. 47-48). Certain protections required in one context to ensure procedural fairness may not be required in another (<i>Lyons</i>, at p. 361). In other words, “[w]hat is fair in a particular case will depend on the context of the case” (<i>Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General)</i>, 2002 SCC 75,<i> </i>[2002] 4&nbsp;S.C.R. 3, at para.&nbsp;39). </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par54" class="">54</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee alleges that the procedural unfairness in his case is a breach of the rule of <i>audi alteram partem</i>: a person must be given an opportunity to be heard where the outcome will affect them (<i>A.&nbsp;(L.L.) v. B.&nbsp;(A.)</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536, at para.&nbsp;27). In my view, his submission must fail. There is no breach of common law procedural fairness in the context of a sentencing hearing where the accused has been made aware of the Crown’s case and been given a full opportunity to respond to it. That is a very different situation from one where the accused has been denied <i>any</i> meaningful right to be heard at first instance (see, e.g., <i>Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643; <i>Baker</i>; <i>R. v. McDonald</i>, 2018 ONCA 369, 360 C.C.C. (3d) 494). Such cases involve both actual and perceived unfairness to the appellant. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par55" class="">55</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A fair hearing must generally allow the parties to know the opposing party’s case so that they can respond to it and bring evidence in support of their position (<i>Rodgers</i>, at para. 48; see also <i>Ruby</i>, at para. 40). According to this general rule, accused persons like Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee are not denied a fair hearing because they have been made aware of the Crown’s case and have provided detailed submissions at the initial sentencing hearing in support of their position. While the accused will not have been informed about the sentencing judge’s concerns, they will have put their best foot forward as to why the sentence they have proposed is fit and why the Crown’s sentence is excessive. This will often include, where necessary, cross-examining Crown witnesses, calling defence witnesses, filing reports, and/or providing an extensive review of relevant case law. That is a far cry from joint submissions, where the parties are unlikely to have presented their case in such a detailed and comprehensive manner. It follows that, in the context of a joint submission, fairness requires that the parties receive notice and information about the judge’s concerns in order to know how to respond in a more detailed manner (<i>Anthony-Cook</i>, at para. 58). The same concerns are significantly attenuated in the context of a contested sentencing hearing, where it is expected that the parties will have provided detailed and comprehensive submissions.&nbsp; </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par56" class="">56</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee claims that he is entitled to be sentenced afresh because he was deprived of the opportunity to provide information at his sentencing hearing, assuming such information exists, regardless of whether it would have had an impact on his sentence. Respectfully, I disagree. As indicated, I am satisfied that in this context, the applicable route of appeal is the error in principle model, which requires impact. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par57" class="">57</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I say that because, in this context, there is no meaningful loss of procedural fairness since, by its nature, the informational deficiency, if it exists, is one that can be readily remedied on appeal (<i>Baker</i>, at para. 24). The basis of the appeal would be an alleged error in principle. The appellant need only inform the court of the information they were unable to bring to the attention of the sentencing judge. If this information is material, such that it appears to the appellate court that it would have impacted the sentence, the court can sentence afresh (<i>Friesen</i>, at para. 27; <i>Lacasse</i>, at paras. 43-44). </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par58" class="">58</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee suggests that the error in principle model is inappropriate because appellate judges will be unable to assess impact, since they can never know what the parties may have put before the judge, had the parties been offered a further opportunity to do so. As a result, it is impossible for appellate judges to say that the sentence would not have been different (A.F., at para.&nbsp;99; see also <i>R. v. Sidhu</i>, 2022 ABCA 66, 411 C.C.C. (3d) 329, at para. 73; <i>R. v. Mohiadin</i>, 2021 ONCA&nbsp;122, at para.&nbsp;9 (CanLII); <i>Blake-Samuels</i>, at paras. 36 and 38). I would not give effect to this submission. The parties are best placed to inform the appellate court of the information they would have provided, had they been given the opportunity to do so. It is not unduly burdensome to require the appellant — with the aid of the Crown where it has relevant information to share as to why its proposed sentence was appropriate — to provide the appellate court with the information the sentencing judge did not have due to their failure to provide notice. If there is no additional information that the accused would have provided, then the lack of opportunity to provide this information will have had no impact on the sentence. This is simply not a situation where the error’s impact on sentence is unknowable, such that impact must be assumed in all cases. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par59" class="">59</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, where the sentencing judge fails to provide notice and/or an opportunity for further submissions, there are three types of errors in principle that would warrant intervention by the appellate court:</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:77.75pt;text-indent:-77.75pt"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>If the failure to provide notice and/or further submissions impacts the sentence.</i> The appellant must demonstrate that there was information that they could have provided, if given the opportunity to do so, and it appears to the appellate court that this information would have impacted the sentence. If the appellate court is of the view that there is missing information that would realistically have impacted the sentence, the court can consider the sentence afresh. In assessing impact, the focus should be on whether the missing information is material to the sentence at issue. For example, where both parties propose non-custodial sentences and the judge imposes a period of incarceration without notice, the appellant can establish impact by pointing to something material that they would have presented had they been given notice and the opportunity for further submissions, such as a pertinent authority or important mitigating fact. The Crown should assist the appellate court wherever possible by providing or confirming the information that the sentencing judge did not have. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:77.75pt;text-indent:-77.75pt"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>If the sentencing judge failed to provide reasons, or provided unclear or insufficient reasons, for imposing the harsher sentence.</i> Failure to provide sufficient reasons is an error of law, which is a type of error in principle (<i>Friesen</i>, at para.&nbsp;26; <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para.&nbsp;28). The appellate court may only intervene if the insufficiency of reasons foreclosed meaningful appellate review. While it is preferable for sentencing judges to explicitly say why they exceeded the Crown range, it will not necessarily foreclose meaningful appellate review if this is not done. The court may look to the record, as a whole, to determine whether sufficient reasons have been given for exceeding the Crown range. Courts are to take a functional approach to sufficiency of reasons (<i>Sheppard</i>, at para. 50). </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:77.75pt;text-indent:-77.75pt"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>If the sentencing judge provided erroneous reasons for imposing the harsher sentence.</i> The appellate court may intervene if the sentencing judge relied on flawed or unsupportable reasoning for imposing the harsher sentence, such as the erroneous consideration of an aggravating factor or misapprehension of relevant authorities. Standing alone, however, flawed reasoning will not be enough; the appellant must also satisfy the court that this reasoning impacted the sentence (<i>Lacasse</i>, at paras. 43-44).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par60" class="">60</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An appellant may argue one or more of these three grounds of appeal. In cases where it may be difficult for the appellant to demonstrate impact based on the content of the sentencing judge’s reasons, the latter two grounds of appeal — in addition to the Crown’s obligation to assist the appellate court with respect to information not in front of the sentencing judge — act as safeguards to ensure that the appellant can obtain a remedy where appropriate. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par61" class="">61</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If there is an error in principle that impacts the sentence, the appellate court may sentence the appellant afresh without deference, save for the findings made by the sentencing judge (<i>Friesen</i>, at para. 28). Although I need not decide whether appellate courts can remit a case back to the trial court for a fresh sentencing hearing, I would not foreclose the possibility that they could, in rare cases, order a fresh sentencing hearing where the record is so incomplete as to foreclose a fresh assessment at the appellate court. If no error in principle is established, or the error in principle does not have an impact on the sentence, then the only potential remaining ground of appeal will be whether the sentence is demonstrably unfit (<i>Friesen</i>, at para. 26). </p>

At the plea proceeding prior to sentencing, Mr.&nbsp;Nahanee’s trial counsel indicated to the judge that the matter regarding E.N. had been set down for trial but that, “[t]hrough extensive resolution discussions with my friend, including quite a thorough statement of facts and Crown’s sentencing decision which was provided by my friend’s office . . .

I agree with my colleague that the sentencing judge was not required to apply the public interest test from <i>R. v. Anthony-Cook</i>, <span style="line-height:200%">2016 SCC 43, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 204</span>, which is reserved for joint submissions. I further agree that a judge considering a harsher sentence than that proposed by the Crown is required to advise the parties and invite further submissions. What divides us is the question of remedy when a judge fails to follow this procedure.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par72" class="">72</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Lacasse</i>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, and <i>R. v. Friesen</i>, 2020 SCC 9, this Court set out the principles concerning appellate intervention in appeals from the sentence imposed. For good reason, these decisions narrowly defined the role of appellate courts in varying sentencing decisions. However, they were not concerned with procedural fairness, nor did they address the longstanding principle that procedural fairness is an independent basis for reviewing decisions affecting an individual’s rights and interests, and providing a remedy if appropriate. This case requires the Court to address the additional issue of procedural fairness and the related principle that justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par73" class="">73</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">In my view, it is fundamentally unfair for a sentencing judge to impose a sentence upon an accused that is harsher than the one proposed by the Crown without giving the parties notice and an opportunity to respond to the judge’s concerns. An accused is not required to demonstrate that this flawed procedure resulted in a sentence that is demonstrably unfit or that it amounted to an error in principle that had an impact on sentence. Nor is it necessary to demonstrate that there was specific information that would have been provided to the sentencing judge and that it would have impacted the sentence. </span></p>

They must be able to address a point of fact or law that is of concern to the sentencing judge, and which could result in a more severe deprivation of liberty. Where this is not done, there is a breach of the duty of procedural fairness which, in itself, will generally warrant appellate intervention. In such a case, the appellate court should conduct a fresh assessment to determine a fit sentence.</span></p>

Second, I conclude that the duty of procedural fairness is breached where a sentencing judge fails to provide the parties with notice of their intent to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes or an opportunity to make submissions to address the judge’s concerns.

In criminal proceedings, the obligation to hold a fair hearing is due to both the accused and the Crown (<i>S.&nbsp;(R.D.)</i>, at para.&nbsp;96, per Cory J.).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par77" class="">77</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">An essential component of procedural fairness is that parties have the right to be heard. Individuals whose rights, privileges or interests are affected by a decision must be given an opportunity to be heard before the decision is made (<i>A.&nbsp;(L.L.) v. B.&nbsp;(A.)</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536, at para. 27; <i>Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 195). Allowing those affected to put forward their views and evidence fully and have them considered by the decision-maker contributes to a fair, open and impartial process. </span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par78" class="">78</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">The right to be heard is closely tied to the right to notice of the case to meet. The case to meet informs the parties of the issues they need to address and guides their submissions and the evidence they will adduce at the hearing (<i>Harkat</i>, at para.&nbsp;41). </span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par79" class="">79</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">In sentencing proceedings, a high degree of procedural fairness is required.</span> It is well established that the requirements of procedural fairness are context-specific (<i><span style="line-height:200%">R. v. Rodgers</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at para.&nbsp;47; <i>R. v. Zinck</i>, 2003 SCC 6, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 41, at </span>para.&nbsp;36<span style="line-height:200%">). Depending on the nature of the decision being made and the importance of the rights and interests at stake, procedural fairness may need to be more jealously guarded and strictly enforced. Accordingly, especially in proceedings of a penal nature, it is essential that parties be afforded the right to be heard (<i>Supermarchés Jean Labrecque Inc. v. Flamand</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 219, at para.&nbsp;60).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par80" class="">80</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">Procedural fairness is also particularly important in sentencing proceedings due to their adversarial nature. In the adversarial justice system, the positions of the parties and their framing of the issues will guide the evidence led and submissions at a sentencing hearing (<i>R. v. Mian</i>, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 38). While a judge is permitted to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes, the jeopardy faced by the accused is typically tied to the Crown’s recommendation. Accordingly, at a contested sentencing hearing, the accused will be directing argument primarily to the positions taken by the Crown; the points of disagreement between the parties on sentence generally form the basis of their submissions (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Blake-Samuels</i>, 2021 ONCA 77, 69 C.R. (7th) 274, at para.&nbsp;36). The accused may believe a point not disputed by the Crown is not in contention and not make any submissions on that point; a subsequent sentence inconsistent with the point can then take both parties by surprise (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Huon</i>, 2010 BCCA 143, at paras.&nbsp;5-6 (CanLII)).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par81" class="">81</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">As a result, it is critical that the parties have notice of the case to meet and an opportunity to be heard where a judge intends to depart from their submissions on sentencing.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par82" class="">82</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Anthony-Cook</i>, at para.&nbsp;58, the Court stated that where a trial judge is troubled by a joint submission on sentence, “fundamental fairness dictates that an opportunity be afforded to counsel to make further submissions in an attempt to address the&nbsp;<span style="line-height:200%">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. judge’s concerns before the sentence is imposed” (quoting <i>R. v. G.W.C.</i>, 2000 ABCA 333, 277 A.R. 20, at para.&nbsp;26). Although this statement was made in the context of joint submissions, in my view, the underlying principle extends to contested sentencing hearings where a judge is planning to depart from the parties’ submissions and impose a harsher sentence than what the Crown has proposed (see also <i>Blake-Samuels</i>, at para.&nbsp;32).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par83" class="">83</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">The failure to advise counsel or invite further submissions regarding the judge’s intention to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown’s recommendation is a breach of procedural fairness because it denies the parties adequate notice of the case to meet and the right to be heard. The flawed procedure impacts the parties’ ability to make meaningful submissions, which might have addressed the judge’s concerns. There is a heightened risk that the judge will impose a sentence without all of the relevant information that might have been provided. Furthermore, the appearance of fairness in the proceedings is undermined.</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par84" class="">84</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, I do not agree with the assumption that where a judge fails to provide notice or an opportunity for further submissions in the context of a contested sentencing hearing, the parties will have already provided comprehensive submissions and thus fairness concerns are significantly attenuated (Moldaver&nbsp;J.’s reasons, at paras.&nbsp;55 and 64).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par85" class="">85</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">First, given the adversarial nature of sentencing proceedings, it is unrealistic to expect that the parties will initially adduce all potentially relevant information. The submissions of the Crown and the accused will be tailored to each other’s positions, and may not be responsive to the unexpressed concerns of the sentencing judge (see, e.g., <i>Huon</i>, at paras.&nbsp;5-6). In <i>R. v. Scott</i>, 2016 NLCA 16, </span>376 Nfld.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;P.E.I.R. 167, <span style="line-height:
200%">at para.&nbsp;37, Rowe&nbsp;J.A. (as he then was) recognized this point, stating:</span></p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltC">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. certain facts or cases may become relevant if the sentencing judge is considering “jumping” the Crown’s submission on sentence, whereas they would not be relevant if the judge were to impose a sentence no greater than that sought by the Crown. Unless Defence counsel is aware that the judge is considering “jumping” the Crown’s submission on sentence, matters relevant to sentence may not be placed before the judge.</p> 
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">If counsel were expected to adduce<i> all</i> relevant information, in an effort to pre-empt every potential concern of the sentencing judge, this would result in more lengthy and time-consuming sentencing hearings, thereby placing an even greater strain on the justice system. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par86" class="">86</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">Counsel may also choose not to reveal certain information during the sentencing hearing, even though it may be relevant, absent some indication that it bears on an issue of concern to the sentencing judge. For example, there may be a negotiated element to the parties’ positions on sentencing. The reasons and rationale for the negotiations and resulting agreements may not be readily apparent to a sentencing judge, and may not be offered at first instance as they may be sensitive in nature (see, e.g., <i>Scott</i>, at paras.&nbsp;19-22). Resolution discussions are also protected by settlement privilege, subject to exceptions “when the justice of the case requires it” (<i>Sable Offshore Energy Inc. v. Ameron International Corp</i>., 2013 SCC 37, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 623, at para.&nbsp;12, citing <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd. v. Greater London Council</i>, [1988] 3 All E.R. 737 (H.L.), at p.&nbsp;740; <i>R. v. Delchev</i>, 2015 ONCA 381, 126 O.R. (3d) 267, at para.&nbsp;28). Accordingly, as the intervener Attorney General of Ontario put it, “Routinely disclosing plea negotiations during sentencing submissions would erode the privilege attached to those negotiations. It is a practice best avoided” (I.F., at para.&nbsp;16).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par87" class="">87</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">If the parties knew the judge was considering a sentence harsher than the Crown proposes, the Crown could provide useful information to justify the reasons for its position (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Burback</i>, 2012 ABCA 30, 522 A.R. 352, at para.&nbsp;14). Either party may seek to provide further information, evidence or argument to address the judge’s concerns, or provide additional authorities not previously brought to the judge’s attention (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Ehaloak</i>, 2017 NUCA 4, at para.&nbsp;37 (CanLII)). For example, a harsher sentence could trigger a collateral consequence. If there is a negotiated element to the parties’ positions involving a <i>quid pro quo</i> that the parties have, for whatever reason, chosen not to explain, being advised that the judge is considering a harsher sentence provides them the opportunity to put all their cards on the table (R.F., at para.&nbsp;62). For example, the Crown may take the opportunity to explain that the apparent leniency of its recommendation is warranted, based on deficiencies in its case that would have made it difficult to secure a conviction at trial.&nbsp; </span></p>

First, these decisions were not concerned with issues of procedural fairness. The sentencing decisions at issue in each case did not involve any breach of procedural fairness. Further, the discussion of the role of appellate courts in these cases focused on their “dual role” of safeguarding against errors and developing the law and providing guidance (<i>Friesen</i>, at para.&nbsp;34; <i>Lacasse</i>, at paras.&nbsp;36-37). Because procedural fairness was not at issue, this Court did not comment upon the important role that appellate courts also play in maintaining public respect for the administration of justice by ensuring fairness and the perception of fairness within the criminal justice system (see, e.g., <i>S.&nbsp;(R.D.)</i>, at para.&nbsp;91, per Cory&nbsp;J.; <i>R. v. </i><i><span style="line-height:200%">Walker</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, 2019 ONCA 765, 381 C.C.C.

The decisions in <i>Lacasse</i> and <i>Friesen</i> do not detract from this Court’s longstanding recognition that procedural unfairness is an independent basis for reviewing decisions affecting an individual’s rights and interests. In <i><span style="line-height:200%">Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643, at p.&nbsp;661, this Court stated that “[t]he right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent, unqualified right”. Similarly, outside of the administrative law context, this Court in <i>R. v. Tran</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951, at p.&nbsp;981, referred to the “independent responsibility” that courts have “to ensure that their proceedings are fair and in accordance with the principles of natural justice”. </span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par94" class="">94</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, given that it is an independent right, the inquiry into procedural fairness is distinct from the inquiry into whether a sentence is unfit or whether there has been an error in principle that impacted the sentence. If the process was unfair, by definition, the basis upon which the sentence was determined is undermined. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par95" class="">95</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Procedural fairness asks whether the sentence arrived at was the product of a fair procedure. By contrast, the inquiry into the fitness of a sentence focuses on whether it constitutes an “unreasonable departure” from the fundamental principle of proportionality (<i>Lacasse</i>, at paras.&nbsp;52-53).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par96" class="">96</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, an assessment of whether there was an error in principle that impacted sentence is separate from an assessment of procedural fairness. Errors in principle include “an error of law, <span style="line-height:200%">a failure to consider a relevant factor, or erroneous consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor” (<i>Friesen</i>, at para.&nbsp;26). The weighing of factors can constitute an error in principle only if the sentencing judge exercised their discretion unreasonably. Whether or not the parties could exercise their right to be heard — a central concern of procedural fairness — is not addressed by the focus on the sentencing judge’s discretion or their application of the principles of sentencing. A breach of procedural fairness impacts the right to a fair hearing and confidence in the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction in reaching the result, regardless of whether or not the result is consistent with the purposes, principles and objectives of sentencing.</span></p>

I agree with the observation from C.</span>&nbsp;<span style="line-height:200%">C.&nbsp;Ruby, <i>Sentencing</i> (10th ed. 2020), at §3.93, that, “we do not know where on the proper range the sentence would have been fixed if the judge had heard effective submissions”. To give an obvious example, a sentencing judge may reject the Crown’s recommendation as too lenient, without appreciating that the recommendation was justified by deficiencies in the Crown’s case that would have made it difficult to secure a conviction at trial. This information is not something the accused can credibly speak to, to demonstrate how further submissions could have impacted the sentence.</span></p>

In the former role, the court begins its examination of the sentence from a position of deference. By contrast, when it concludes that the sentence was the product of an unfair procedure, the sentencing decision must be set aside, and the appellate court “will apply the principles of sentencing afresh to the facts, without deference to the existing sentence” (<i>Friesen</i>, at para.&nbsp;27).</span></p>

In these circumstances, it is necessary to set the decision aside and conduct the sentencing afresh in order to restore fairness and the appearance of fairness to the proceedings. I agree with the Court of Appeal for Ontario that “[i]t is not appropriate to deny procedural fairness during the sentencing process with the expectation that any error can be cured on appeal” (<i>Blake-Samuels</i>, at para.&nbsp;33). An accused should not have to rely on the appeal process to ensure fairness; rather, “[f]airness should be afforded at all steps” (para.&nbsp;33).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par102" class="">102</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">Thus, it is not necessary for the accused to demonstrate that the breach of procedural fairness caused actual prejudice. As the Court stated in <i>Cardinal</i>, “</span>I find it necessary to affirm that the denial of a right to a fair hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different decision” (p.&nbsp;661). Similarly, the Court has also recognized that the judgment of a partial adjudicator must be set aside, regardless of the merits of their decision: “The damage created by apprehension of bias cannot be remedied. The hearing, and any subsequent order resulting from it, is void” (<i>R. v. Curragh Inc.</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537, at para.&nbsp;6 (emphasis deleted), citing <i>Newfoundland Telephone Co. v. Newfoundland (Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities)</i>, [1992] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 623, at p.&nbsp;645).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par103" class="">103</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">A new determination of a fit sentence will be required, because the procedural deficiency <i>may </i>have worked to the prejudice of one of the parties (<i>Kane v. Board of Governors (University of British Columbia)</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1105, at p.&nbsp;1116). Nonetheless, there are rare circumstances in which a court may exercise its discretion to not grant a remedy for a procedural deficiency where the result is otherwise inevitable (<i>Mobil Oil Canada Ltd.</i></span><i> v. Canada‐Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board</i><span style="line-height:200%">, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p.&nbsp;228</span><span style="line-height:200%">; <i>R. v. Papadopoulos </i>(2005), 196 O.A.C. 335, at para.&nbsp;24; <i>Drapeau v. R.</i>, 2020 QCCA 796).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par104" class="">104</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">In sum, where a sentencing judge fails to advise the parties and invite submissions concerning his or her intention to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes, it is not possible to say whether further submissions would have impacted the sentence. The accused must show that there was a breach of the duty of procedural fairness but need not show actual prejudice. However, in rare cases, the court may choose not to grant a remedy where it is clear that the breach was such that the result was inevitable and public confidence would not be affected.</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par105" class="">105</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">Where a court of appeal determines that there has been a breach of procedural fairness requiring the sentencing decision to be set aside, it must perform its own sentencing analysis without deference to the decision of first instance. In <i>R. v. Sipos</i>, 2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at para.&nbsp;27, this Court recognized that “the predominant view is that there is no authority in the court of appeal to remit the matter to the trial judge for a new sentencing hearing. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If the court of appeal finds that there are grounds requiring its intervention, it imposes a fit sentence in what amounts to a new sentencing hearing” (see also <i>Lowry and Lepper</i>). There is no specific provision in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> empowering the court of appeal to remit the case back to the sentencing judge (Ruby, at §4.52).</span></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par106" class="">106</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">In sentencing afresh, the appellate court may reach a decision that coincides with the penalty imposed at first instance, despite the additional submissions and analysis. However, irrespective of the outcome of sentencing afresh, it is essential that fairness and the appearance of fairness have been restored.</span></p>
