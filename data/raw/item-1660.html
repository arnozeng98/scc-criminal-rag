24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> L’Heureux‑Dubé, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci, Major and Binnie JJ.:&nbsp; Section 347 of the <i>Code</i> applies to the LPP imposed by the respondent.&nbsp; For the purposes of s.&nbsp;347, “interest” is an extremely comprehensive term which expressly includes charges or expenses “in the form of a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. penalty”.&nbsp; However, not every charge or expense will be subject to the criminal interest rate provision.&nbsp; In order to constitute “interest” under s.&nbsp;347, a charge ‑‑ whatever its form ‑‑ must be “paid or payable for the advancing of credit under an agreement or arrangement”.&nbsp; Under s.&nbsp;347(2), “credit advanced” encompasses not only “the money” advanced under an agreement or arrangement, but also “the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits” which may be so advanced.&nbsp; The most plausible interpretation of s.&nbsp;347(2) is that an “advance” of “the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits” means a deferral of payment for such items.&nbsp; The respondent provides goods and services to its customers, for which a specified amount of money is payable each month on a certain date.&nbsp; The deferral of that payment past the due date constitutes “credit advanced” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;347(2), assuming that such deferral is permitted under the payment relationship which exists between the parties.&nbsp; Moreover, the credit is advanced by the respondent to its customers “under an agreement or arrangement”.&nbsp; The arrangement between the parties creates two payment options:&nbsp; a short‑term option, which costs nothing, and a longer‑term option, which involves an additional charge.&nbsp; While it is clear that the respondent neither encourages late payments nor seeks to profit from them, under the terms prevailing between the parties customers are permitted to defer their payment, albeit for a price.&nbsp; That is an arrangement for the advancing of credit under the broad language adopted in s.&nbsp;347.&nbsp; On the facts of this case, a penalty incurred, pursuant to the terms of a standing arrangement between the parties, for the deferral of payment of a specified amount of money owing for goods, services or benefits is an “interest” charge within the meaning of s.&nbsp;347 and is subject to that law’s prohibitions against requiring or receiving interest at a criminal rate. </span></p>

<div class="Section5">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Section 347 creates two separate offences.&nbsp; Section 347(1)(<i>a</i>) makes it illegal to enter into an agreement or arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate, while s.&nbsp;347(1)(<i>b</i>) makes it illegal to receive a payment or partial payment of interest at a criminal rate.&nbsp; Section 347(1)(<i>a</i>) should be narrowly construed.&nbsp; Whether an agreement or arrangement for credit violates the provision is determined as of the time the transaction is entered into.&nbsp; If the agreement or arrangement permits the payment of interest at a criminal rate but does not require it, there is no violation of s.&nbsp;347(1)(<i>a</i>), although s. 347(1)(<i>b</i>) might be engaged.&nbsp; It is clear that there is no violation of s.&nbsp;347(1)(<i>a</i>) in this case.&nbsp; The arrangement between the respondent and its customers does not, on its face, require the payment of interest at a criminal rate.&nbsp; Section 347(1)(<i>b</i>) should be broadly construed.&nbsp; Whether an interest payment violates the provision is determined as of the time the payment is received.&nbsp; For the purposes of s.&nbsp;347(1)(<i>b</i>), the effective annual rate of interest arising from a payment is calculated over the period during which credit is actually outstanding.&nbsp; Pursuant to the decision in <i>Nelson</i>, there is no violation of s.&nbsp;347(1)(<i>b</i>) where a payment of interest at a criminal rate arises from a voluntary act of the debtor, that is, an act wholly within the control of the debtor and not compelled by the lender or by the occurrence of a determining event set out in the agreement.&nbsp; The actuarial evidence submitted in this case shows that if a regular billing customer waits 38 days or longer to pay, the annual interest rate represented by the five percent charge drops below the criminal threshold of 60 percent per annum.&nbsp; It cannot be said, however, that payment of the LPP within 38 days is a “voluntary” act within the meaning of <i>Nelson</i>.&nbsp; While strictly speaking, it is true that customers may delay their payment of the LPP beyond 38 days, there is clearly no invitation to do so, and it would be disingenuous to conclude that customers actually perceive themselves to be at liberty to wait that long.&nbsp; Statistical evidence submitted by the appellant strongly supports the opposite conclusion.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The motions judge erred in awarding costs against the appellant in his personal capacity.&nbsp; The purpose of s.&nbsp;59.4 of the <i>Law Society Act</i> is to protect class representatives from personal exposure to costs in actions where financial support has been granted by the Class Proceedings Fund.&nbsp; Since the appellant has successfully applied for support from the Class Proceedings Fund, he should not be exposed to personal liability for any costs arising in this action, including costs incurred in the context of procedural motions. </span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Bastarache J. (dissenting):&nbsp; While the definition of “interest” includes the notion of “penalty”, the application of s.&nbsp;347 is also predicated upon the existence of an “agreement or arrangement” for the advancement of credit.&nbsp; On the facts of this case, the respondent has not entered into an agreement or arrangement to give credit to the appellant or to any other customers who have paid the LPP.&nbsp; Far from being a consensual extension of credit, the respondent’s LPP represents an effort to prevent or deter customers from unilaterally taking credit.&nbsp; The decisions of the Ontario Energy Board approving the LPP confirm that the penalty is not “paid or payable for the advancing of credit”, but is an incentive for timely payment.&nbsp; Further indicia supporting this view are the fact that the penalty is not compounded, the fact that it is a one‑time payment which does not increase over time, the fact that there is no sanction for the non‑payment of the penalty, and the fact that the penalty triggers contemporaneously with the account becoming overdue.&nbsp; Since s. 347 of the <i>Code</i> is not applicable, the action should be dismissed.&nbsp; A contract for the extension of credit should not be implied in every case where there is late payment pursuant to a sale of goods.&nbsp; This case involves a regulated industry and a rate approval scheme has been established with the specific purpose of protecting consumer interests.&nbsp; To limit the choice of means of the regulator by resorting to the criminal law power is inappropriate and unwarranted.</span></p>

C.T.C. Mortgage Corp.</i> (1984), 16 D.L.R. (4th) 139 (B.C.C.A), aff’d [1986] 1 S.C.R. 749, to argue that even if the LPP is a charge for the advancement of credit, it cannot violate s. 347 because the payment of the penalty and the interest rate arising from it are determined by voluntary acts of the customer, not by any agreement between the parties.</p>

(<i>b</i>) of s. 347(1), even if such an interest rate is not necessarily required on the face of the arrangement between the parties.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">[F]irst, that whether an agreement or arrangement violates s. 347 must be determined at the time the agreement is entered into; second, that whether the lender is in breach of s. 347 cannot turn on the voluntary conduct of the borrower, and third, that there is no violation of s. 347 where the payment of a criminal interest is not required by the agreement or arrangement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Applying these principles, Winkler J. concluded that the LPP could never give rise to an offence under s. 347 because the payment of the penalty at a criminal rate of interest turns on the voluntary conduct of the customer.&nbsp; Winkler J. found that, as in <i>Nelson</i>, no payment of illegal interest is required under the arrangement between Consumers’ Gas and its customers, at the time that arrangement is entered into.&nbsp; If the customer pays on time, no LPP will be levied.&nbsp; Likewise, if the customer misses the due date but then further delays payment of the LPP for a sufficient amount of time (e.g., 38 days), the resulting rate of interest falls below 60 percent.&nbsp; Winkler J. gave no weight to statistical evidence indicating that a consistent percentage of CG’s customers every month do in fact pay an LPP at an illegal interest rate.&nbsp; He held that in any given case, it is always the customer who determines whether or not to incur the LPP and whether to pay it during the window of time when it may be considered a criminal rate.</p>

III, July 21, 1980, at p. 3146; <i>Thomson</i>,<i> supra</i>, at p. 549.&nbsp; However, it is clear from the language of the statute -- e.g., its reference to insurance and overdraft charges, official fees, and property taxes in mortgage transactions -- that s. 347 was designed to have a much wider reach, and in fact the section has most often been applied to commercial transactions which bear no relation to traditional loan-sharking arrangements.&nbsp; Although s. 347 is a criminal provision, the great majority of cases in which it arises are not criminal prosecutions.&nbsp; Rather, like the case at bar, they are civil actions in which a borrower has asserted the common-law doctrine of illegality in an effort to avoid or recover an interest payment, or to render an agreement unenforceable.&nbsp; For this reason, the provision has attracted criticism from some commercial lawyers and academics, and calls have repeatedly been made for its amendment or repeal.&nbsp; See, e.g., J.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The same argument has been advanced by the respondent in this appeal.&nbsp; To distinguish between fixed and time-sensitive charges is inconsistent with the plain language of s. 347, and to the extent the motions judge relied on such a distinction, such reliance was unfounded.&nbsp; As noted, Parliament expressly expanded the meaning of interest under s. 347 to include one-time charges, whether payable at the outset of a transaction (e.g., fees and commissions) or after repayment is due (e.g., fines and penalties).&nbsp; A time factor, while essential to the definition of common-law interest, is not necessary to bring a payment within the ambit of s. 347, and the LPP cannot be excluded on that ground.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Notably, this definition encompasses not only “the money” advanced under an agreement or arrangement, but also “the monetary value of any goods, services or benefits” which may be so advanced.&nbsp; The scope of s. 347 therefore is not confined exclusively to loans of money.&nbsp; The respondent submits, however, that the reach of s. 347 is limited to cases in which at least <u>some</u> money has been advanced.&nbsp; This argument is based on a grammatical analysis of s. 347(2), since “money” is preceded by the definite article “the”, whereas the phrase “goods, services or benefits” is modified by the indefinite article “any”.&nbsp; Both the motions judge and the Court of Appeal rejected that contention as overly formalistic, and I agree.&nbsp; Section 347 applies to arrangements involving the monetary value of goods, services or benefits even in the absence of an outright advance of money.</p>

M. Goode, <i>Consumer Credit Law</i> (1989), at p. 109.&nbsp; The substance of such “credit” is a determined amount of money which is payable over time.&nbsp; Unlike the principal of a loan, however, such credit is not initially paid out to the debtor in the form of money, but arises when a debt is incurred for goods, services or benefits, and that debt is then deferred in full or in part by agreement of the parties.</p>

Such transactions are analogous to loans even though no money actually changes hands.&nbsp; In place of borrowing funds to pay for goods or services which have been provided, the debtor retains possession of his or her own money and the vendor assumes the position of a creditor by virtue of deferring the debt.&nbsp; Ordinarily in such circumstances, a premium is charged on the deferred amount, reflecting the value of the money which is now owed to the creditor but remains in the control of the party who has been permitted to delay payment.&nbsp; Under this interpretation of s. 347, the retailer who provides financing on a sale at an interest rate exceeding 60 percent per year is subject to the same criminal sanctions as the loan shark who lends money directly at such a rate.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">[T]he bill received by the customer states the amount “payable by due date”, the “due date” and the amount “payable after due date”.&nbsp; The bill does not indicate that payment must be made by the due date and I question the ability of Consumers’ to sue as soon as the due date has passed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It is also made clear, however, that Consumers’ Gas prefers to receive payment by the due date, and that customers who, for whatever reason, fail to meet that deadline must pay a price of five percent on top of the amount owing for that month.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The thrust of the definitions of “credit advanced” and “interest” is to cover all possible aspects of any transaction to ensure that the cost of using someone else’s money never exceeds the criminal rate. &nbsp;Thus, they focus on the actual benefit given to the borrower and the real cost of borrowing.&nbsp; The actual benefit is the real amount in the borrower’s hands minus all the penalties, commissions and other costs incurred.&nbsp; The cost of borrowing is also widely defined.&nbsp; Clearly the intention of the legislature was to concentrate on the substance of the transaction, not on its mechanics or form.</p>

(1)(<i>a</i>) prohibits entering into an agreement which, on its face, requires the payment of illegal interest; he found that such a situation was not before him.&nbsp; However, he held that subs. (1)(<i>b</i>) prohibits the actual receipt of an illegal interest payment, and the rate in such situations must be based on the time elapsed since the money was advanced, even if that period differs from the term foreseen in the agreement.&nbsp; The majority, <i>per</i> Seaton J.A., found that such an approach would produce an absurd result in a situation where the period of repayment is within the exclusive control of the debtor.&nbsp; As Seaton J.A. held at pp. 144-45, Parliament cannot have intended that “an innocent mortgagee who has entered into a perfectly lawful agreement should as the result of the voluntary act of the mortgagor in prepaying the mortgage become guilty of an offence under [s. 347(1)(<i>b</i>)]”.&nbsp; The majority recognized that the same might not be true if a mortgage were payable on the demand of the creditor rather than at the debtor’s option.&nbsp; The reasons of the majority were agreed to in substance by this Court.</p>

M. Goode, in his book <i>Consumer Credit Law</i> (1989), states, at p. 108:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt">If a person takes credit without having been granted it — as where he is slow in paying his dentist’s bill or his solicitor’s account — there is no extension of credit within the Consumer Credit Act.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; [I]f a person allows delay in settlement of a debt without binding himself to grant time to the debtor, there is no agreement for credit.&nbsp; This is so whether the delay in the demand for payment arises from inadvertence or inactivity — as where the supplier is simply dilatory in sending out his accounts — or is an intentional indulgence, as where the supplier agrees to allow further time to pay or to accept payment by instalments.&nbsp; Only where this deferment is not just an indulgence but contractual is there an agreement for credit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:24.4pt">77<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of this case, there is no such consensual extension of credit.&nbsp; I believe that Consumers’ Gas has not entered into an agreement or arrangement to give credit to the appellant or to any other customers who have paid the late payment penalty.&nbsp; Indeed, far from being a consensual extension of credit, the respondent’s late payment penalty represents an effort to prevent or deter customers from unilaterally taking credit.&nbsp; It is simply a penalty exacted by the respondent because the appellant has not paid his bills on a timely basis.&nbsp; To illustrate my view, here is a statement from an American case:&nbsp; <i>Coffelt v. Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co.</i>, 451 S.W.2d 881 (Ark. 1970), <i>per</i> Smith J., at p. 884:</p>

<div class="Section46">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-indent:20.85pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The late charge, far from being an exaction of excessive interest for the loan or forbearance of money, is in fact a device by which consumers are automatically classified to avoid discrimination.&nbsp; Its effect is to require delinquent ratepayers to bear, as nearly as can be determined, the exact collection costs that result from their tardiness in paying their bills.&nbsp; The appellant’s argument actually means in substance not that the utility company be prevented from collecting excessive interest but that its customers who pay their bills promptly be penalized by sharing the burden of collecting costs not of their making.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">See also <i>State ex rel. Utilities Commission v. North Carolina Consumers Council, Inc.</i>, 198 S.E.2d 98 (N.C. Ct. App. 1973).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:24.4pt">79<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decisions of the Ontario Energy Board approving the late payment penalty confirm that the penalty is not “paid or payable for the advancing of credit”.&nbsp; Instead, the Ontario Energy Board considers it to be an incentive for timely payment.&nbsp; In fact, the Board specifically rejected the credit option in its decision on the rate application in these terms (E.B.R.O. 302-II, September 4, 1975, at pp. 118-19):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Board does not think that a monetary incentive for prompt payment is wrong in principle.&nbsp; Interest charged on over-due accounts on a daily basis has an appeal on theoretical grounds, but it gives little incentive to pay by a named date, gives little weight to collection costs and seems complicated.&nbsp; If interest is charged on a monthly basis, it is subject to the same criticism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

(3d) 451, at p. 471:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt">I accept the plaintiff’s argument that a deferral of payment constitutes credit.&nbsp; However, I do not agree that just because a customer does not pay on time [this] means that there has been a deferral of payment or that credit has been advanced, particularly where the company has done what it could to encourage the customer to pay on time.&nbsp; A distinction must be drawn between the situation in which a customer fails to pay within a stipulated time, because of inadvertence, choice or because he does not have the money, and the situation in which an agreement is entered into whereby the lender of money or issuer of goods agrees to delay its demand for payment, in exchange for the consideration of an additional charge.&nbsp; In my view, s. 347 is applicable only to the latter situation.&nbsp; The facts before me reveal the former situation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:24.4pt">82<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec347" target="_blank">Section 347<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> cannot be interpreted as a complete code for consumers.&nbsp; The protection of consumers against such penalty clauses cannot be done by way of an undue extension of these terms.&nbsp; Other options, such as to invalidate abusive penalty clauses, are available to protect consumers.&nbsp; I do not believe that a contract for the extension of credit should be implied in every case where there is late payment pursuant to a sale of goods.&nbsp; This implication, in my view, is an interference with the freedom to contract.&nbsp; I would also note that in the present case, we are dealing with a regulated industry and that a rate approval scheme has been established with the specific purpose of protecting consumer interests.&nbsp; To limit the choice of means of the regulator by resorting to the criminal law power is inappropriate and unwarranted.</p>
