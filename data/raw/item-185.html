-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant was accused of attempted murder and tried by judge and jury. The judge instructed the jury on a number of lesser included offences, in addition to the charge on the indictment. After jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the charge of attempted murder, the judge dismissed them and discharged the accused. The foreman of the jury then indicated to the judge that the jury may have found the accused guilty of a lesser included offence. The judge had the jury reassemble in the body of the courtroom, heard submissions, and then found that he was <i>functus</i>. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the doctrine of <i>functus</i> was not properly applied here and was of the opinion that the jury verdict was not complete until all possible verdicts had been dealt with and disposed of. The acquittal was set aside and a new trial ordered on all of the lesser and included offences. At issue here is whether the jury can be reconvened after being discharged (1) to reconsider its verdict or (2) to complete or correct the transmission and recording of a verdict it had arrived at prior to discharge.</span></p>

The court was wholly <i>functus</i> when the question arose as to verdict and the matter had passed beyond any stage where any correction could be made.</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Lamer J.: A jury, even after discharge, can be reconvened to correct an improper or incomplete transmission or registration of a verdict, but it cannot reconsider a verdict or complete its deliberations with a view to handing down additional verdicts on counts or on included offences that it had not finally determined prior to that discharge; nor can anyone go behind the verdict and make inquiries as regards the nature of the deliberations. The effect of adopting the rule, until now applicable to civil matters, is to ensure that those found guilty by the jury do not go free and, more importantly, that those found innocent by the jury are not convicted.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The error here was in not ascertaining with certainty the verdict on the lesser included offences. If that verdict were an acquittal on all or any of the included offences, the accused should not be deprived of that verdict because of error in its transmission or registration but only if error of law was committed in the reaching of that verdict. The ordering of a new trial is a remedy where the determination of guilt or innocence by the trial court is vitiated by an error.</span></p>

I would emphasize, however, that during the course of his charge the trial judge instructed the jury on the offence of attempted murder set out in the indictment, and upon certain included offences on which the accused could be found guilty, depending upon the view the jury took of the evidence. No issue has been raised as to the adequacy of the charge. During the course of their deliberations, the jury returned to the courtroom with a request for further instruction with respect to included offences. The trial judge gave the requested direction and shortly thereafter the jury returned with its verdict of not guilty. The trial judge, having ascertained that the verdict was unanimous, discharged the prisoner, discharged the jury, and adjourned the court until its next sitting day. No question regarding the completeness of the jury's verdict arose until after the prisoner and the jury had been discharged, and at least one member of the jury left the others and entered the public part of the court.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law is well settled that a trial judge, sitting with a jury, must instruct the jury on the principal offence or offences charged in the indictment, as well as any included offences and the verdicts that may be returned upon them. This principle emerges from <i>R. v. George</i>, [1960] S.C.R. 871. The <i>George</i> case did not involve a jury but the majority of the Court held that it was the duty of a trial judge, in disposing of a criminal case, to consider all included offences of which there is evidence, whether raised by counsel or not. It follows that when sitting with a jury it is the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury with respect to included offences. There are several cases which follow and apply this principle: see <i>R. v. Morehouse</i> (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 231 (N.B.C.A.), pp. 239â40, where <i>R. v. George</i>, <i>supra</i>, was referred to, as well as <i>R. v. Longson</i> (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 421 (B.C.C.A.)</span></p>

Where the verdict is one of acquittal, the prisoner is entitled to an immediate discharge unless subject to continued lawful detention by reason of another cause or matterââsee: <i>R. v. Blanchard</i>, [1941] 3 D.L.R. 467 (B.C.C.A.), and <i>R. v. Hess (No. 2)</i> (1949), 94 C.C.C. 57 (B.C.C.A.)

Smith</i> (1893), 25 N.S.R. 138 (N.S.C.A.) The editors of <i>Crankshaw's Criminal Code</i> (8th ed.) cite these cases for the proposition that upon acquittal an accused is entitled to an immediate discharge from custody. Where the verdict is one of guilt, the trial judge should proceed with the appropriate sentencing procedures in order to complete the disposition of the case.</span></p>

The judge has the discretion in such a case to accept a substituted or second verdict for the first one returned. This discretion, however, is one which is to be exercised during the course of the trial, that is, in the presence of the accused and his counsel, and prior to the dissolution of the court by the discharge of the jury. In <i>R. v. Ford</i> (1853), 3 U.C.C.P. 209, the jury returned a verdict and after it had been discharged questions arose concerning the unanimity of the verdict. The court refused to disturb the verdict and Macaulay C.J., with whom the other two judges concurred, said, at p. 217â18:</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 869, in this Court where the <i>Ford</i> case was referred to with approval and discretionary powers of the trial judge were considered, and <i>R. v.

It is clear, in my view, that the power or duty of the trial judge to intervene when a jury verdict is returned and to make inquiries relating to the true nature of the verdict is one to be exercised prior to the discharge of the jury and, applying the words of Macaulay C.J. in <i>Ford</i>, <i>supra</i>, "before it is too late". It will be too late when the jury is discharged and the court created for the trial of the accused has been dissolved.</span></p>

The respondent cited <i>R. v. Carter</i>, [1964] 1 All E.R. 187, 48 Cr. App. R. 122. In that case, the two appellants were indicted on a single count, robbery with an offensive weapon. Though the prosecutor referred to an alternate verdict of robbery with aggravation, it was not left to the jury. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty of the offence charged, whereupon the trial judge discharged the prisoners. The foreman of the jury then raised the question of included offences and gave a verdict of guilty of robbery with aggravation. The trial judge entered a conviction despite the discharge of the prisoners. It was held in the Court of Appeal that the conviction should stand. The jury was entitled to render the verdict on the included offence without any direction by the judge. They had therefore not completed their verdict when the prisoners were discharged and, accordingly, the discharge was a nullity and the conviction could be recorded. </span></p>

He has referred to authoritative cases where judges, even after a discharge of the jury, have recalled jurors for the purpose of rectifying error or for the clarification of recorded verdicts. I am unable, however, to find any authority binding on this court which has ever extended such a power to trial judges in criminal cases and I am of the opinion that no such extension of the judicial control over juries should be allowed in criminal cases. There is sound reason for this difference of approach to civil matters. The civil trial results from a dispute between private parties. The Crown is not involved. The state takes no part in the resolution of the disputeââbeyond creating the forum for its settlementââand the public generally has no interest. The parties come to court and, if a jury has been chosen as a part of the process, each party has a vital interest in securing its verdict in order to bring to an end the expense and the asperities of litigation. It is in pursuance of this objective that trial judges have been accorded the wider discretion which is justifiable, since its purpose and effect is to resolve a private dispute that is not otherwise of interest to the general public. The criminal case is different. Here, the state and the general public have vital interests in the administration of justice. The accused, of course, has a vital interest in the outcome of his case. Accordingly, sound policy requires a strict approach to the criminal process which will serve to recognize and protect both the interests of the state and the public, and the particular interest of the accused.</span></p>

When the jury returned its verdict, the foreman gave a clear anc completely unambiguous verdict of acquittal and it was acknowledged, in accordance with accepted practice, by each member of the jury. The jury had been charged once on included offences and had returned to the courtroom after commencing deliberation for further instruction. It was then in these circumstances a reasonable conclusion on the part of the trial judge that the jury had considered the included offences and that the jury's verdict was intended to be a full acquittal, including the principal and any included offences. Even in these circumstances, it might have been wiser for the trial judge to inquire from the foreman whether they had any verdict or verdicts respecting the included offences, but I cannot say that it was reversible error on his part to do as he did and discharge both the prisoner and the jury. </span></p>

The appellant was accused of attempted murder and was tried by judge and jury. In his charge to the jury, Hrabinsky J., of the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan, informed the jury that "in addition to the charge on the Indictment, ... there are lesser included offences of which you may find the accused guilty or not guilty". He indicated that if the jury found the accused not guilty of attempted murder, they would have to decide whether or not the accused was guilty of, 1. causing bodily harm by discharging a firearm with intent to wound, maim or disfigure; 2. causing bodily harm by discharging a firearm with intent to endanger the life of any other person; 3. unlawfully causing bodily harm, or; 4. assault causing bodily harm.</span></p>

However, I have concluded that because I discharged the jury before the jury spoke up and said, "Oh, oh, wait, we have something else to say", and I tried to be cautious to give the jury lots of time to do this, nothing was said even while I was saying that I will discharge you until October seventeenth and so on. The jury even went so far as to go, most of them, back into the jury room, when the foreman made a motion and said something to me and then indicated that although they had found the accused not guilty of attempted murder they had a lesser offence to deal with. Unfortunately they did not bring this to the attention of the Court when they were asked, "How say you?". Under the circumstances, I am of the opinion that I am functus, that is, without jurisdiction once having discharged the jury and the accused. The Crown may have a remedy, and I emphasize may have a remedy, by way of an appeal which might, if successful, entail a new trial so that justice will be done. But under the circumstances, as I have already stated, I feel that I am functus and disappointing as it may be, it is my opinion that that is the law and if there is any consolation in a situation such as this, I suppose it can be said it is better to err in favour of the accused if one is to err.</span></p>

Since the trial judge had instructed the jury on the lesser and included offences, the majority of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the jury verdict was not complete until it was clear that all of the possible verdicts had been dealt with and disposed of and held that in such a situation the trial judge has an obligation to recall the jurors in order to take their complete verdict.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is generally accepted that a trial judge sitting without a jury is not <i>functus officio</i> until he has finally disposed of the case. Where the accused is acquitted the trial judge will have exhausted his jurisdiction when the accused is discharged and the trial judge cannot then reopen the case. Following a finding of guilt, however, the judge's duties are not spent until after a sentence is imposed. The trial judge can, in exceptional circumstances and before the imposition of the sentence, reopen the case to permit the accused to tender further evidence. This principle, stated over one hundred years ago in <i>R. v. Clouter &amp; Heath</i> (1859), 8 Cox C.C. 237, has recently been reaffirmed in Canada (see for example, <i>R. v. Lessard</i> (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 70 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Hargraves</i> (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 380 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Re Regina and Bertucci</i> (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 83 (Sask. C.A.); and <i>R. v. Mysko</i> (1980), 2 Sask. R. 342 (C.A.)) If the judge, sitting alone, were <i>functus</i> as regards the determination of guilt as of the moment of that determination, he would have no jurisdiction to reopen the case.</span></p>

The jury, as the trier of fact, decides whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. Even though the verdict is unanimous, if it is unclear, the trial judge may refuse to register it and may require that the jury reconsider its verdict. Up until the time it is discharged, the jury may correct an error in its verdict, even if the accused has been discharged (see <i>R. v. Vodden</i> (1853), Dears. 229, 169 E.R. 706; <i>R. v. Carter</i>, [1964] 1 All E.R. 187, 48 Cr. App. R. 122). But once the jury verdict has been recorded and the jury has been discharged, the assessment of guilt is, subject of course to an appeal, final. The judge, by then sitting alone, cannot reopen the case. All that remains, where the accused has been found guilty, is for the judge to sentence the accused. </span></p>

In <i>Fletcher v. Thomas</i>, [1931] 3 D.L.R. 142, the jury had been discharged after their verdict but still remained in the court room. A few jurors approached counsel for the plaintiff and stated that they had misunderstood two of the questions that had been put to them and that the verdict did not reflect their intentions. Logie J. of the Ontario Supreme Court refused to reconvene the jury. He stated, at p. 146:</span></p>

If a higher Court should see fit to order a new trial, that is quite a different matter, and I conceive that such a course would be taken only on the clearest proof of a grave miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

(2d) 729, after the jury had been discharged, Ruttan J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court was asked to consider a motion by the plaintiffs to set aside the jury verdict and to direct a new trial. The sole reason for the motion was that the damage award was "inordinately low". Ruttan J. refused to grant the motion stating that "The jury has been discharged and cannot now be recalled to consider their decision". The error, if there was one, was in the deliberations of the jury and it was held that that cannot be grounds for recalling the jury to reconsider its decision. (See also <i>Ellis v.

If it has become apparent, after the discharge of the jury, that the foreman erred or, as in this case, might have erred in delivering the verdict, and that, as a result, the record may well not reflect the decision arrived at in the jury room, the jury is allowed to correct the error. <i>&nbsp;Wigmore on Evidence</i> (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8 explains at paragraph 2355, that the reason for allowing the jury to correct the recording of the verdict, after the jury has been discharged, is a practical one:</span></p>

C.A.), illustrates this point. In that case, which was an action for damages due to negligence arising from the operation of motor vehicles, one of the tasks of the jury was to apportion liability between the plaintiff and the defendant. The apportionment of the degree of negligence was set forth by the jury as 80% to the plaintiff and 20% to the defendant. The jury was then discharged. While the judge was discussing the question of costs with counsel, a juryman, through a constable in attendance in the courtâroom, brought to the attention of the plaintiff's counsel that there had been an error made in presenting the degrees of the apportionment. The judge, despite being aware of the error, entered judgment in accordance with the original findings. Citing <i>Wigmore</i>, Hope J.A., of the Ontario Court of Appeal, allowed the appeal and corrected the judgment. In his reasons for judgment, concurred in by both Hogg and F. G. MacKay JJ.A., he stated, at p. 445:</span></p>

However, I think the cases are quite clear that where a verdict has been reached by a jury, a unanimous verdict, as in this case, and some clerical error has occurred either in recording that verdict in the juryroom or by the jury in reporting it to Court, then affidavits may be received, in the interest of justice, to disclose what the true verdict of the jury was. </span></p>

H.C.), the jury's finding as to the percentage degree of fault between the plaintiff and the defendant was reversed when it was presented by the foreman to the court. The jury members were discharged, left the jury box, and retired "in a body as far as the outside of the door leading from the court room" where, in conferring amongst themselves, they realized that an error had been made. Having spoken to no one except the constable, and having taken only four minutes from the time of their discharge to the time they returned to the jury box, they were allowed to correct the error that was made in the transmission of the verdict.</span></p>

In such a situation the affidavits of the jurors could not be accepted. In <i>Danis v. Saumure</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 403, the appellant contended that the verdict arrived at by the jury was perverse. The appellant also sought to file affidavits signed by nine members of the jury purporting to show that the findings made by the jury were not the findings intended to be made by them. This Court refused to admit the affidavits and dismissed the appeal. Although he recognized that statements made by jurors are admissible to show that the written answers do not correspond to the actual decision arrived at by the jury, or to indicate that there was an error in the transmission of the verdict, Kerwin C.J., with whom Rand and Abbott JJ. concurred, was of the view that the affidavits that were being submitted addressed the actual deliberations or intentions of the jurors. Since a jury cannot be reconvened either to explain its verdict or to reconsider the substance of its deliberations, the affidavits were not receivable.</span></p>

Since it was "not a case of error arising between the verdict which the jury had agreed upon and that which was actually rendered and formed the basis for the judgment delivered", the statements by the jurors were inadmissible.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should like to make a final observation before disposing of this case. Given that the case law upon which I rely has mainly developed in nonâcriminal matters, I initially thought that the rule governing criminal jury verdicts might preferably be different, and be as follows: in criminal matters, as of the discharge of the jury, the judge and jury would be <i>functus</i> even to correct an error in the transmission of the verdict. The rationale for this rule could be to leave the error, subject to appeal, to inure to the benefit of the accused. I had no difficulty with this approach until I wondered what would happen if the error was the other way, a verdict of guilty being erroneously entered against an accused who had, in fact, been acquitted by the jury. Once <i>functus</i> the court could not vary the registering of the verdict either way. This latter concern of mine is not merely theoretical but has, since I wrote this judgment, been shown to be justified by a recent decision of the Privy Council in <i>Nanan v. The State</i>, [1986] 3 All E.R. 248, a case in which the accused's conviction for murder was left undisturbed notwithstanding the fact that it was the result of the jury foreman's not understanding the meaning of the word "unanimous" when asked by the clerk of the court whether the verdict was unanimous. It is out of concern for the really innocent that I have come to adopt the rule applicable until now to civil matters. Its effect is to ensure that those found guilty by the jury do not go free, which is not a bad result but, more important, that those found innocent or not convicted by the jury not be convicted.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to address the present appeal. I should first say that I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that the trial judge was faced with a situation where the applicable law was very uncertain. Therefore, anything I say as regards what he should have done is with the obvious advantage of hindsight, and the retrospective effect of the law once stated. Given the very clear instructions by the judge regarding the possible subsidiary verdicts, the blanket statement of "not guilty" by the foreman would normally have ended the matter had it not been for the doubt cast on its accuracy by the foreman's remarks, where he said: "when we discussed this we thought we could find the Defendant not guilty of the charge as laid, but guilty of a lesser offence, is that right?" What had until then been rightly considered a complete and clear verdict became uncertain. As of the moment of that statement the trial judge should have inquired further into this comment by the foreman. He should have had all the jury members recalled to the jury box and, with all of them present, he should have addressed the jury with a view to ascertaining the precise nature of the problem. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are various ways of doing this. As an example, he could have first ascertained whether they had, prior to their being discharged, arrived at a verdict and wanted to correct or complete the transmission of the verdict at which they had arrived. If such was the case he could then have instructed the clerk of the court to register that verdict. If, through questioning, he had found out that they had not come to a final verdict prior to their discharge, then the trial judge could not permit them to reopen their deliberations; for once they had recorded a verdict and had been discharged, their jurisdiction to make findings was spent. The problem could then only be dealt with in the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

I do not think that a new trial should be ordered. Hall J.A. appears to be uneasy when ordering a new trial and touches upon the problem when he says that in any event he would have ordered a new trial on the lesser of the included offences. The problem is that we now do not know with certainty what the verdict is on the included offences. If that verdict is actually an acquittal on all or even any of the included offences, the accused should not be deprived thereof because of error in the transmission or registration of the verdict, but only if error of law was committed in the reaching of that verdict. So the ordering of a new trial was not the preferable course to follow. The ordering of a new trial is a remedy where the determination of guilt or innocence by the court of first instance is vitiated by an error. Here the error was in not ascertaining with certainty what the verdict was.</span></p>

But logic is not always practical and occasionally will operate unfairly.</span></p>

When considering all of the circumstances of the case, I think that the ends of justice will best be served by allowing this appeal, quashing the order of the Court of Appeal and leaving the acquittal, as registered, undisturbed.</span></p>

Fortunately, situations such as this will surely be few in future. Indeed, since the events of this case took place, many jurisdictions throughout Canada have, I am told, adopted a procedure long followed by some. The question put to the jury now specifies each and every possible verdict the Court requested the jury to consider and is not general, as was the question in this case.</span></p>
