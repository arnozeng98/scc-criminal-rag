Despite its importance, the right to cross‑examine has never been unlimited and must conform to the basic principle that all evidence must be relevant in order to be admissible.&nbsp; In addition, the probative value of evidence must be weighed against its prejudicial effect.&nbsp;

Generally, a complainant may be cross‑examined for the purpose of eliciting evidence relating to consent and pertaining to credibility when the probative value of that evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice which might flow from it.&nbsp; Cross‑examination for the purpose of showing consent or impugning credibility which relies upon groundless rape myths and fantasized stereotypes is improper and should not be permitted.&nbsp; The trial judge must consider all of the evidence presented at the <i>voir dire</i> to determine if there is a legitimate purpose for the proposed cross‑examination.&nbsp; In each case he must carefully balance the accused's right to a fair trial against the need for reasonable protection of a complainant.&nbsp; If at the conclusion of the <i>voir dire</i> the cross‑examination is permitted then the jury must be advised as to the proper use that can be made of the evidence derived from the cross‑examination.&nbsp; Here, the privacy of the complainant is an interest that merits protection, as does the need for a relationship of confidence between a patient and her psychiatrist, but the cross‑examination on the complainant's medical records, within the guidelines outlined, should have been permitted to ensure a fair trial and to avoid a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; While the trial judge was correct in refusing to permit cross‑examination for the purpose of determining "what kind of person the complainant is", it was the trial judge's duty to ensure that the accused's rights with regard to cross‑examination were protected.&nbsp; It would have been appropriate to permit cross‑examination on the medical records, in particular the notation, to determine if they would throw any light either on a possible motive for the complainant's allegation that she was the victim of sexual assault or with regard to her conduct which might have led the accused to believe that she was consenting to sexual advances.&nbsp; There was thus a proper purpose for permitting cross‑examination on the medical records.&nbsp; The denial of the opportunity to cross‑examine on these records, and the impossibility of ascertaining what might have been the result of the cross‑examination, make it necessary to order a new trial.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; Before cross‑examination can be allowed on a complainant's prior sexual conduct, the trial judge must determine whether the defence has demonstrated a potential relevance to the cross‑examination capable of outweighing the damage and invasion of privacy it might cause to the complainant.&nbsp; To be satisfied that the threshold of relevance is met, the trial judge must ensure that the evidence is tendered for a legitimate purpose, and that it logically supports a defence.&nbsp; Here, the only purpose invoked by the defence for cross‑examining the complainant on her medical records was the very sort of improper purpose for which evidence cannot be adduced.&nbsp; The defence's failure to raise a valid reason for the cross‑examination was fatal.&nbsp; In our criminal trial system, the trial judge does not have a duty to ensure that all legitimate grounds of cross‑examination are explored by counsel.&nbsp; Further, even assuming that a court of appeal confronted by an unexplored avenue of cross‑examination which might have led to a reasonable doubt as to guilt should direct a new trial to avoid a miscarriage of justice, the accused is not entitled to a new trial in this case on the ground of denial of cross‑examination since no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.&nbsp; On the defence theory that the complainant may have fabricated her story to avoid a confrontation with her parents, there was ample evidence before the jury of the difficult relationship between the complainant and her parents and their disapproval of some of her conduct.&nbsp; On the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, there was also a great deal of negative evidence before the jury about the complainant's "attitude and behaviour" on the day in question.</span></p>

(dissenting): In criminal cases, the defence normally has no access to the medical records of a witness.&nbsp; Medical records evidence is generally completely marginal to the central issue of a trial.&nbsp; Given the fundamental importance placed on the confidentiality of medical records in our society, and the high degree of prejudice to the witness caused by delving into these records, they should only be disclosed in the rare cases when there is cogent evidence to suggest (1)&nbsp;that the competence of the witness to testify is in serious doubt or the witness's testimony with respect to the particular issue to be decided is unreliable because of the witness's medical condition; and (2)&nbsp;that without such disclosure,&nbsp; there would be serious prejudice to the accused's right to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; Mere suggestion, speculation or possibility raised on the part of the defence that such records may be relevant cannot be sufficient.&nbsp; Fishing expeditions should not be permitted. In the event that disclosure is required, the cross‑examination on the witness's medical records must be restricted to the purpose for which they were introduced.&nbsp; Even when the records contain information that is relevant to other issues to be decided, cross‑examination on such information should, except in extraordinary cases, nonetheless remain impermissible.&nbsp; Trial judges possess the undoubted discretion to both exclude evidence and limit cross‑examination on matters which, although arguably relevant to the issue, are outweighed by their potential to prejudice the trial of the issue.&nbsp; Particularly in the case of complainants in sexual assault trials, there is a serious risk that such information will be used to draw impermissible inferences and encourage the trier of fact to rely on myths about the credibility of sexual assault victims to the prejudice of both the witness and the trial process.&nbsp; Here, the complainant's medical records should not have been disclosed to the accused and admitted into evidence.&nbsp; There was no evidence that the complainant was incapable of giving reliable testimony in general, let alone reliable testimony as to the particular issue to be decided ‑‑ the issue of consent ‑‑ or that the complainant was in fact suffering from a condition that would affect her capacity to give reliable testimony.&nbsp; However, once the medical records were disclosed, the trial judge was correct in restricting the purposes for which they could be used and in concluding that the privacy of the complainant was an important value which should play a role in determining the scope of the use of the medical records.</span></p>

Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i>, [1965] 1 All E.R. 506 (H.L.), and <i>R. v. Hawke</i> (1975), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 19 (Ont. C.A.), that in order to permit the accused the opportunity of full answer and defence, the medical records of the complainant should be made available to the defence.&nbsp; This was done for the sole purpose of permitting the defence to attempt to establish that the complainant suffered from a medical or psychiatric condition that rendered her testimony unreliable.&nbsp; Despite free use of the information in the records and the testimony of its own psychiatric expert, the defence was unable to succeed in demonstrating that the complainant was, for this reason, an unreliable witness.</span></p>

If victims of sexual assaults feared that their medical records could be deemed relevant to the assault, then they may very well make the decision to forego medical treatment if they intend to report the assault or if charges are already outstanding.&nbsp; Those that did undergo treatment may be reluctant to fully disclose information out of fear that such information might be used against them, either in the trial or, because of the public nature of the trial process, in other areas of their lives.&nbsp; Such a decision may very well prevent a discussion of matters that are vital to both the course of therapy and their ultimate well-being.</span></p>

Morgan</i>, [1976] A.C. 182 (H.L.), and <i>Pappajohn v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120).&nbsp; In the present case, any mistake of perception or interpretation that might have existed was a matter located solely in the mind of the appellant; nothing in the subsequent comments of the complainant could add to, detract from, or have any relevance to presence or absence of that belief at the time.</span></p>

Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 634.</span></p>

I specifically added:&nbsp; "<u>The fishing expeditions which unfortunately did occur in the past should not be permitted.</u>" (Emphasis added.)</span></p>

(at p. 673) states that "quite apart from the submissions of the defence counsel, it is the duty of the trial judge to ensure that the accused's rights with regard to cross-examination, which are so essential to the defence, are protected".&nbsp; This statement seems to me to pose two difficulties.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first difficulty is the implication that, contrary to the rule set out in <i>Seaboyer</i>, the onus will no longer lie solely upon the accused to establish a legitimate purpose for the cross-examination.&nbsp; Instead, where defence counsel fails to demonstrate a legitimate purpose, the onus may now shift to the trial judge to determine independently whether there are any potential grounds for a legitimate cross-examination.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

(at p. 673) says in such circumstances it is "appropriate to <u>permit</u> cross-examination".&nbsp; (Emphasis added.)&nbsp; But it is not a matter of <u>permitting</u>, since counsel has not requested the cross-examination for the legitimate purpose.&nbsp; In a case like this, where counsel has not requested permission to cross-examine on the matters which are legitimate, two options would seem to be open to the judge if he or she is to discharge his or her duty "to ensure that the accused's rights with regard to cross-examination, which are so essential to the defence, are protected".&nbsp; First, the judge could direct counsel to cross-examine on the untouched matter for the proper purpose.&nbsp; (It would seem insufficient to merely suggest such cross-examination, since if counsel declined, that would not ensure that the accused's rights are protected.)&nbsp; Second, the trial judge could himself undertake the omitted cross-examination.&nbsp; Both alternatives are fraught with difficulty.&nbsp; On the first, the trial judge usurps the right of counsel (and impliedly the accused) to conduct the case as they see fit.&nbsp; On the second, the trial judge finds himself drawn into the role of counsel.</span></p>

Wenger</i>, [1942] O.W.N. 185 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Ignat</i> (1965), 53 W.W.R. 248 (Man. C.A.); <i>Majcenic v. Natale</i>, [1968] 1 O.R. 189 (C.A.); and <i>Jones v. National Coal Board</i>, [1957] 2 All E.R. 155 (C.A.).&nbsp; Indeed, trial judges have been criticized and verdicts overturned precisely because judges have entered the arena and subjected the accused to their own cross-examination:&nbsp; <i>Brouillard v.

Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy</i>, [1924] 1 K.B. 256, at p.&nbsp;259.&nbsp; A judge who takes up the role of counsel, whether for the Crown or for the defence, risks giving the appearance of partiality and courts the danger of psychological identification with the successful answers he or she elicits.</span></p>

Yuill</i>, [1945] 1 All E.R. 183 (C.A.), cited with approval in <i>Brouillard, supra</i>, Lord Greene M.R. explained, at p.&nbsp;185 that:&nbsp; "It must always be borne in mind that the judge does not know what is in counsel's brief and has not the same facilities as counsel for an effective examination-in-chief or cross-examination".</span></p>

Accepting for the purposes of this point that a court of appeal is bound to direct a new trial where it appears that counsel has chosen not to canvas a crucial point in cross-examination which might lead to a miscarriage of justice, I do not see this as such a case.&nbsp; It was argued that cross-examination on the notation in question might have led to an admission by the complainant that she fabricated the story of sexual assault to avoid confrontation with her parents.&nbsp; I agree with Southin J.A. in the Court of Appeal that to the extent that the evidence elicited might have had some slight evidentiary value with respect to the defence's theory that she had fabricated the story to avoid confrontation with her parents, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can be said to have occurred.&nbsp; There was ample evidence before the jury of the difficult relationship that existed between the complainant and her parents and their disapproval of some of her conduct.&nbsp; </span></p>

Bulmer</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 782, at p.&nbsp;790.&nbsp; The support may come from the accused or from other sources; on this point I agree with Cory J.'s resolution of the confusion which existed in the earlier cases.&nbsp; But the support must exist.&nbsp; As Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest put it, a "facile mouthing of some easy phrase of excuse" will not suffice:&nbsp; <i>Bratty v. Attorney-General for Northern Ireland</i>, [1963] A.C. 386 (H.L.), at p.&nbsp;417.</span></p>

A. MacKinnon, <i>Toward a Feminist Theory of the State</i> (1989), at p. 175; L. L. Holmstrom and A. W. Burgess, <i>The Victim of Rape:&nbsp; Institutional Reactions</i> (1983); and <i>Gender Equality in the Canadian Justice System, supra,</i> at p. 18.)&nbsp; In <i>Seaboyer, supra</i>, McLachlin J. observed that these myths were now discredited at p. 604:</span></p>

As a general rule the trial of an accused on a charge of sexual assault need not and should not become an occasion for putting the complainant's lifestyle and reputation on trial.&nbsp; The exception to this rule will arise in those relatively rare cases where the complainant may be fraudulent, cruelly mischievous or maliciously mendacious.&nbsp; </span></p>

Jobidon</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714, at p. 730.&nbsp; In my view the section simply sets out the basic requirements which are applicable to all defences.&nbsp; Namely, that a defence should not be put to the jury if a reasonable jury properly instructed would have been unable to acquit on the basis of the evidence tendered in support of that defence.&nbsp; On the other hand, if a reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit on the basis of the evidence tendered with regard to that defence, then it must be put to the jury.&nbsp; It is for the trial judge to decide whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant putting a defence to a jury as this is a question of law alone. (See <i>Parnerkar v. The Queen</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 449, and <i>Pappajohn</i>, <i>supra</i>.)&nbsp; There is thus a two step procedure which must be followed.&nbsp; First, the trial judge must review all the evidence and decide if it is sufficient to warrant putting the defence to the jury.&nbsp; Second, if the evidence meets that threshold, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury, which in turn will weigh it and decide whether it raises a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; See <i>Wigmore on Evidence, supra</i>, at pp. 968-69; and<i> R. v. Faid,</i> [1983] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p.&nbsp;276.&nbsp; I take this to be the meaning of the words "sufficient evidence" as they appear in s.&nbsp;265(4).</span></p>
