With respect to the second offence, the same conclusion applies:&nbsp; the sentencing judge did not fail to consider relevant factors. </span></p>

(dissenting): A just sentence is one which reflects the seriousness of the crime and fits the individual circumstances of the accused.&nbsp; Appellate courts in a number of provinces have responded to the need to accommodate these dual goals and resolve the tension which may arise between them by introducing the concept of “starting‑point” sentences.&nbsp; The starting‑point approach to sentencing involves two steps.&nbsp; The first step consists of determining the appropriate&nbsp; range of sentence for an offence of this type in a typical case.&nbsp; At this stage, the inquiry is objective.&nbsp; The appropriate range is based on the general characteristics of the typical offence and on the assumption that the accused is a person of good character with no criminal record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using that range as a starting point,&nbsp; the second step involves&nbsp; adjusting the sentence upward or downward on the basis of&nbsp; aggravating or mitigating factors.&nbsp; The judge must consider factors personal to the accused and the victim, and the actual consequences of the offence.&nbsp; In short, the sentence must be individualized to the particular crime and the particular accused before the court.&nbsp; This approach thus represents an attempt to marry in one sentencing principle the values of uniformity and individualization.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the starting‑point approach,&nbsp; in all cases the final sentence will be the least that is appropriate in the circumstances.</span></p>

Ct. J. pertaining to sentence in their entirety:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I have reviewed the facts as provided to me by the Crown today and confirmed by Mr. Tatarchuk and as heard by me at the preliminary inquiry with respect to the charges laid by [the first complainant].&nbsp; I find that neither the assault on [the first complainant] nor on [the second complainant] were major sexual assaults as described in Regina v. Sandercock, or even as later refined since that case.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The assault in 1986 against [the first complainant] occurred on a 16-year-old girl who was placed in Mr. McDonnell's home by Social Services to help her resolve problems in her own home.&nbsp; She liked and trusted the McDonnells and had nowhere else to go.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The assault, while reprehensible, was an isolated one, and it was a situation of far more than fondling as the accused attempted penetration.&nbsp; However, in that case, there was no involvement of violence nor of threats.&nbsp; It did not involve oral sex nor anal intercourse, and there was only partial penetration.&nbsp; The event was spontaneous due to Mr. McDonnell's drunkenness on the night in question.&nbsp; It was a traumatic experience for the victim, but she was already 16 years old and was having other problems which may have contributed to her subsequent state of mind.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">She cared for the defendant and she cared for his wife, and thus she didn't report the incident, unfortunately so, or Mr. McDonnell might have subsequently quit drinking, thus avoiding the later repetition of the offence in circumstances of a similar nature.</p>
</div> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>
<div class="Section15">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In sentencing Mr. McDonnell regarding this first charge, I am cognizant of the decision in R. v. R.P.T. [(1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 109 (Alta. C.A.)], but this is not a case where simple rehabilitation will suffice.&nbsp; Mr. McDonnell needs to commit to never drinking again, thus satisfying the concern that he may never re-offend if he does so only when drinking, but there must be some element of denunciation and general deterrence in this matter as well.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Thus, as stated in Regina v. R.P.T. at page 114, the only solution, however imperfect, is to graft a rehabilitative sentence to a denunciatory sentence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In sentencing Terry McDonnell, I take into account his strong family support, the strong community support, his remorse and his desire to quit drinking, but also the trauma suffered by the victim at a time when she was already troubled, and the fact that F.A.C.S. doesn't see counselling as being of any use to prevent re-offending, for Mr. McDonnell might simply re-offend if drunk again.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Lastly, I recognize that the time elapsed since the offence has relevance in relation to the relative effect of this on both the accused and the victim.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I believe that a fit sentence is 12 months in custody followed by two years probation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Regarding the charges of assault against [the second complainant], the victim in this case has been traumatized, but the acts of the accused were very much in the ‘less grave’ category.&nbsp; Mr. McDonnell is a man of otherwise good character and is a strong member of his community.&nbsp; He has always maintained employment and supported his family.&nbsp; An additional lengthy consecutive custodial sentence to the custodial sentence imposed on the first charge would only seek to destroy the accused and his family and is not necessary to deter others from committing such an offence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">I will thus sentence him to six months in gaol concurrent to the first sentence, plus probation for the same period of time.</p>

Sandercock</i> (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 79 (Alta. C.A.), held (at p. 84) that the key to a major sexual assault is the “evident blameworthiness of the offender”, as reflected in the extent to which the offender’s actions demonstrated “contemptuous disregard for the feelings and personal integrity of the victim”.&nbsp; In the present case, the court held that the appellant breached the trust reposed in him as a foster parent and did so in a manner which involved a serious violation of the complainant’s sexual and personal integrity and demonstrated a complete lack of concern for the feelings of the young girl.&nbsp; There was partial penile penetration of the vagina.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The first point we wish to make is that we cannot envision a situation where nonconsensual intercourse <sup>__</sup> vaginal, anal or oral <sup>__</sup> would not fall into the major sexual assault category.&nbsp; These acts, by their very nature, constitute the ultimate violation of a woman's sexual integrity.&nbsp; And where one is dealing with assaults falling into the major category because of their very nature <sup>__</sup> and here we include rape, attempted rape, fellatio, cunnilingus, and buggery <sup>__</sup> the violence, force and intensity of the act are a given:&nbsp; <i>R. v. McCraw</i>....&nbsp; In addition, in each case, there also exists a very real likelihood of psychological harm.&nbsp; Therefore, what must be understood is that it is not necessary that the Crown prove the existence of this kind of harm as a condition precedent to the courts classifying a sexual assault as a major one.&nbsp; Psychological harm is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; That is what this court said in <i>Sandercock</i>.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">The court elaborated (at pp. 174-75):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">To put the matter another way, the offender is being sentenced on the basis of a major sexual assault, not because any specific psychological consequences have flowed from the attack but rather because of the nature of the attack and the fact that it poses the very real <u>likelihood</u> of long-term emotional or psychological harm.&nbsp; The fact that no such harm may materialize, a fact one could not possibly know until the victim's life had been lived in its entirety, is not a mitigating factor.&nbsp; However, that said, this does not mean that the consequences of the sexual assault are irrelevant.&nbsp; The degree of seriousness of the actions may be measured against the likely long-term consequences of the prohibited act.&nbsp; In other words, where the psychological harm has been severe, that may well be an aggravating factor.&nbsp; Of course, where harm beyond that which would be normally presumed is claimed in a case, the Crown must lead evidence to substantiate it.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">For these reasons, therefore, to bring into question what is presumed to be the psychological harm flowing from a major sexual assault, it is not enough that the defence simply denies that it exists.&nbsp; Bringing the presumed harm into question in this context means pointing to cogent evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; No such evidence existed in this case.

With respect, I find that it does not.&nbsp; An appellate court should not be given free reign to modify a sentencing order simply because it feels that a different order ought to have been made.&nbsp; The formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective process; the trial judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the witnesses whereas the appellate court can only base itself upon a written record.&nbsp; A variation in the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is not fit.&nbsp; That is to say, that it has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable.</p>

It is the exercise of judgment taking into consideration relevant legal principles, the circumstances of the offence and the offender.&nbsp; The most that can be expected of a sentencing judge is to arrive at a sentence that is within an acceptable range.&nbsp; In my opinion, that is the true basis upon which Courts of Appeal review sentences when the only issue is whether the sentence is inadequate or excessive.&nbsp;</p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Unreasonableness in the sentencing process involves the sentencing order falling outside the "acceptable range" of orders; this clearly does not arise in the present appeal.&nbsp; An error of law involves a situation such as that found in<i> R. v. Chaisson</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1118, in which a sentencing judge, while calculating the total time period of incarceration for the purposes of a "half‑time" parole ineligibility order under s. 741.2 of the <i>Code</i>, erroneously included two offences in the calculations notwithstanding the fact that these specific offences were not listed in the schedule of offences to which the s. 741.2 orders apply.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">This deferential standard of review has profound functional justifications.&nbsp; As Iacobucci J. explained in <i>Shropshire</i>, at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime.&nbsp; But in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both <i>Shropshire</i> and this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling.&nbsp; A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender.&nbsp; A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the offender's crime.&nbsp; As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be "just and appropriate" for the protection of that community.&nbsp; The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.&nbsp; The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Appellate courts, of course, serve an important function in reviewing and minimizing the disparity of sentences imposed by sentencing judges for similar offenders and similar offences committed throughout Canada....&nbsp; But in exercising this role, courts of appeal must still exercise a margin of deference before intervening in the specialized discretion that Parliament has explicitly vested in sentencing judges.&nbsp; It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime.... Sentencing is an inherently individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of academic abstraction.&nbsp; As well, sentences for a particular offence should be expected to vary to some degree across various communities and regions in this country, as the "just and appropriate" mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurred.&nbsp; For these reasons, consistent with the general standard of review we articulated in <i>Shropshire</i>, I believe that a court of appeal should only intervene to minimize the disparity of sentences where the sentence imposed by the trial judge is in substantial and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing similar crimes.

12.2pt">One salient fact cannot be overlooked.&nbsp; This was not, despite the defence suggestion, a case of “fondling”.&nbsp; It was a case of penile penetration of the vagina.&nbsp; The fact that McDonnell only succeeded in partially penetrating the complainant’s vagina with his penis because of the complainant’s efforts to resist him does not make this any less a major sexual assault.&nbsp; Partial penetration will suffice.&nbsp; Accordingly, this assault falls squarely within what is described in <i>Sandercock</i> as one of the archetypical cases of major sexual assault.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Second, the court did not accept the submission of the defence, which the court stated (at p. 173) the “trial judge appears to have implicitly accepted”, that the first offence could not constitute major sexual assault because of the absence of psychological harm.&nbsp; The court held that non-consensual intercourse leads to a very high likelihood of trauma, which likelihood is one of the indicia of a major sexual assault according to <i>Sandercock</i>.&nbsp; In any event, the court concluded based on <i>viva voce</i> evidence and the victim impact statement that the complainant in the first case did suffer psychological harm.&nbsp; On the basis of these factors, the court concluded that the first offence was a major sexual assault and that the sentence ordered by the sentencing judge was insufficient.</p>

S.G.O.R.</i> (1991), 113 A.R. 36 (C.A.), aside from other sexual offences involved in the case, the accused raped his daughter over 20 times from when she was four years old until she was 12.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. S.&nbsp;(W.B.); R. v. P. (M.)</i> (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 530 (Alta. C.A.), the accused S. engaged repeatedly in anal intercourse with his six-year-old stepdaughter and his stepson, who was initially in grade three, over a period of two years.&nbsp; The accused P. committed both anal and vaginal rape of a seven-year-old child, physically beating her head and body.&nbsp; <i>R. v. Spence</i> (1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 451 (Alta. C.A.), involved an accused raping his 15-year-old cousin and physically beating and threatening her.&nbsp; <i>R. v. Nicholson</i> (1993), 145 A.R. 262 (C.A.), involved 20 to 30 acts of intercourse starting when the complainant was 12 years old; associated with this abuse, the accused, amongst other things, discharged a rifle in the direction of the complainant as she attempted to escape his residence.&nbsp; Other cases cited by McLachlin J. involved children much younger than the complainants in the present case, such as <i>R. v. Lapatak</i> (1995), 169 A.R. 385 (C.A.), which involved a three-year-old victim.&nbsp;</p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">We have concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this was not a major sexual assault.&nbsp; This court made it clear in <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The court then treated the error as one which justified alteration of the sentence, which implicitly treated the failure to find the major sexual assault as an error in principle.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal concluded that the sentencing judge wrongly declined to find a major sexual assault in part on the basis of what the court viewed as a misapprehension of the requirements for a major sexual assault.&nbsp; The court stated that the sentencing judge appeared to accept the argument of the defence that there was no significant psychological harm in the first case, and therefore there was no major sexual assault.&nbsp; The court stated (at p. 173) that while actual psychological harm may generally be presumed from non-consensual intercourse, it is not the actual harm, but the high likelihood of harm from the nature of the assault that gives rise to a major sexual assault.&nbsp;</p>

(C.A.)</i>, two recent and unanimous decisions of this Court, clearly indicate that deference should be shown to a lower court’s sentencing decision.&nbsp; If&nbsp; an appellate court could simply create reviewable principles by creating categories of offences, deference is diminished in a manner that is inconsistent with <i>Shropshire</i> and <i>M.&nbsp;(C.A.).</i> In order to circumvent deference and to enable appellate review of a particular sentence, a court may simply create a category of offence and a “starting point” for that offence, and treat as an error in principle any deviation in sentencing from the category so created.&nbsp; Indeed, that is what the Court of Appeal in Alberta has done in the present case. &nbsp;If the categories are defined narrowly, and deviations from the categorization are generally reversed, the discretion that should be left in the hands of the trial and sentencing judges is shifted considerably to the appellate courts.&nbsp;</p>

Fedoruk</i>, [1950] S.C.R. 517, it is not for judges to create criminal offences, but rather for the legislature to enact such offences.&nbsp; By creating a species of sexual assault known as a “major sexual assault”, and by basing sentencing decisions on such a categorization, the Alberta Court of Appeal has effectively created an offence, at least for the purposes of sentencing, contrary to the spirit if not the letter of <i>Frey</i>.&nbsp;</p>

McCraw</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, established that psychological harm from a sexual assault may be considered bodily harm.&nbsp; Given Parliament’s intention to treat sexual assaults causing bodily harm under s. 272(<i>c</i>), it is particularly inappropriate to create a “major sexual assault”, which is based at least in part on the existence of harm to the complainant pursuant to s. 271.&nbsp; While the Court of Appeal at times appeared to rely simply on the likelihood of harm in the present case, in <i>Sandercock</i> itself, actual harm was contemplated.&nbsp; <i>Sandercock</i> stated at p. 85, “[t]he other aspect which creates a major sexual assault is the effect on the victim.”&nbsp; In my view, if the prosecution is to be based on the harm to the victim, the accused should be charged under the appropriate section, s. 272(<i>c</i>).&nbsp; It is not for the courts to establish a subset of offence within s. 271 that is based on harm.&nbsp;</p>

Gardiner</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, held that each aggravating factor in a sentencing hearing must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Such an approach is confirmed by Parliament in the new <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec724subsec3" target="_blank">s. 724(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>e</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> (as amended by S.C. 1995, c. 22, s. 6).&nbsp; If psychological harm may be presumed, the burden of proving harm as an aggravating factor is improperly lifted from the Crown and shifted to the accused to disprove harm.</p>

One error alleged by the Court of Appeal was that the trial judge improperly relied on <i>R. v. R.P.T.</i> (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 109 (Alta. C.A.).&nbsp; The court stated that, notwithstanding that the principles it set out were revisited in <i>R. v. S.&nbsp;(W.B.); R. v. P.&nbsp;(M.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; <i>R.P.T.</i> was factually inapplicable because in the present case there was no family that might be restored.&nbsp; In my view, the court erred in finding that the trial judge relied on <i>R.P.T.</i> with respect to the restoration of the family.&nbsp; <i>R.P.T.</i> held at p. 114 that even where there is a family to restore, if the sexual assault by a person <i>in loco parentis</i> on a family member were serious, “[t]he only solution, however imperfect ... must be to graft a rehabilitative sentence to a denunciatory sentence”.&nbsp; If the assault were less serious and if there were a family to restore, a lesser sentence may be imposed; indeed, if the circumstances were “less significant” (p. 115), a suspended sentence may be appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This statement, combined with her emphasis on starting points in her analysis of demonstrable unfitness in the present case, suggests to me that McLachlin J. in effect treats the failure to characterize an assault properly as an error permitting appellate intervention on sentencing.&nbsp; That is, the failure to characterize the assault properly is not an error in principle, but if the sentence reached as a result of that error is not very similar or identical to the sentence that would have been reached had the mischaracterization not occurred, appellate courts may intervene.&nbsp; In my view, this effectively states that while appellate courts must permit sentencing judges to err in characterizing the offence, appellate courts may intervene, notwithstanding deference, if the trial judge’s mischaracterization affected significantly the sentence ordered.&nbsp; Given that different views of the nature of the assault would almost inevitably lead to different sentences, in my view, mischaracterization is treated by McLachlin J. as an error which will often lead to appellate intervention.&nbsp; In my view, as stated, mischaracterization of the offence according to judicially created categories is not an error in principle, nor should it be treated as one.&nbsp; In my respectful opinion, McLachlin J. takes an overly permissive approach to appellate intervention that is inconsistent with both <i>Shropshire</i> and <i>M.

(C.A.)</i> to interfere with the sentence, a sentence cannot be altered on appeal, notwithstanding deviation from a starting point.&nbsp; Deviation from a starting point may be a factor in considering demonstrable unfitness, but does not have the significance McLachlin J. gives it.</p>

Hessam</i> (1983), 43 A.R. 247 (C.A.), <i>R. v. Sandercock</i> (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 79 (Alta. C.A.)<b>.</b>&nbsp; This approach is distinguished from the tariff approach to sentencing which takes no account of the individual circumstances of the offender:&nbsp; C. C. Ruby, <i>Sentencing</i> (4th ed. 1994), at p. 479.&nbsp; The tariff approach looks only at the nature of the offence.&nbsp; In contrast, the starting-point approach mandates consideration of specific aggravating and mitigating factors directly relevant to the individual accused. In this way, the starting-point approach combines general considerations relating to the crime committed with personalized considerations relating to the particular offender and the unique circumstances of the assault.</p>

Baldhead</i>, [1966] 4 C.C.C. 183 (Sask. C.A.), it was held that a sentence could be reviewed if it represented “a marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed in the same jurisdiction for the same or similar crimes” (p. 187).</p>

Marshall, “Sexual Assault, The Charter and Sentencing Reform” (1988), 63 C.R. (3d) 216.&nbsp; Depending on where a particular judge placed a particular type of sexual assault on the spectrum of severity and the seriousness with which he or she regarded that assault, a sentence might be high or low or anywhere in between.&nbsp; The disparities between sentences threatened to go beyond the legitimate area of divergence represented by the individual circumstances of a particular offender and offence, to a more generalized divergence based on judicial views of the seriousness of the offence.&nbsp; This called for judicial action.&nbsp; As the Manitoba Court of Appeal put it in <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The court’s statement is unimpeachable until the last two sentences.&nbsp; As the court notes, the Crown need not prove actual psychological harm in order for the judge to conclude that the assault falls within the category of major sexual assault.&nbsp; The inquiry at this stage is general, concerned not with the actual facts of the case but with the sort of harm this type of assault would <u>be likely to</u> cause.&nbsp; Actual harm or its absence is of no relevance at the first stage of determining a starting point.&nbsp; It is in this sense that I understand the court to be saying that at this stage psychological harm is “presumed”.&nbsp; This said, the language of presumption and in particular the additional phrase “in the absence of evidence to the contrary” are confusing and better avoided.&nbsp; In the end, however, the court made it clear that it was reaffirming <i>Sandercock</i> with its two-part test in which actual harm in the case on trial is never presumed.</p>

When determining whether the sexual assault was “major”, she should have looked only to the nature of the offence having regard to the violence or degradation perpetrated, the nature of the act and the likely effect such an act would typically have on its victim.&nbsp; She should not have considered mitigating factors peculiar to the particular offender and victim in the case before her. In particular, the fact that the accused had been drinking and that the victim had pre-existing problems contributing to her trauma were not relevant factors to consider when determining whether the assault was major.&nbsp; Consideration of these factors led her to conclude that the assault was not major and had the effect of imposing a sentence far below the three-year period of incarceration appropriate for a major sexual assault.&nbsp; The result was a sentence which failed to take proper account of the need for a measure of uniformity and equity between sentences for the same or similar offences.</p>

(C.A.)</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; If the trial judge fails to refer to the appropriate starting point or range but in the end imposes a sentence within the acceptable range of sentence for the offence as adjusted for the particular circumstances of the offender, a court of appeal should not interfere.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the sentence falls outside the appropriate range, the court of appeal must interfere:&nbsp; <i>Shropshire</i>,<i> supra</i>.</p>

(C.A.)</i>,<i> supra</i>, at paras. 90 and 92).&nbsp; The assaults at issue in the case at bar shared the following characteristics:&nbsp; (a) they involved young victims; (b) the accused held a position of trust in relation to the victims; and (c) the first assault involved fondling and attempted rape and the second involved fondling.&nbsp; A review of many cases from Alberta reveals that a sentence of&nbsp; less than two years in circumstances similar to the case at bar constitutes a marked departure from the norm.&nbsp; See: <i>&nbsp;Sandercock</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R. v. S.G.O.R.</i> (1991), 113 A.R. 36 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Sand</i> (1991), 120 A.R. 397 (C.A.); <i>R. v. S. (W.B.); R. v. P. (M.)</i> (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 530 (C.A.);&nbsp; <i>R. v. R.S.B.</i> (1992), 135 A.R. 23 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Spence; R. v. F. (D.L.)</i> (1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 451 (C.A.); <i>R. v. R.E.C.</i>, [1993] A.J. No. 303 (C.A.); <i>R. v.

Lakotos</i> (1996), 187 A.R. 45 (C.A.).&nbsp; The case of <i>R. v. A.B.C.</i> (1991), 120 A.R. 106 (C.A.), where a sentence was imposed of one year in jail and one-year probation, while superficially similar, is distinguishable on a number of grounds, including the fact that the offender and the victim sought counselling together after the assault, expert evidence suggested no risk of re-offending, and the occurrence was a “one-time” isolated event.</p>

This in turn, depreciated the seriousness of the offence and led to a demonstrably unfit sentence.&nbsp; The trial judge held that there was no violence or threats, but failed to consider whether sex obtained from a sleeping minor to whom one stood in a relationship of trust was equivalent to threats.&nbsp; Most significantly, she did not ask herself whether this was the sort of offence which would likely result in lasting psychological or emotional harm, the hallmark of a major sexual assault.&nbsp; She placed great emphasis on the physical acts, for example that the penetration on the first assault was not complete, but none on the violation of the victim’s integrity and sense of self-worth and control over her body and the likely effect that this sort of criminal act would have on her emotional state.&nbsp; This amounted to an overemphasis on some factors and underemphasis on other factors.&nbsp; It also led to a demonstrably unfit sentence.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to intervene:&nbsp; <i>M.
