The Court of Appeal quashed the accused’s conviction as unreasonable and entered an acquittal.&nbsp; The court found that the trial judge should not have relied solely on her own comparison between the appearance of the person on the videotape and the appearance of the accused in court to reach a conclusion that had no other foundation in the evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Once it is established that a videotape has not been altered or changed, and that it depicts the scene of a crime, it becomes admissible and relevant evidence.&nbsp; Not only is the tape real evidence, but it is also, to a certain extent, testimonial evidence as well.&nbsp; It should be used by a trier of fact in determining whether a crime has been committed and whether the accused before the court committed the crime.&nbsp; The degree of clarity and quality of the tape, and to a lesser extent the length of time during which the accused appears on the videotape, will all contribute to establishing the weight which a trier of fact may properly place upon the evidence.&nbsp; The time of depiction may not be significant for even if there are but a few frames which clearly show the perpetrator that may be sufficient to identify the accused.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Although triers of fact are entitled to reach a conclusion as to identification based solely on videotape evidence, they must exercise care in doing so.&nbsp; When a jury is asked to identify an accused in this manner, clear directions must be given to them as to how they are to approach this task.&nbsp; They should be instructed to consider carefully whether the video is of sufficient clarity and quality and shows the accused for a sufficient time to enable them to conclude that identification has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; If it is the only evidence adduced as to identity, the jury should be reminded of this.&nbsp; Further, they should be told, once again, of the important requirement that, in order to convict on the basis of the videotape alone, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it identifies the accused.&nbsp; A trial judge sitting alone must be subject to the same cautions and directions as a jury in considering videotape evidence of identification.</span></p>

The fact that the store clerk could not identify the accused is not of great significance.&nbsp; The violent and menacing jab made by the robber with a large knife directed towards the clerk suggests that self‑preservation, not identification, may very reasonably have been the clerk’s prime concern at the time of the robbery.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; While&nbsp; the sensory observations of a trial judge, based on a review of a videotape and the appearance of the accused, are admissible evidence of "identity" to support a guilty verdict, the evidence in this case makes it clear that the verdict rendered at trial was "unreasonable" within the meaning of s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(I) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The accused was convicted on the basis of very weak identification evidence, which was undermined by the evidence of the Crown's only eyewitness.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:26.4pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:26.4pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Pleich</i> (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 13, at p.&nbsp;32, the Court of Appeal for Ontario recognized that tape recordings are real evidence that had, as well, many of the characteristics of testimonial evidence.&nbsp; In <i>R. v.

(3d) 1, the use of audio tapes was considered by the same court.&nbsp; It found that it was the tapes themselves that constituted the evidence which should be considered by the jury.&nbsp; It emphasized that the tapes could provide cogent and convincing evidence of culpability or equally powerful and convincing evidence of innocence.&nbsp; It stressed that the members of the jury must have equipment available to them so that they could themselves listen to the tapes and reach their decision as to the weight that should be given to them.&nbsp; It was expressed in this way (at pp.&nbsp;47‑48 and 49):</p>

As a result of <i>Rowbotham</i>, the trier of fact in Ontario was very properly authorized to use his or her own senses in determining the weight that should be accorded to the evidence of an audio tape.&nbsp; There is no reason why this same reasoning should not be applied to videotapes.</p>

Leaney</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393, the main identification evidence against the accused was a videotape of the crime in progress and the testimony of five police officers. &nbsp;Although this Court held that the evidence of four of the police officers ought to have been excluded, it upheld the conviction of Leaney on the basis of <u>the trial judge’s own observations of the videotape and his comparison of the tape to the accused in the box</u>.&nbsp; At page&nbsp;415, McLachlin J., for the majority, stated:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">Unlike the trial judge's decision in <i>Leaney</i>, the trial judge in this case made no reference to specific characteristics of the man on the videotape that conformed to the appearance of the accused.&nbsp; Generally, testimony by a person not acquainted with the accused that the accused is the culprit without any description of identifying features of appearance such as colouring of the skin or hair, complexion, facial features, height, weight, age and clothing is little more than an expression of opinion and is generally accorded little weight.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Spatola</i>, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 241 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 249.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial judge in this case lacked the assurance of confirmatory evidence (such as the cap and fingerprints in <i>Leaney</i>) that would have supported her observations of the video and the accused.&nbsp; </span></p>

line-height:24.4pt">58<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, this conviction was based on evidence that amounted to no more than the untested opinion of the trial judge which was contradicted by other evidence that the trial judge did not reject.&nbsp; This included evidence that the victim, a few days after the robbery, identified a person other than the accused as the more likely perpetrator of the crime.&nbsp; The trial judge simply relied on her own observations, the accuracy of which we are not in a position to assess.&nbsp; Having regard for the inherent frailties in identification evidence, I conclude that the conviction rests on a shaky foundation and is unsafe and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; I am satisfied that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.</p>
