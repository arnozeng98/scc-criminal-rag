To be confirmatory, evidence should give comfort that the witness can be trusted.&nbsp; The attribute of independence defines the kind of evidence that can provide comfort that the witness is telling the truth.&nbsp; Evidence that is tainted by connection to the witness cannot serve to confirm his or her testimony.&nbsp; Materiality is a more difficult concept. Evidence does not have to implicate the accused, but in the context of the case as a whole, it should give comfort that the witness was truthful in relevant aspects of his or her account.&nbsp; [11] [32] [39‑40] [42‑43]</span></p>

A <i>Vetrovec</i> warning should draw the jury’s attention to testimonial evidence requiring special scrutiny, explain why this evidence is subject to special scrutiny and it should caution the jury that it is dangerous to convict on unconfirmed evidence of this sort, though the jury is entitled to do so if satisfied that the evidence is true.&nbsp; The fourth element, however, will have detrimental effects on the law and is both unnecessary and unworkable.&nbsp; It is the content of <i>Vetrovec</i> warnings that matters, not their form and this Court should preserve the functional approach set out in <i>Vetrovec</i>.&nbsp; [68] [73]</span></p>

200%"><span lang="EN-GB">Under the fourth element of the framework, the requirement that jurors be told to look for “material” and “independent” corroboration of an unsavoury witness’s testimony detracts jurors from their proper task of weighing the witness’s credibility in a rational and flexible manner. A trier of fact is entitled to believe the evidence of a disreputable witness, even on disputed facts that are not otherwise confirmed, if the trier is satisfied that the witness is truthful.&nbsp; Trial judges should refrain from requiring the intractable concepts of independence and materiality for corroborating evidence. Instead, jurors should be told to focus on credibility. Evidence cannot be categorized as either independent or not independent because evidence lies on a continuum between these two poles. Even proponents of an independence requirement are at a loss to explain what kind of evidence it calls for.&nbsp; Applied mechanically, such a requirement has led to disastrous outcomes. Nor is materiality any easier to pin down.&nbsp; The once strict, ill‑defined requirement of materiality has been weakened.&nbsp; Circumstantial evidence can be confirmatory even if it does not directly implicate the accused and evidence need not bear on a disputed part of a witness’s testimony to be corroborative.&nbsp; [67] [76] [78] [81‑86]</span></p>

Judges are alert to the concern that unsavoury witnesses are prone to favour personal advantage over public duty.&nbsp; And we know from recent experience that unsavoury witnesses, especially but not only “jailhouse informants”, can be convincing liars and can effectively conceal their true motives for testifying as they have: see <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">The judge should first in an objective way determine whether there is a reason to suspect the credibility of the witness according to the traditional means by which such determinations are made. This would include a review of the evidence to determine whether there are factors which have properly led the courts to be wary of accepting a witness’s evidence. Factors might include involvement in criminal activities, a motive to lie by reason of connection to the crime or to the authorities, unexplained delay in coming forward with the story, providing different accounts on other occasions, lies told under oath, and similar considerations. It is not then whether the trial judge personally finds the witness trustworthy but whether there are factors which experience teaches that the witness’s story be approached with caution. Second, the trial judge must assess the importance of the witness to the Crown’s case. If the witness plays a relatively minor role in the proof of guilt it is probably unnecessary to burden the jury with a special caution and then review the confirmatory evidence. However, the more important the witness the greater the duty on the judge to give the caution. At some point, as where the witness plays a central role in the proof of guilt, the warning is mandatory. This, in my view, flows from the duty imposed on the trial judge in criminal cases to review the evidence and relate the evidence to the issues.</p>

Lord Reading C.J. held in <i>Baskerville </i>that the “accomplice corroboration rule” had become a rule of law. This rule was formally adopted by this Court in <i>Horsburgh v.

The result was, in effect, that in due course ‘corroboration’ became virtually divorced from the issue of the credibility of the accomplice. Evidence which strengthened credibility was at the same time characterized as not corroborative ‘in law’.

Items 3), 4), and 7) were not corroborative because their relevance depended on the testimony of the complainant. In other words, as items of evidence they were not “independent” enough to be corroborative. As for items 1) and 2), these were equally consistent with the truth as with the falsity of her allegation because her hair and blood type could get where they were without her having been raped.

In <i>Vetrovec</i>, at p. 833, Dickson J. held that circumstantial evidence can be confirmatory even if it does not directly implicate the accused. In <i>Kehler</i>, at para. 15, Fish J. stated that corroborative evidence must be relevant to the unsavoury witness’s testimony but need not bear on a disputed part of that testimony. One author aptly described what I deem to be the logical outcome of this line of reasoning:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The findings from the Court in both <i>Vetrovec</i> and <i>Kehler</i> could lead to a conclusion that the issue of confirmatory evidence can be left on a very general level with the trier‑of‑fact. Given that the confirmatory evidence does not have to directly implicate the accused, it could be argued that essentially all other evidence supporting the Crown case is potentially capable of serving as confirmatory evidence. The rules concerning confirmatory evidence might accordingly be summarized as merely requiring that the trier‑of‑fact carefully examine the testimony of the <i>Vetrovec</i> witness in the context of the evidence as a whole and determine whether or not they believe the witness’ evidence. Such a formulation of the rules for confirmatory evidence in <i>Vetrovec </i>cautions would create relative simplicity in this area of the law and would provide a trier‑of‑fact with a broad discretion to determine whether or not it is safe for them to rely upon the evidence of a <i>Vetrovec</i> witness.</p>

For example, one option would be for judges to carefully use their common law power of exclusionary discretion (Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 40-45) to exclude testimonial evidence which is extremely prejudicial and has little probative value. Instead of looking for innovative solutions, Fish J. turns back the clock and returns to the old law, which is just as unsatisfactory now as it was before <i>Vetrovec</i>.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Ménard</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 109, Major J. wrote that “long and detailed instructions at the end of a trial may be more confusing than helpful” (para. 27).

In <i>R. v. Lifchus</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, this Court said: “A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary or frivolous doubt.&nbsp; It must not be based upon sympathy or prejudice.&nbsp; Rather, it is based on reason and common sense.&nbsp; It is logically derived from the evidence or absence of evidence” (para. 39). A nearly identical instruction could be given in a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">When told to decide whether they have a reasonable doubt that an accused is guilty, jurors are never asked to evaluate evidence piecemeal. This Court made this clear in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, and the principle from that case stands and has been applied repeatedly. If this holistic philosophy is sound for the most central principle of our criminal justice system, it must be sound for the content of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning (Seniuk, “Judicial Fact-Finding and a Theory of Credit”, at pp. 87-96).</p>

line-height:200%">[95]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The following passage from <i>Vetrovec</i>, at p. 826, including the quotation from Wigmore it contains, is instructive:</p>

<div class="Section46">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The reason for requiring corroboration is that we believe the witness has good reason to lie. We therefore want some other piece of evidence which tends to convince us that he is telling the truth. Evidence which implicates the accused does indeed serve to accomplish that purpose but it cannot be said that this is the only sort of evidence which will accredit the accomplice. This is because, as Wigmore said, the matter of credibility is an entire thing, not a separable one:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
200%">. . . whatever restores our trust in him personally restores it as a whole; if we find that he is desiring and intending to tell a true story, we shall believe one part of his story as well as another; whenever, then, by any means, that trust is restored, our object is accomplished, and it cannot matter whether the efficient circumstance related to the accused's identity or to any other matter. The important thing is, not <i>how</i> our trust is restored, but whether it <i>is</i> restored at all [<i>Wigmore on Evidence</i>, vol. 7 (Chadbourn rev. 1978), § 2059, at p. 424].</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

However, no rule of law can improve in this respect on the ordinary canons of rational reasoning, which are designed and commonly used for precisely this purpose: for drawing correct conclusions and averting false ones. [p. 149]</p>

line-height:200%">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>It suffices that there be evidence capable of causing the jurors to entertain a rational belief that the witness is telling the truth (<i>Vetrovec</i>, at p. 833), and it is not for a court of appeal to inquire beyond that point. I believe that jurors should be instructed to look for elements which reinforce the witness’s credibility, as Moldaver J.A. suggested in <i>R. v. Krugel</i> (1999), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 367 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 98: “In light of <i>Vetrovec</i>, there is only one question that must be asked in deciding whether evidence is capable of being confirmatory — does the evidence strengthen our belief that the suspect witness is telling the truth?”</p>

line-height:200%">[97]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The trial judge’s charge was fully consistent with the first three steps of the <i>Sauvé</i> framework, which I believe should constitute the complete rule for the content of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. First, he drew the jury’s attention to the problematic testimony. Second, he explained why there was a greater risk that the witnesses’ testimony was unreliable given their lifestyles and criminal backgrounds. Third, he said that it would be dangerous to convict the accused on the basis of the testimony in question in the absence of confirmation by other evidence. The charge was complete. The trial judge gave no instructions regarding independence or materiality, and that was the correct approach.</p>

The majority’s decision in this case is a step back from that trend. I share the concern of Moldaver J.A. in<i> Zebedee</i>, which Cromwell J.A. of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal expressed as follows in the companion case of <i>R. v. Smith</i>, 2007 NSCA 19, 216 C.C.C. (3d) 490: “I would not wish to see the useful guidance given in <i>Sauvé</i> and similar cases converted into a vehicle for return to ‘blind and empty formalism’ which was renounced by the Supreme Court in <i>Vetrovec</i>” (para. 121).</p>

Although the majority says that its intention is to provide guidance to trial judges (para. 14), the framework and the requirements thereof can only be seen as mandatory. It is foreseeable that courts of appeal will from now on use the four elements of the <i>Sauvé</i> framework as review checklists. Technical appeals are likely to flourish.</p>
