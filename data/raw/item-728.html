The indictment stated that the appellants had conspired with each other and with two named individuals and an unnamed person and that the conspiracy occurred between December 5, 1983 and February 19, 1984, in Montreal, Sarnia and Kitchener.&nbsp; One of the named individuals had agreed to supply an American undercover police officer at a place in Michigan with cocaine obtained from a supplier in Florida.&nbsp; When this transaction (Phase I) fell through in January 1984, this individual informed the undercover officer that the two appellants could arrange the delivery of the cocaine and set up a meeting in Sarnia for the four of them where a new deal (Phase II) was struck for the delivery of cocaine to Michigan.&nbsp; The undercover officer accepted appellants' offer the next day but this deal died around February 4, 1984.&nbsp; The named individual, who had set up the meeting, had a partner in Kitchener (the other named individual) who had been very much involved in the organization of the deal.&nbsp; The key locations for the Phase II conspiracy were Kitchener and Sarnia.&nbsp; Several months later arrangements were made between the undercover officer and these two individuals (Phase III); appellants were not involved in this third deal.</span></p>

Myny, "had died".&nbsp; The December 5 date may be an indication of when Sgt. Myny first spoke to Sue Ellen and learned that she would reveal to him the names of cocaine dealers.&nbsp; He referred to this conversation as occurring early in December.&nbsp; Although, ideally, the indictment might have referred only to the time from the January 11 or 12 to February 19, it is difficult to see what prejudice was occasioned by reference to the earlier date.&nbsp; </span></p>

Myny clearly establishes that Reidt was Harding's partner during Phase I.&nbsp; More importantly, contrary to the assertions of counsel for the appellants, Reidt was clearly involved in the Phase II conspiracy.&nbsp; For example, Reidt phoned Harding on January 9 saying:&nbsp; "I'll see you [Harding] in a bit".&nbsp; On January 11, the day before Harding contacted Myny to set up a meeting with a "new player", there were three telephone calls between Harding and Reidt.&nbsp; In the first, Harding asked Reidt if he got "a hold of what's his name".&nbsp; In the second, Reidt phoned Harding to say that, "He phoned".&nbsp; In the third, Harding phoned Reidt asking for the number of "the guy over on Weber Street".&nbsp; The evidence established that Douglas lived on Weber Street.&nbsp; Reidt said that "the guy talked to him last night".&nbsp; Further, less than two minutes after Harding had spoken by telephone to Myny on January 12, 1984, advising Myny that he had "new players" (the appellants) and setting up the January 14 meeting in Sarnia, Harding called Reidt.&nbsp; It would therefore seem that Reidt assisted Harding in making contact with Douglas.</span></p>
