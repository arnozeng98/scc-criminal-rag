 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H’s twin daughters drowned on August 4, 2002.&nbsp; The police immediately suspected that H was responsible for their deaths.&nbsp; However, they lacked the evidence needed to charge him.&nbsp; As a result, two years after the drowning, undercover officers began a “Mr.&nbsp;Big” operation by recruiting H into a fictitious criminal organization.&nbsp; At the time, H was unemployed and socially isolated — he rarely left home and when he did, he was in the company of his wife.&nbsp; After he was recruited to the organization, H worked with the undercover officers and was quickly befriended by them.&nbsp; Over the next four months, H participated in 63 “scenarios” with the undercover officers and was paid more than $15,000 for the work that he did for the organization.&nbsp; As part of that work, H was also sent on several trips across Canada — to Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver.&nbsp; H often stayed in hotels and occasionally dined in expensive restaurants during these trips, all at the fictitious organization’s expense.&nbsp; Over time, the undercover officers became H’s best friends and H came to view them as his brothers. &nbsp;According to one of the undercover officers, during this time frame, H made a bald statement in which he confessed to having drowned his daughters.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operation culminated with a meeting akin to a job interview between H and “Mr.&nbsp;Big”, the man purportedly at the helm of the criminal organization.&nbsp; During their meeting, Mr.&nbsp;Big interrogated H about the death of his daughters, seeking a confession from him. &nbsp;After initially denying responsibility, H confessed to drowning his daughters. &nbsp;Two days later, H went to the scene of the drowning with an undercover officer and explained how he had pushed his daughters into the water.&nbsp; He was arrested shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At trial, H’s confessions were admitted into evidence.&nbsp; The trial judge denied H’s request for permission to testify with the public excluded from the courtroom.&nbsp; A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed H’s appeal and ordered a new trial.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal unanimously held that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow H to testify outside the presence of the public.&nbsp; A majority of the court also concluded that the Mr.&nbsp;Big operation had breached H’s right to silence under s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i>.&nbsp; The majority excluded two of H’s confessions, the one to Mr.&nbsp;Big and the one to the undercover officer at the scene of the drowning.&nbsp; However, the majority concluded that H’s bald confession was admissible and ordered a new trial.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: &nbsp;The appeal should be dismissed.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per </i>McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. and<i> </i>LeBel, Abella, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.: There is agreement with the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances of this case, H should have been allowed to testify outside the presence of the public.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mr.&nbsp;Big technique is a Canadian invention.&nbsp; Although a version of the technique appears to have been used more than a century ago,<i> </i>its modern use began in the 1990s and, by 2008, it had been used by police across Canada more than 350 times.&nbsp; The technique, used only in cases involving serious unsolved crimes, has secured confessions and convictions in hundreds of cases.&nbsp; The confessions wrought by the technique are often detailed and confirmed by other evidence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Mr.&nbsp;Big technique comes at a price.&nbsp; Suspects confess to Mr.&nbsp;Big during pointed interrogations in the face of powerful inducements and sometimes veiled threats — and this raises the spectre of unreliable confessions.&nbsp; Unreliable confessions provide compelling evidence of guilt and present a clear and straightforward path to conviction.&nbsp; In other contexts, they have been responsible for wrongful convictions — a fact we cannot ignore.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Big confessions are also invariably accompanied by evidence that shows the accused willingly participated in “simulated crime” and was eager to join a criminal organization.&nbsp; This evidence sullies the accused’s character and, in doing so, carries with it the risk of prejudice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience in Canada and elsewhere teaches that wrongful convictions are often traceable to evidence that is either unreliable or prejudicial.&nbsp; When the two combine, they make for a potent mix — and the risk of a wrongful conviction increases accordingly.&nbsp; Wrongful convictions are a blight on our justice system.&nbsp; We must take reasonable steps to prevent them before they occur.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Big operations also run the risk of becoming abusive.&nbsp; Undercover officers provide their targets with inducements, including cash rewards, to encourage them to confess.&nbsp; They also cultivate an aura of violence by showing that those who betray the criminal organization are met with violence.&nbsp; There is a risk these operations may become coercive.&nbsp; Thought must be given to the kinds of police tactics we, as a society, are prepared to condone in pursuit of the truth.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under existing law, Mr.&nbsp;Big confessions are routinely admitted under the party admissions exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; Attempts to extend existing legal protections to Mr.&nbsp;Big operations have failed.&nbsp; This Court has held that Mr.&nbsp;Big operations do not engage the right to silence because the accused is not detained by the police at the time he or she confesses.&nbsp; And the confessions rule — which requires the Crown to prove an accused’s statement to a person in authority is “voluntary” — is inoperative because the accused does not know that Mr.&nbsp;Big is a police officer when he confesses.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, the law as it stands provides insufficient protection to accused persons who confess during Mr.&nbsp;Big operations.&nbsp; A two-pronged response is needed to address the concerns with reliability, prejudice and police misconduct raised by these operations.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first prong requires recognizing a new common law rule of evidence.&nbsp; Under this rule, where the state recruits an accused into a fictitious criminal organization and seeks to elicit a confession from him, any confession made by the accused to the state during the operation should be treated as presumptively inadmissible.&nbsp; This presumption of inadmissibility is overcome where the Crown can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the probative value of the confession outweighs its prejudicial effect.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The probative value of a Mr.&nbsp;Big confession is a function of its reliability.&nbsp; In assessing the reliability of a Mr.&nbsp;Big confession, courts must first look to the circumstances in which the statement was made.&nbsp; These circumstances include — but are not strictly limited to — the length of the operation, the number of interactions between the police and the accused, the nature of the relationship between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused, including his or her age, sophistication and mental health.&nbsp; The question for the trial judge is whether and to what extent the reliability of the confession has been called into doubt by the circumstances in which it was made.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After considering the circumstances in which the confession was made, the court should look to the confession itself for markers of reliability.&nbsp; Trial judges should consider the level of detail contained in the confession, whether it leads to the discovery of additional evidence, whether it identifies any elements of the crime that have not been made public, or whether it accurately describes mundane details of the crime the accused would likely not know had he or she not committed it.&nbsp; Confirmatory evidence is not a hard and fast requirement, but where it exists, it can provide a powerful guarantee of reliability.&nbsp; The greater the concerns raised by the circumstances in which the confession was made, the more important it will be to find markers of reliability in the confession itself or the surrounding evidence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighing the prejudicial effect of a Mr.&nbsp;Big confession is a more straightforward and familiar exercise.&nbsp; Trial judges must be aware that admitting Mr.&nbsp;Big confessions creates a risk of moral and reasoning prejudice.&nbsp; With respect to moral prejudice, the jury learns that the accused wanted to join a criminal organization and committed a host of “simulated crimes” that he believed were real.&nbsp; Moral prejudice may increase with operations that involve the accused in simulated crimes of violence, or that demonstrate the accused has a past history of violence.&nbsp; As for reasoning prejudice — defined as the risk that the jury’s focus will be distracted away from the charges before the court — it too can pose a problem depending on the length of the operation, the amount of time that must be spent detailing it, and any controversy as to whether a particular event or conversation occurred.&nbsp; However, the risk of prejudice can be mitigated by excluding certain pieces of particularly prejudicial evidence that are unessential to the narrative, or by providing limiting instructions to the jury.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, trial judges must weigh the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the confession at issue and decide whether the Crown has met its burden.&nbsp; Because trial judges, after assessing the evidence before them, are in the best position to conduct this exercise, their decision to admit or exclude a Mr.&nbsp;Big confession will be afforded deference on appeal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new common law rule of evidence goes a long way toward addressing the concerns with reliability, prejudice, and police misconduct that are raised by Mr.&nbsp;Big operations.&nbsp; It squarely tackles the problems with reliability and prejudice.&nbsp; In addition, it takes account of police misconduct both by placing the admissibility onus on the Crown and by factoring the conduct of the police into the assessment of a Mr.&nbsp;Big confession’s probative value.&nbsp; However, the common law rule of evidence I have proposed does not provide a complete response to the problems raised by Mr.&nbsp;Big operations.&nbsp; On its own, it might suggest that abusive police conduct will be forgiven so long as a demonstrably reliable confession is ultimately secured.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second prong of the response fills this gap by relying on the doctrine of abuse of process.&nbsp; The doctrine of abuse of process is intended to guard against state misconduct that threatens the integrity of the justice system and the fairness of trials.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trial judges must be aware that Mr.&nbsp;Big operations can become abusive.&nbsp; It is of course impossible to set out a precise formula for determining when a Mr.&nbsp;Big operation will reach that threshold.&nbsp; But there is one guideline that can be suggested.&nbsp; In conducting an operation, the police cannot be permitted to overcome the will of the accused and coerce a confession.&nbsp; This would almost certainly amount to an abuse of process.&nbsp; While violence and threats of violence are two forms of unacceptable coercion, operations can become abusive in other ways.&nbsp; Operations that prey on an accused’s vulnerabilities, such as mental health problems, substance addictions, or youthfulness, can also become unacceptable.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the trial judge did not apply this two pronged framework in determining the admissibility of H’s confessions.&nbsp; Nor did the parties address it in the courts below or before this Court.&nbsp; Nonetheless, this Court is in a position to decide whether the respondent’s confessions were properly admitted. &nbsp;Although a new rule has emerged, the issues have not changed: the reliability of H’s confessions, their potential for prejudice, and the conduct of the police in carrying out this Mr.&nbsp;Big operation have been in issue from the outset.&nbsp; The parties have addressed these issues, and there is a substantial record before us.&nbsp; These proceedings have also been difficult and protracted.&nbsp; More than a decade has passed since H’s daughters died.&nbsp; Ordering a new trial and leaving the admissibility of H’s confessions to be determined by a new trial judge would be tantamount to sending this case back to square one.&nbsp; That would not be in the interests of justice.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying the new common law rule to the three confessions attributed to H, it is apparent that their probative value does not outweigh their prejudicial effect.&nbsp; At the time the operation began, H was unemployed and socially isolated.&nbsp; The operation had a transformative effect on his life, lifting him out of poverty and providing him with illusory friendships.&nbsp; These financial and social inducements provided H with an overwhelming incentive to confess — either truthfully or falsely.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor do the confessions themselves contain any markers of reliability that are capable of restoring faith in their reliability.&nbsp; The confessions contain internal contradictions, and there is no confirmatory evidence capable of verifying any of the details contained within the confessions.&nbsp; When the circumstances in which the respondent’s confessions were made are considered alongside their internal inconsistencies and the lack of any confirmatory evidence, their reliability is left in serious doubt.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, these confessions — like all Mr.&nbsp;Big confessions — carried with them an obvious potential for prejudice.&nbsp; The jury heard extensive evidence that for four months H devoted himself to trying to join a criminal organization and that he repeatedly participated in what he thought were criminal acts.&nbsp; It is easy to see how the jury could come to view H with disdain.&nbsp; Here was a man who bragged about killing his three-year-old daughters to gain the approval of criminals.&nbsp; The potential for prejudice in these circumstances was significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On balance, the Crown has not met its onus.&nbsp; The probative value of H’s confessions does not outweigh their prejudicial effect.&nbsp; Put simply, these confessions are not worth the risk they pose.&nbsp; It would be unsafe to rest a conviction on this evidence.&nbsp; It is accordingly unnecessary to decide whether the police conduct amounted to an abuse of process.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having excluded H’s confessions from evidence, it is doubtful whether any admissible evidence remains upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably, could convict H of murder.&nbsp; However, the final decision on how to proceed rests with the Crown.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>Cromwell J.: There is agreement with the majority’s analysis of the legal framework that ought to apply to statements obtained from accused persons as a result of Mr.&nbsp;Big operations.&nbsp; However, the admissibility of H’s statements to the undercover officers ought to be determined at a new trial where the judge and the parties would have the benefit of the new framework set out in the majority’s reasons.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</i> Karakatsanis J.: Confessions to state agents raise particular dangers for the criminal justice system.&nbsp; The very structure of Mr.&nbsp;Big operations creates circumstances that (1)&nbsp;compromise the suspects’ autonomy, (2)&nbsp;undermine the reliability of confessions, and (3)&nbsp;raise concerns about abusive state conduct.&nbsp; Yet, Mr.&nbsp;Big confessions are not caught by the traditional rules governing confessions to the state, such as the confessions rule or the right to silence.&nbsp; The common law rule proposed by the majority fails to consistently take into account broader concerns that arise when state agents generate a confession at a cost to human dignity, personal autonomy and the administration of justice.&nbsp; The principle against self-incrimination, under s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i>, provides comprehensive and flexible protection in such circumstances.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle against self-incrimination provides the appropriate analytical framework for several reasons.&nbsp; First, Mr.&nbsp;Big operations directly engage the individual privacy, autonomy and dignity interests that the principle is meant to protect.&nbsp; Second, this approach draws on existing jurisprudence concerning the principle against self-incrimination, making it unnecessary to create a new rule.&nbsp; Third, the principle provides an opportunity to weigh intertwined concerns about reliability, autonomy and state conduct together in a nuanced way.&nbsp; Finally, it addresses suspects’ rights both during the operation and at trial.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>R. v. White</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, this Court identified four factors for determining whether the principle against self-incrimination has been violated by the production or use of a suspect’s statements: adversarial relationship; coercion; reliability; and abuse of state power.&nbsp; While these factors should be considered together, each emphasizes a particular legal interest.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The onus will be on the accused to establish a <i>prima facie</i> breach of the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; To do so, the accused must show that concerns about autonomy, reliability, and police conduct exist, as they will in nearly every Mr.&nbsp;Big operation.&nbsp; In such circumstances, the burden will shift to the Crown to establish that there is no breach.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As concerns the first factor, the relationship between H and the state was adversarial.&nbsp; As in any Mr.&nbsp;Big operation, the police deliberately set out to obtain a confession from him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the second factor, coercion is primarily concerned with the autonomy and dignity of the suspect and asks whether the suspect had a choice to speak to the authorities.&nbsp; There will almost always be some degree of coercion in a Mr.&nbsp;Big operation.&nbsp; The court should consider: the magnitude and duration of the operation, any explicit or implied threats used, any financial, social or emotional inducements applied, and the characteristics of the suspect, including any mental, physical, social or economic disadvantages.&nbsp; This approach protects the autonomy of the suspect.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge concentrated on the lack of violent coercion during the operation, but did not consider the effect of the financial and social inducements on H.&nbsp; These inducements were significant by anyone’s measure, but must be viewed as more seriously infringing H’s autonomy interests, given his extreme poverty and social isolation as well as his lack of education.&nbsp; The deceit employed was extensive.&nbsp; By preying on his vulnerabilities to such a degree, the police deprived H of meaningful choice about whether to give an incriminating statement to Mr.&nbsp;Big.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reliability enquiry focuses on the trustworthiness of any statement obtained.&nbsp; The court must execute a gatekeeper function in assessing the risk of a false confession and corroborating evidence will usually be a prerequisite to admission.&nbsp; This function is important because juries often struggle to properly assess the ultimate reliability of Mr.&nbsp;Big confessions.&nbsp; They find it difficult to believe that someone would confess to a crime that he or she did not commit and are loath to disregard a confession even where it is known to be coerced.&nbsp; This danger is compounded by the criminal propensity evidence generated during a Mr.&nbsp;Big investigation.&nbsp; An accused must either let the confession stand or explain that he or she made it to continue their new criminal lifestyle.&nbsp; Thus, confessions made to Mr.&nbsp;Big are particularly hazardous and the judge must evaluate their threshold reliability to satisfy the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; Generally, an uncorroborated, unverified confession will not be sufficiently reliable and will be inadmissible.&nbsp; However, the inverse does not necessarily hold.&nbsp; The principle against self-incrimination is not solely concerned with ensuring reliable statements; even true statements may be excluded if they were obtained through coercion that overrode the suspect’s autonomy interest.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, H had every incentive to confess, whether he committed the crime or not.&nbsp; Not only was his final confession uncorroborated, but it contained inconsistencies with the other known facts of the case.&nbsp; Likewise, H’s April 10 confession carries many of the same reliability concerns.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the fourth and final factor, the conduct of the state is examined with a view to determining whether the authorities used their position of power in an unfair, abusive, or shocking manner.&nbsp; State conduct throughout a Mr.&nbsp;Big operation must be scrutinized to determine whether it unfairly, unnecessarily or disproportionately manipulated the suspect.&nbsp; This inquiry will also consider other objectionable police tactics such as involving the suspect in dangerous conduct or exposing him or her to physical or psychological harm.&nbsp; The entrapment doctrine assists by identifying factors which may be considered in examining the conduct of the state.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the police conduct was egregious and this factor especially weighs in favour of exclusion.&nbsp; The extreme lengths to which the police went to pursue H, exploiting his weaknesses in this protracted and deeply manipulative operation, is troubling.&nbsp; This was not the usual undercover investigation where police join an existing criminal organization to witness criminals in action.&nbsp; This case is more akin to entrapment.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court should consider these factors <span style="line-height:200%">collectively, attaching weight to them, depending on the degree to which they are present in the individual case.&nbsp; </span>The four factors above clearly point to a s.&nbsp;7 violation.&nbsp; Statements obtained in violation of the principle against self-incrimination will almost always be excluded under s.&nbsp;24(2).&nbsp; This case is no exception; both the risk of a miscarriage of justice and the abusive police conduct call for exclusion.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The abuse of process doctrine <span style="line-height:200%">always remains independently available to provide a remedy where the conduct of the state rises to such a level that it risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process.&nbsp; In this case, the threshold is met.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[1]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When conventional investigations fail to solve serious crimes, police forces in Canada have sometimes used the “Mr. Big” technique.&nbsp; A Mr. Big operation begins with undercover officers luring their suspect into a fictitious criminal organization of their own making.&nbsp; Over the next several weeks or months, the suspect is befriended by the undercover officers.&nbsp; He is shown that working with the organization provides a pathway to financial rewards and close friendships.&nbsp; There is only one catch.&nbsp; The crime boss — known colloquially as “Mr. Big” — must approve the suspect’s membership in the criminal organization.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The operation culminates with an interview-like meeting between the suspect and Mr. Big.&nbsp; During the interview, Mr. Big brings up the crime the police are investigating and questions the suspect about it.&nbsp; Denials of guilt are dismissed, and Mr. Big presses the suspect for a confession.&nbsp; As Mr. Big’s questioning continues, it becomes clear to the suspect that by confessing to the crime, the big prize — acceptance into the organization — awaits.&nbsp; If the suspect does confess, the fiction soon unravels and the suspect is arrested and charged.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case provides us with an opportunity to take an in-depth look at Mr. Big confessions and the principles that should govern their admissibility.&nbsp; While such operations have a long history in this country, courts have yet to create a legal framework that addresses the unique issues which accompany such confessions.&nbsp; As we undertake that task in this case, we must strive to achieve a just balance — one which guards against the risk of wrongful convictions that stem from false confessions but which ensures the police are not deprived of the opportunity to use their skill and ingenuity in solving serious crimes.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the Mr. Big technique has proven to be an effective investigative tool.&nbsp; It has produced confessions and secured convictions in hundreds of cases that would otherwise have likely gone unsolved.&nbsp; The confessions elicited are often detailed and confirmed by other evidence.&nbsp; Manifestly, the technique has proved indispensible in the search for the truth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the technique comes with a price.&nbsp; Suspects confess to Mr. Big during pointed interrogations in the face of powerful inducements and sometimes veiled threats — and this raises the spectre of unreliable confessions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unreliable confessions present a unique danger.&nbsp; They provide compelling evidence of guilt and present a clear and straightforward path to conviction.&nbsp; Certainly in the case of conventional confessions, triers of fact have difficulty accepting that an innocent person would confess to a crime he did not commit.&nbsp; And yet our experience with wrongful convictions shows that innocent people can, and do, falsely confess.&nbsp; Unreliable confessions have been responsible for wrongful convictions — a fact we cannot ignore.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concern about Mr. Big confessions does not end there.&nbsp; The confessions are invariably accompanied by evidence that shows the accused willingly participated in “simulated crime” and was eager to join a criminal organization.&nbsp; This evidence sullies the accused’s character and, in doing so, carries with it the risk of prejudice.&nbsp; It also creates credibility hurdles that may be difficult to overcome for an accused who chooses to testify.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Experience in Canada and elsewhere teaches that wrongful convictions are often traceable to evidence that is either unreliable or prejudicial.&nbsp; When the two combine, they make for a potent mix — and the risk of a wrongful conviction increases accordingly.&nbsp; Wrongful convictions are a blight on our justice system and we must take reasonable steps to prevent them before they occur.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr. Big operations run the risk of becoming abusive.&nbsp; Undercover officers provide their targets with inducements, including cash rewards, to encourage them to confess.&nbsp; They also cultivate an aura of violence by showing that those who betray the criminal organization are met with violence.&nbsp; Thought must be given to the kinds of police tactics we, as a society, are prepared to condone in pursuit of the truth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against that background, I am of the view that a principled rule of evidence is required to assess the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions.&nbsp; For reasons that follow, I would propose that where the state recruits an accused into a fictitious criminal organization of its own making and seeks to elicit a confession from him, any confession made by the accused to the state during the operation should be treated as presumptively inadmissible.&nbsp; This presumption of inadmissibility will be overcome where the Crown can establish, on balance, that the probative value of the confession outweighs its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; In this context, the confession’s probative value is a function of its reliability.&nbsp; Its prejudicial effect stems from the harmful character evidence that necessarily accompanies its admission.&nbsp; If the Crown is unable to demonstrate that the accused’s confession is admissible, the rest of the evidence surrounding the Mr. Big operation becomes irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial judges must also carefully scrutinize the conduct of the police to determine if an abuse of process has occurred.&nbsp; No matter how reliable the confession, the courts cannot condone state conduct — such as physical violence — that coerces the target of a Mr. Big operation into confessing.&nbsp; Where an accused establishes that an abuse of process has occurred, the court can fashion an appropriate remedy, including the exclusion of the confession or a stay of proceedings.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, at the end of a lengthy Mr. Big operation, the respondent confessed to murdering his two young daughters.&nbsp; At trial, his confessions were admitted into evidence.&nbsp; A majority of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal concluded that two of the three confessions should have been excluded, but allowed a third confession to be introduced and, on that basis, ordered a new trial.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the framework I propose here, I would exclude all three of the respondent’s confessions.&nbsp; Each of them came about in the face of overwhelming inducements.&nbsp; This calls into question their reliability — and there is no confirmatory evidence capable of restoring our faith in them.&nbsp; As such, they carry little if any probative value.&nbsp; On the other hand, the bad character evidence accompanying the confessions carries with it an obvious and serious potential for prejudice.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the prejudicial effect of the respondent’s confessions outweighs their probative value.</p>

New Brunswick (Attorney General)</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480, this Court set out three factors trial judges are to consider in making such an order: (1) the availability of reasonable and effective alternatives; (2) whether the order is limited as much as possible; and (3) the importance of the order’s objectives and its probable effects when weighed against the importance of openness and the particular expression that will be limited.</p>

Todd</i> (1901), 4 C.C.C. 514 (Man. K.B.), at p. 523).&nbsp; According to the B.C.

E. Moore, P. Copeland and R. A. Schuller, “Deceit, Betrayal and the Search for Truth: Legal and Psychological Perspectives on the ‘Mr. Big’ Strategy” (2009), 55<i> Crim.

Hathway</i>, 2007 SKQB 48, 292 Sask. R. 7, provides a stark example.&nbsp; In that case, undercover officers simulated an assault on a woman who had crossed the criminal organization.&nbsp; During the beating, officers threatened to kill the woman, her husband, and her infant child.&nbsp; The accused watched as undercover officers threw the bloodied woman into the trunk of a car.&nbsp;</p>

Copeland</i>, 1999 BCCA 744, 131 B.C.A.C. 264, where a confession elicited through a Mr. Big operation led the police to the victim’s previously undiscovered body).&nbsp;</p>

Bates</i>, 2009 ABQB 379, 468 A.R. 158, where an accused, though properly convicted of manslaughter, overstated his involvement by falsely confessing to Mr. Big that he was the person who shot a rival drug dealer).</p>

Evans</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653, at p. 664;<i> R. v. Osmar</i>, 2007 ONCA 50, 84 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 53).&nbsp; The admissibility of party admissions flows from the adversarial nature of our trial system, and the belief that “what a party has previously stated can be admitted against the party in whose mouth it does not lie to complain of the unreliability of his or her own statements” (<i>Evans</i>, at p. 664).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Attempts to extend existing legal protections to Mr. Big operations have failed.&nbsp; This Court has held that Mr. Big operations do not engage the right to silence because the accused is not detained by the police at the time he or she confesses (see <i>R. v. McIntyre</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 480; <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151).&nbsp; And the confessions rule — which requires the Crown to prove an accused’s statement to a person in authority is “voluntary” — is inoperative because the accused does not know that Mr. Big is a police officer when he confesses (see <i>R. v. Grandinetti</i>, 2005 SCC 5, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under existing law, it appears that defence counsel have only two options for challenging the admissibility of these confessions: under the doctrine of abuse of process, or under a trial judge’s overriding discretion to exclude evidence that is more prejudicial than probative.&nbsp; Trial judges have only rarely excluded Mr. Big confessions under either of these doctrines.&nbsp; Indeed, the parties could find no case in which a Mr. Big confession was excluded as an abuse of process, and only one case in which a confession was excluded on the basis that its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value (see <i>R. v. Creek</i>, 1998 CanLII 3209 (B.C.S.C.)).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It seems a matter of common sense that the potential for a false confession increases in proportion to the nature and extent of the inducements held out to the accused.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, this view is supported by academic literature (see <i>R. v. Oickle</i>, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 39 and 44;<i> </i>S. M.

A. Martin, “The Admissibility of Confessions and Statements” (1963), 5 <i>Crim. L.Q. </i>35, at p. 35).&nbsp; Under the confessions rule, we recognize that unreliable<i> </i>confessions made by an accused pose particular dangers, as juries often attach great weight to the accused’s own words.&nbsp; When an accused falsely confesses to a crime, the risk of a wrongful conviction becomes acute.&nbsp; This Court recognized as much in <i>Oickle</i>, when it noted that false confessions have played an “important role” in <span style="line-height:200%">cases where wrongful convictions have occurred (para. 36).&nbsp; Subsequent research has confirmed that risk.&nbsp; In 40 of the first 250 DNA exonerations in the United States, for example, the accused was found to have falsely confessed to the crime (see </span>B. L. Garrett, “The Substance of False Confessions” (2010), 62 <i>Stan. L. Rev.</i> 1051).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second concern with Mr. Big confessions — and one that distinguishes them from confessions made in other contexts — is that they are invariably accompanied by prejudicial facts regarding the accused’s character.&nbsp; Putting these confessions into evidence requires showing the jury that the accused wanted to join a criminal organization and that he participated in “simulated” crimes that he believed were real.&nbsp; The absence of a consistent approach in assessing the admissibility of these confessions sits uneasily with the general rule that bad character evidence is presumptively inadmissible for the Crown.&nbsp; This centuries-old rule prohibits the Crown from leading evidence of misconduct engaged in by the accused that is unrelated to the charges before the court, unless it can demonstrate that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect (see <i>R. v. Handy</i>, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[74]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bad character evidence causes two kinds of prejudice.&nbsp; It causes “moral prejudice” by marring the character of the accused in the eyes of the jury, thereby creating a risk that the jury will reason from the accused’s general disposition to the conclusion that he is guilty of the crime charged, or that he is deserving of punishment in any event (<i>Handy</i>, at para. 31).&nbsp; And it causes “reasoning prejudice” by distracting the jury’s focus away from the offence charged, toward the accused’s extraneous acts of misconduct (<i>ibid.</i>).&nbsp; As this Court held in <i>Handy</i>, the “poisonous potential” of bad character evidence cannot be doubted (para. 138).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[75]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When a Mr. Big confession is admitted, the character evidence that accompanies it places the accused in a difficult situation.&nbsp; In these cases, the accused is often obliged, as a tactical necessity, to testify in order to explain why he falsely confessed to Mr Big.&nbsp; The character evidence that has already been admitted is damaging in this context because it shrouds the accused with an aura of distrust before he or she steps into the witness box.&nbsp; This distrust is compounded when the accused asks the jury to disregard his confession because he was lying when he gave it.&nbsp; And all of this furnishes the Crown with ample fodder for a forceful attack on the accused’s credibility in cross-examination.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[76]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the well-established presumption that bad character evidence is inadmissible, it is routinely admitted in Mr. Big cases because it provides the relevant context needed to understand how the accused’s pivotal confession came about.&nbsp; Indeed, even the accused comes to depend on this evidence in order to show the nature of the inducements he faced and the reason his confession should not be believed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[77]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the prejudicial effect of Mr. Big confessions is a substantial concern, especially since these confessions may also be unreliable.&nbsp; Putting evidence before a jury that is both unreliable and prejudicial invites a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; The law must respond to these dangers.&nbsp; The fact that there are no proven wrongful convictions in cases involving Mr. Big confessions provides little comfort.&nbsp; The criminal justice system cannot afford to wait for miscarriages of justice before taking reasonable steps to prevent them.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purposes of this two-pronged approach are to protect an accused’s right to a fair trial under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>,<i> </i>and to preserve the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; Those are the ends that must ultimately be achieved.&nbsp; This approach strives to reach them by ensuring that only those confessions that are more probative than prejudicial, and which do not result from abuse, are admitted into evidence.&nbsp;</p>

Harrer</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562).&nbsp; This is because “the general principle that an accused is entitled to a fair trial cannot be entirely reduced to specific rules” (<i>ibid.</i>, at para. 23).&nbsp; It is impossible to predict every factual scenario that could present itself.&nbsp; As such, I do not foreclose the possibility that, in an exceptional case, trial fairness may require that a Mr. Big confession be excluded even where the specific rules I have proposed would see the confession admitted.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[100]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What factors are relevant in assessing the reliability of a Mr. Big confession?&nbsp; A parallel can perhaps be drawn between the assessment of “threshold reliability” that occurs under the principled approach to hearsay.&nbsp; Under the principled approach, hearsay becomes admissible where it is both necessary and reliable.&nbsp; Reliability can generally be established in one of two ways: by showing that the statement is trustworthy, or by establishing that its reliability can be sufficiently tested at trial (<i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57,<i> </i>[2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at paras. 61-63).&nbsp; The latter route to reliability is often met through an opportunity to cross-examine the hearsay declarant, but this has no application in the present context because the accused is not a compellable witness.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[101]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the factors used to demonstrate the trustworthiness of a hearsay statement are apposite.&nbsp; In assessing the trustworthiness of a hearsay statement, courts look to the circumstances in which the statement was made, and whether there is any confirmatory evidence (<i>Khelawon</i>, at paras. 62 and 100).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[102]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Confessions derive their persuasive force from the fact that they are against the accused’s self-interest.&nbsp; People do not normally confess to crimes they have not committed (<i>Hodgson</i>, at para. 60).&nbsp; But the circumstances in which Mr. Big confessions are elicited can undermine that supposition.&nbsp; Thus, the first step in assessing the reliability of a Mr. Big confession is to examine those circumstances and assess the extent to which they call into question the reliability of the confession.&nbsp; These circumstances include — but are not strictly limited to — the length of the operation, the number of interactions between the police and the accused, the nature of the relationship between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused, including his or her age, sophistication, and mental health.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[103]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Special note should be taken of the mental health and age of the accused.&nbsp; In the United States, where empirical data on false confessions is more plentiful, researchers have found that those with mental illnesses or disabilities, and youth, present a much greater risk of falsely confessing (Garrett, at p. 1064).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; A confession arising from a Mr. Big operation that comes from a young person or someone suffering from a mental illness or disability will raise greater reliability concerns.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[104]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In listing these factors, I do not mean to suggest that trial judges are to consider them mechanically and check a box when they apply.&nbsp; That is not the purpose of the exercise.&nbsp; Instead, trial judges must examine all the circumstances leading to and surrounding the making of the confession — with these factors in mind — and assess whether and to what extent the reliability of the confession is called into doubt.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Determining when the probative value of a Mr. Big confession surpasses its potential for prejudice will never be an exact science.&nbsp; As Justice Binnie observed in <i>Handy</i>, probative value and prejudicial effect are two variables which “do not operate on the same plane” (para. 148).&nbsp; Probative value is concerned with “proof of an issue”, while prejudicial effect is concerned with “the fairness of the trial” (<i>ibid.</i>).&nbsp; To be sure, there will be easy cases at the margins.&nbsp; But more common will be the difficult cases that fall in between.&nbsp; In such cases, trial judges will have to lean on their judicial experience to decide whether the value of a confession exceeds its cost.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the inexactness of the exercise, it is one for which our trial judges are well prepared.&nbsp; Trial judges routinely weigh the probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence.&nbsp; And as mentioned, they are already asked to examine the reliability of evidence in a number of different contexts, as well as the prejudicial effect of bad character evidence.&nbsp; They are well positioned to do the same here.&nbsp; Because trial judges, after assessing the evidence before them, are in the best position to weigh the probative value and prejudicial effect of the evidence, their decision to admit or exclude a Mr. Big confession will be afforded deference on appeal.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[112]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I should not, however, be taken as suggesting that police misconduct will be forgiven so long as a demonstrably reliable confession is ultimately secured.&nbsp; That state of affairs would be unacceptable, as this Court has long recognized that there are “inherent limits” on the power of the state to “manipulate people and events for the purpose of . . . obtaining convictions” (<i>R. v. Mack</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 941). <i>&nbsp;</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[113]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this is where the doctrine of abuse of process must serve its purpose.&nbsp; After all, the doctrine is intended to guard against state conduct that society finds unacceptable, and which threatens the integrity of the justice system (<i>R. v. Babos</i>, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 35).&nbsp; Moreover, the doctrine provides trial judges with a wide discretion to issue a remedy — including the exclusion of evidence or a stay of proceedings —<i> </i>where doing so is necessary to preserve the integrity of the justice system or the fairness of the trial (<i>ibid.</i>,<i> </i>at para. 32).&nbsp; The onus lies on the accused to establish that an abuse of process has occurred.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[114]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that, thus far, the doctrine has provided little protection in the context of Mr. Big operations.&nbsp; This may be due in part to this Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Fliss</i>, 2002 SCC 16, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 535, where Binnie J., writing for the majority, described the Mr. Big technique as “skillful police work” (para. 21).&nbsp; But the solution, in my view, is to reinvigorate the doctrine in this context, not to search for an alternative framework to guard against the very same problem.&nbsp; The first step toward restoring the doctrine as an effective guard against police misconduct in this context is to remind trial judges that these operations can become abusive, and that they must carefully scrutinize how the police conduct them.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[115]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is of course impossible to set out a precise formula for determining when a Mr. Big operation will become abusive.&nbsp; These operations are too varied for a bright-line rule to apply.&nbsp; But there is one guideline that can be suggested.&nbsp; Mr. Big operations are designed to induce confessions.&nbsp; The mere presence of inducements is not problematic (<i>Oickle</i>, at para. 57).&nbsp; But police conduct, including inducements and threats, becomes problematic in this context when it approximates coercion.&nbsp; In conducting these operations, the police cannot be permitted to overcome the will of the accused and coerce a confession.&nbsp; This would almost certainly amount to an abuse of process.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[116]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Physical violence or threats of violence provide examples of coercive police tactics.&nbsp; A confession derived from physical violence or threats of violence against an accused will not be admissible — no matter how reliable — because this, quite simply, is something the community will not tolerate (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Singh</i>, 2013 ONCA 750, 118 O.R. (3d) 253).&nbsp;</p>

Taking advantage of these vulnerabilities threatens trial fairness and the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; As this Court has said on many occasions, misconduct that offends the community’s sense of fair play and decency will amount to an abuse of process and warrant the exclusion of the statement.</p>

 <p class="Title4LevelTitre4Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why Use This Two-Pronged Approach?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[119]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have seen, Mr. Big operations raise three interrelated concerns — reliability, prejudice, and police misconduct.&nbsp; I have proposed two separate tests that, taken together, address all three.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[120]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason for this lies in the analytically distinct problems that the three concerns raise.&nbsp; Reliability and prejudice are fundamentally evidentiary issues.&nbsp; They are concerned with the quality of the evidence these operations produce.&nbsp; Indeed, they do not emerge as problems at all until a Mr. Big confession is admitted at trial.&nbsp; The concern that the police may engage in misconduct, by contrast, is focused on the behaviour of the state in eliciting the evidence.&nbsp; To be sure, there is significant overlap between the concerns.&nbsp; Police misconduct is more likely to produce an unreliable confession.&nbsp; But the overlap is not perfect.&nbsp; For example, a confession elicited during a Mr. Big operation where there has been no misconduct may still turn out to be unreliable and prejudicial.&nbsp; Similarly, a confession that <i>is </i>the product of misconduct may turn out to be reliable.&nbsp; Thus, in order to take complete account of both issues, two legal tools are required — one that looks directly at the evidence, and one that serves as a check on the conduct of the police.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[121]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have turned to a common law rule of evidence to address the concerns these confessions raise with reliability and prejudice.&nbsp; Without question, unreliable and prejudicial evidence implicate rights under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, including the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.&nbsp; But our common law rules of evidence are, and must be, capable of protecting the constitutional rights of the accused.&nbsp; It is axiomatic that the common law must be developed in a manner consistent with the fundamental values enshrined in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>(see <i>RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd</i>., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at p. 603).&nbsp; Our rules of evidence have embraced this constitutional imperative and have evolved into principled, flexible tools that are “highly sensitive to the due process interests of the accused” (D. Paciocco, “Charter Tracks: Twenty-Five Years of Constitutional Influence on the Criminal Trial Process and Rules of Evidence” (2008), 40 <i>S.C.L.R. </i>(2d) 309, at p. 311).&nbsp; The common law rule of evidence I have proposed fits comfortably with this Court’s approach in the post-<i>Charter </i>era.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 697).&nbsp; The doctrine is therefore well suited to providing a check against police misconduct in this context.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[123]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two-pronged approach I have articulated is also consistent with the demands of the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; The principle against self-incrimination has two purposes: protecting against abusive state conduct, and guarding against unreliable confessions (<i>Hebert</i>, at p. 175; <i>R. v. Jones</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229, at p. 250).&nbsp; These protections flow from “the value placed by Canadian society upon individual privacy, personal autonomy and dignity” (<i>White</i>, at para. 43). However, the principle does not act as a free-standing legal protection.&nbsp; Rather, the principle is a “general organizing principle of criminal law from which particular rules can be derived” (<i>Jones</i>, at p. 249)<i>.</i>&nbsp; Where its underlying rationale suggests that legal protection is needed in a specific context, but the law provides for none, the principle can be used to fashion a “contextually-sensitive” new rule to address the gap in the law (<i>White</i>, at para. 45).<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; In my view, the common law rule of evidence I have proposed acts, along with the abuse doctrine, as yet another specific legal protection that derives from the general principle and its underlying rationale.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[124]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike my colleague Karakatsanis J., I would not respond to the concerns Mr. Big confessions raise by subjecting them to an assessment under the framework developed by this Court in <i>White</i>.&nbsp; It is true that the <i>White</i> test was used to determine whether admitting a class of statements made by an accused under statutory compulsion would offend the principle against self-incrimination.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp; But <i>White </i>did not transform the principle against self-incrimination from a general organizing principle into a freestanding legal rule.&nbsp; To the contrary, the Court was careful to note that the principle provided only “residual protections” in the absence of “specific common law and <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rules”, whether existing or new (paras. 44-45).&nbsp; In that regard, the Court in <i>White </i>observed that the principle “demands different things at different times” and that the task in each case is “to determine exactly what the principle demands, if anything, within the particular context at issue” (<i>ibid.</i>).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[125]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus the general factors identified in <i>White </i>are best understood as serving to illustrate that Mr. Big operations raise concerns with the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp;&nbsp; But <i>White </i>does not tell us what the principle demands in this context, nor does it assist in fashioning an appropriate response.&nbsp; That task can only be accomplished — as <i>White</i> itself contemplated — by tailoring the two-pronged approach of a common law evidentiary rule and the doctrine of abuse of process, to address the particular concerns raised by Mr. Big operations.&nbsp; This is how the confessions rule and the right to silence operate to address the concerns with self-incrimination that arise during conventional police interrogations and upon detention.&nbsp; And it is how my two-pronged approach addresses the challenges posed by Mr. Big operations.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[127]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset, I acknowledge that these reasons recast the test for determining the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the trial judge did not apply this test in determining the admissibility of the respondent’s confessions.&nbsp; In addition, the arguments in the courts below, and before this Court, did not squarely address whether the respondent’s confessions ought to be admitted under this framework.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[128]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, I am of the view that this Court is in a position to decide whether the respondent’s statements were properly admitted — and that we ought to do so.&nbsp; Although the precise test for determining the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions has changed, the issues have not.&nbsp; The reliability of the respondent’s confessions, their potential for prejudice, and the conduct of the police in carrying out this Mr. Big operation have been in issue from the outset.&nbsp; The parties have addressed these issues, and there is a substantial record before us.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[129]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does applying this test require overturning the trial judge’s findings of fact.&nbsp; The details of the Mr. Big operation that was conducted in this case are not in dispute.&nbsp; In assessing the admissibility of the respondent’s confessions, the trial judge’s reasons focused on the threatening and intimidating conduct of the undercover officers.&nbsp; The trial judge found that the respondent was not threatened by the officers (see, e.g., para. 65).&nbsp; Assessing the admissibility of the respondent’s confessions simply requires analyzing the uncontroversial facts through a different lens — that of the common law rule of evidence I have proposed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[130]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, these proceedings have been difficult and protracted.&nbsp; Nearly a decade has passed since the respondent was arrested and charged with the murder of his daughters.&nbsp; Concerns with the respondent’s mental health prompted the appointment of <i>amicus curiae</i> at this Court and at the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; Ordering a new trial and leaving the admissibility of the respondent’s confessions to be determined by a new trial judge would be tantamount to sending this case back to square one.&nbsp; In my view, that would not be in the interests of justice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Title5LevelTitre5Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The June 9 and June 11, 2005 Confessions</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[131]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The June 9 confession was elicited by Mr. Big during his meeting with the respondent.&nbsp; The June 11 confession is a brief re-enactment of how the drowning occurred.&nbsp; As mentioned, these confessions were critical to the Crown’s case against the respondent.&nbsp; Because the re-enactment followed from the respondent’s confession to Mr. Big, these confessions are intertwined, and I will consider their admissibility together.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[132]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first step is to take stock of the probative value of these confessions, which hinges on an assessment of their reliability.&nbsp; This requires considering the circumstances in which the confessions were made, and whether the confessions contain any markers of reliability.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[133]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning first to the circumstances in which these confessions were made, I am of the view that the circumstances cast serious doubt on the reliability of the respondent’s confessions.&nbsp; At the time the Mr. Big operation began, the respondent was socially isolated, unemployed, and living on welfare.&nbsp; Over the next four months, the Mr. Big operation transformed the respondent’s life, becoming its focal point.&nbsp; The respondent participated in 63 “scenarios” in which he worked with undercover officers.&nbsp; He also had near daily phone contact with two of these officers, Jim and Paul, who became his closest friends.&nbsp; Even when the respondent was not working with the undercover officers, much of his time was devoted to the work doled out to him by the fictitious organization.&nbsp; He spent long hours driving across Newfoundland, spending nights in hotels, as he delivered mysterious packages and cargo.&nbsp; By all accounts, this was a lengthy and intense operation.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[134]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With this transformation of the respondent’s life came powerful inducements.&nbsp; Financially, the Mr. Big operation lifted the respondent out of poverty.&nbsp; Undercover officers paid the respondent over $15,000 in cash for his work.&nbsp; And they promised him much greater financial rewards in the future if he was admitted into the organization; the undercover officers had him count hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, and told him a $25,000 pay day was coming if he was allowed to participate in an upcoming “big job”.&nbsp; There was a corresponding change in the respondent’s lifestyle.&nbsp; Dinners at expensive restaurants became common.&nbsp; Paul bought the respondent new clothes to wear, and the respondent relied on Paul to teach him how to behave during their dinners, as dining at expensive restaurants was “all new to him” and he often felt uncomfortable.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[135]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent attested to the powerful impact of these financial inducements at the outset of his meeting with Mr. Big, telling the crime boss that his life had been “really rough” before he started working for the organization, and that he had been unable to afford even a bed to sleep on.&nbsp; He told Mr. Big that he had come from having “nothing”, that working for the organization had lifted him out of those dire circumstances, and that he would “never ever forget” how good they had been to him.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[136]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At least as enticing as the financial inducements held out to the respondent was the promise of friendship that came with working for the criminal organization.&nbsp; The undercover officers — aware of the respondent’s social isolation — sought to become his “best friend”.&nbsp; At the outset of the operation, the officers plotted to separate the respondent from his wife, telling him that she was not allowed to accompany him as he traveled across the country working for the organization.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[137]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With remarkable ease, the officers quickly and deeply engrained themselves in the respondent’s life.&nbsp; By early April, less than two full months into the operation, the respondent told Jim and Paul that they were like brothers to him and that he loved them — a sentiment he would repeat throughout the rest of the operation.&nbsp; Indeed, the respondent preached that loyalty to this “family” was more important to him than money.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[138]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The depth of the respondent’s commitment to the organization and the undercover officers can hardly be exaggerated.&nbsp; The respondent would constantly call his friends — Jim and Paul — looking for work, and he would anxiously await their planned meetings.&nbsp; He told the officers he was planning to leave Newfoundland so he could work for the organization full time.&nbsp; He even purported a willingness to leave his wife if that is what it would take to join the organization.&nbsp; And when he was finally arrested on June 13, the respondent’s first call for help was naturally placed to Jim.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[139]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was in these circumstances that the respondent confessed to Mr. Big and participated in the re-enactment.&nbsp; When he entered their June 9 meeting, the respondent knew that his ticket out of poverty and social isolation was at stake.&nbsp; Jim implored him to be “honest” with the boss.&nbsp; Early on in the interrogation, Mr. Big drove home the importance of honesty, telling the respondent that “the minute the trust is gone . . . everything is gone”.&nbsp; The conversation quickly turned to the death of the respondent’s daughters, and Mr. Big immediately asserted that the respondent had killed them.&nbsp; When the respondent denied it and claimed to have had a seizure, Mr. Big perfunctorily dismissed this explanation as a lie: “No don’t lie to me . . . don’t go with the seizure stuff . . . [y]ou’re lying to me on this okay.”</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[140]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The circumstances left the respondent with a stark choice: confess to Mr. Big or be deemed a liar by the man in charge of the organization he so desperately wanted to join.&nbsp; In my view, these circumstances, considered as a whole, presented the respondent with an overwhelming incentive to confess — either truthfully or falsely.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[141]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having determined that the circumstances in which these confessions were made cast serious doubt on the reliability of the respondent’s confessions, the next question is whether these confessions contain any indicators of reliability.&nbsp; In my view, they do not.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[142]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the respondent’s description of how the crime was committed is somewhat inconsistent.&nbsp; In his meeting with Mr. Big, the respondent started off by denying that he killed his daughters.&nbsp; Later, he said that they “fell” into the water.&nbsp; After further pressing by Mr. Big, the respondent claimed that he pushed his daughters into the water by striking them with his shoulder.&nbsp; But when he participated in the re-enactment with Jim two days later, his explanation changed again.&nbsp; When Jim knelt down next to the respondent and asked him to demonstrate how he pushed his daughters, the respondent nudged him with his knee.&nbsp; He had to use his knee because Jim, kneeling down, was not tall enough for the respondent to shove with his shoulder.&nbsp; The same would undoubtedly have been true for his small children.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[143]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More important than these inconsistencies is the complete lack of confirmatory evidence.&nbsp; Given the peculiar circumstances of the case, this is unsurprising.&nbsp; The issue has always been whether the respondent’s daughters drowned accidentally or were murdered.&nbsp; There was never any question that the respondent was present when his daughters entered the water.&nbsp; All of the objectively verifiable details of the respondent’s confession (e.g., his knowledge of the location of the drowning) flow from his acknowledged presence at the time the drowning occurred.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[144]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the circumstances in which the respondent’s confessions were made are considered alongside their internal inconsistencies and the lack of any confirmatory evidence, their reliability is left in serious doubt, and I am forced to conclude that their probative value is low.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[145]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, these confessions — like all Mr. Big confessions — carried with them an obvious potential for prejudice.&nbsp; The jury heard extensive evidence that — for four months — the respondent devoted his entire life to trying to join a criminal gang.&nbsp; They heard that he repeatedly participated in what he thought were criminal acts, including transporting stolen property and smuggling alcohol.&nbsp; On one occasion, he and Jim, wearing balaclavas, broke into a car to steal a package from it.&nbsp; The jury was repeatedly told that the respondent had described himself as having “no limits”, and that he would do anything “as long as the trust was there”.&nbsp; And it is easy to see how the jury could come to view the respondent with disdain.&nbsp; Here was a man who bragged about killing his three-year-old daughters to gain the approval of a group of criminals.&nbsp; The potential for moral prejudice in these circumstances was significant.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[146]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Comparing the probative value and prejudicial effect of these confessions leads me to conclude that their limited probative value is outweighed by their prejudicial effect.&nbsp; Put simply, these confessions are not worth the risk they pose.&nbsp; In my view, it would be unsafe to rest a conviction on this evidence.</p>
 <p class="Title5LevelTitre5Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The April 10 Confession</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[147]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reach the same conclusion with respect to the respondent’s alleged April 10 confession.&nbsp; This confession also suffers from serious reliability concerns.&nbsp; Although unprompted, it came about during a conversation in which the respondent and Jim were bragging about their willingness to engage in violence.&nbsp; By this time, the respondent was already under the spell of powerful financial and social inducements.&nbsp; The confession came after two months and more than 30 scenarios with undercover officers, at a time when the respondent had already begun professing his love for Jim and Paul.&nbsp; Importantly, the confession itself contains no details — it amounts to a bald assertion by the respondent that he killed his daughters and that he “planned it”.&nbsp; Finally, the confession was not recorded and the respondent denies making it, which only makes it harder to assess its probative value.&nbsp; On the other hand, admitting this confession into evidence carries with it all of the attendant prejudice I have already discussed.&nbsp; In my view, the probative value of this confession does not outweigh its prejudicial effect.</p>
 <p class="Title4LevelTitre4Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Abuse of Process</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[148]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given my conclusion that the respondent’s confessions must be excluded under the common law, it is not necessary to consider whether the police conduct in this case amounted to an abuse of process.&nbsp; But there is no denying that this was an extremely intensive Mr. Big operation, and one that preyed upon the respondent’s poverty and social isolation.&nbsp; In addition, the respondent had a seizure in front of an undercover officer.&nbsp; The respondent’s past seizures had caused his licence to be suspended to protect against the risk that a seizure would cause him to have an accident while driving.&nbsp; However, the operation continued after this seizure, and undercover officers continued to send the respondent long distances over public roads in order to make deliveries for the fictitious criminal organization.&nbsp; The respondent submits that this placed his and the public’s safety at risk, and that this conduct warrants excluding the confessions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[149]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without question, the police conduct in this case raises significant concerns, and might well amount to an abuse of process.&nbsp; However, this is not how the issue was presented at trial.&nbsp; At trial, the respondent took issue with the threatening and intimidating conduct of the officers, and the trial judge rejected those arguments.&nbsp; Given this, and the fact that there is no need to decide the matter, I do not believe this is an appropriate case to decide whether an abuse of process has been established.</p>
 <p class="Title1LevelTitre1Niveau-AltL" style="text-indent:-.55in"><span style="text-decoration:none">VI.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Disposition</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[150]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal excluded the respondent’s June 9 and 11 confessions and quashed his convictions.&nbsp; It ordered a new trial on the basis that the respondent’s April 10 confession was admissible, and that it provided a “sliver” of evidence upon which a jury could convict the respondent of murder (para. 258).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[151]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have concluded that the April 10 confession must also be excluded.&nbsp; As such, it is doubtful whether any admissible evidence remains upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably, could convict.&nbsp; However, the final decision on how to proceed rests with the Crown.&nbsp; In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are the reasons delivered by</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[152]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Cromwell J.</span> — I agree with my colleague Moldaver J.’s analysis of the legal framework that ought to apply to statements obtained from accused persons as a result of “Mr.&nbsp;Big” operations. I also agree with his analysis of the question of whether the trial judge erred in law in his approach to the respondent’s request that he be allowed to testify with the public excluded from the courtroom. My only point of disagreement with my colleague is with respect to whether this Court should decide the question of whether Mr. Hart’s statements to the undercover officers are admissible. In my view, we should not. I would therefore uphold the Court of Appeal’s order for a new trial, but leave the question of admissibility of the statements to the trial judge, to be decided in accordance with the framework set out in Moldaver J.’s reasons. I reach this conclusion for four reasons.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[153]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, we have in this record three versions from Mr. Hart himself of what happened to the children. One is that he panicked. This is the version that he doggedly maintained under extensive and challenging police interrogation.&nbsp; The second is that he had an epileptic seizure. Mr. Hart contacted the police, told them that he had not been truthful with them in his earlier interrogations and recounted this version of events. The third version is that he deliberately killed them, the version that Mr. Hart told to the undercover officers — allegedly twice — during the Mr. Big operation.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[154]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is in the interests of the proper administration of justice that Mr. Hart’s involvement, if any, in the death of these helpless children should be determined at a trial, applying the correct legal framework, which we have now established.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[155]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Court today sets out, for the first time, a comprehensive framework for dealing with the admissibility of statements obtained in the course of Mr. Big operations. This framework is significantly different from the one advanced on behalf of Mr. Hart at trial and considered by the trial judge and also from the approach adopted by the majority of the Court of Appeal. In my respectful view, it is fundamentally unfair for an appellate court to apply this new legal framework to the evidentiary record developed at trial, a record developed to address markedly different legal issues. The Crown submitted, and not at all implausibly, that if the issue of vulnerability, for example, had been advanced at trial, the Crown would have adduced additional and different evidence: transcript, at pp. 32-34.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[156]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, although the legal issues in relation to the admissibility of Mr.&nbsp;Hart’s statements are different in light of our holding in this case, the findings made by the trial judge nonetheless convince me that it would be unwise for this Court to attempt to apply this new framework to the existing record.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[157]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Mr. Hart maintained that he was “intimidated, scared and felt trapped in his ability to get out” and that his motive to lie about having murdered his children was “the money, the friendships he created with undercover operators, the lifestyle and the chance to get out of Newfoundland”: trial judge’s <i>voir dire</i> reasons, 2007 NLTD 74, 265 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 266, at para. 33.&nbsp; Mr. Hart argued at trial that his statements resulted from implied threats, coercions and psychological coercion: <i>ibid.</i>, at para. 42.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[158]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, including Mr. Hart, flatly rejected these contentions as having no foundation in fact. The trial judge found as a fact that Mr. Hart was offered the opportunity to stop his involvement at any time: “[h]e had numerous chances to leave the operation, but made no effort to do so” (<i>voir dire</i> reasons, at para. 61). In fact, Mr.&nbsp;Hart, according to the trial judge, “continued to show his willingness to become more involved and to take greater risks.&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Hart wanted to work and continually pressured [the undercover officers] for more work outside of Newfoundland”: <i>ibid.</i>, at paras. 59 and 61.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[159]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also considered Mr. Hart’s position that his statements should be excluded because they did not meet the threshold requirements of reliability. The statements, argued Mr. Hart, were the result of implied threats and intimidation and occurred in the context of paying him to perform illegal activities. In light of all these circumstances, the statements did not meet the required threshold reliability for admission.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[160]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected these submissions: <i>voir dire </i>reasons, at paras. 136-42.&nbsp; He referred to his earlier findings that there was no intimidation or coercion. He also found that the motive to lie advanced by Mr. Hart did not make sense. Why would Mr. Hart risk being caught in his own lie to the “boss” in an attempt to gain the confidence of the organization, after being warned of what the consequences of lying would be shortly before the interview (para. 138)?.&nbsp; As the trial judge explained:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">It is true that Mr. Hart wanted into the organization and he did have a motive to lie, but there was reason for him to come clean with the “boss”, especially when coming clean meant any potential problem Mr.&nbsp;Hart may have had could be eliminated by the very person he was telling the problem to. It is interesting to note that Mr. Hart actually went to a WalMart store and stood in front of a video camera to have his photo taken at a designated time.

This is the April 10, 2005 statement. The evidence was that Mr. Hart showed the officer a picture of the twins and said that they were his own blood but that he had killed them and had planned it: 2012 NLCA 61, 327 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 178, <i>per </i>Barry J.A., at para. 10. Mr. Hart denied making this statement in his <i>voir dire</i> evidence. It is not clear to me that this statement would inevitably be excluded at a new trial on the framework governing admissibility established in Moldaver J.’s reasons. Of course, if ruled admissible, it would be for the jury to decide whether Mr. Hart made this statement and what weight, if any, to give it. The Court of Appeal refused to exclude this statement, leaving its admissibility to be determined at a new trial: para. 258.&nbsp; I agree with that conclusion.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[164]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mr. Big technique is a Canadian innovation that has proven effective in resolving intractable criminal investigations.&nbsp; During a typical Mr. Big operation, undercover police officers befriend the suspect and induct him into a fictional criminal organization.&nbsp; Over time, they secure his loyalty and trust.&nbsp; Ultimately, they introduce the target to the leader of the organization, who requires him to admit his involvement in the offence the police are investigating.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[165]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Mr. Big operations entail significant dangers.&nbsp; The detailed artificial reality created by the operation is purposively manipulative and can compromise the autonomy and human dignity of the suspect.&nbsp; Moreover, the technique generates a significant risk of false confessions, as an individual who is pressured to confess may do or say anything to please Mr. Big and avoid losing his new life.&nbsp; The technique entangles the target in a web of prejudicial evidence that may undermine trial fairness.&nbsp; Finally, the unrestricted use of this tactic risks abusive state conduct, as the police devote substantial resources to manipulating suspects who are presumed to be innocent.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[166]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Big confessions are not caught by the traditional rules governing confessions to the state, such as the confessions rule or the right to silence.&nbsp; My colleague Moldaver J. would therefore address the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions by creating a new rule of evidence under the common law.&nbsp; Under this rule, Mr. Big confessions are inadmissible unless the Crown establishes that the probative value of the confession (factoring in its reliability) outweighs its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; He would leave concerns about state conduct to the abuse of process doctrine.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[167]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I fear that the proposed common law rule fails to consistently take into account broader concerns that arise when state agents generate a confession at a cost to human dignity, personal autonomy and the administration of justice.&nbsp; These concerns are recognized in our jurisprudence dealing with confessions to the state and lie at the root of the principle against self-incrimination.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[172]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Big operations have procured confessions when traditional investigative techniques have failed.&nbsp; Indeed, that is their sole purpose.&nbsp; These operations, often costly and complex, create elaborate false realities for their targets in which they are valued and rewarded.&nbsp; Threats and inducements are tailored to exploit suspects’ vulnerabilities, and confessing becomes necessary for their new lives to continue.&nbsp; The very structure of Mr. Big operations creates circumstances that (1) compromise the suspects’ autonomy, (2) undermine the reliability of confessions, and (3) raise concerns about abusive state conduct.&nbsp; In addition, Mr. Big operations create prejudicial evidence of criminal propensity which has the potential to compromise accused persons’ ability to make full answer and defence, undermining the fairness of the trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[173]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite these dangers, the Mr. Big technique has not been extensively reviewed by this Court.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. McIntyre</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 480, the Court upheld the admissibility of the Mr. Big statements obtained in that case in a brief oral judgment, finding that “the tricks used by the police were not likely to shock the community” (p.&nbsp;481).&nbsp; But <i>McIntyre</i> was very different from this case:&nbsp; the operation lasted for only 10 days, the police officers posing as criminals immediately revealed the illegal nature of their activities, and the “job” offer they made to McIntyre at the outset required him to prove he was capable of killing (see <i>R. v. McIntyre</i> (1993), 135 N.B.R. (2<sup>e</sup>) 266 (C.A.)).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[174]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Existing safeguards that govern confessions made to the state are rooted in traditional investigative techniques and fail to properly regulate Mr. Big operations.&nbsp; The confessions rule does not apply in a Mr. Big operation because the suspect is not aware that he is speaking to a person in authority (<i>R. v. Hodgson</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at paras. 24-29; <i>R. v. Grandinetti</i>, 2005 SCC 5, [2005] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;27), nor does the right to silence, which arises only upon a suspect’s detention (<i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 184; <i>McIntyre</i>).&nbsp; Thus, Mr. Big confessions fall into the gaps between the traditional rules.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[175]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court cannot countenance this void.&nbsp; The existing rules assist in identifying the interests affected and dangers generated by Mr. Big operations and in structuring a principled and responsive legal framework.&nbsp; The confessions rule guards against unreliable confessions and regulates state conduct to protect basic fairness in the criminal process (<i>R. v. Oickle</i>, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 68-69).&nbsp; The right to silence focuses on autonomy, choice and fairness by protecting detained persons’ “right to choose whether to speak to the authorities or to remain silent” (<i>Hebert</i>,<i> </i>at p. 180).&nbsp; More broadly, the principle against self-incrimination from which these protections stem is based upon respect for an individual’s autonomy and human dignity, which give that individual the right to choose whether to incriminate herself. &nbsp;The principle serves “at least two key purposes, namely to protect against unreliable confessions, and to protect against abuses of power by the state” (<i>R. v. White</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417,<i> </i>at para. 43; see also <i>R. v. Jones</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229,<i> </i>at p.&nbsp;250).</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">[t]he definition of the principle against self-incrimination as an assertion of human freedom is intimately connected to the principle’s underlying rationale.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[189]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach does not identify prejudice as a factor to be considered under the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; However, the prejudice created by the evidence of criminal propensity is indirectly relevant to reliability and state conduct.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial judge retains the residual power to exclude evidence on the basis of trial fairness (see <i>R. v. Harrer</i>,<i> </i>[1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at paras. 24 and 41) or when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>

 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Coercion</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[192]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A confession is coerced when the accused is deprived of a free choice whether to admit, deny, or refuse to answer (<i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> (6th ed. 1990), at p. 258).&nbsp; In the context of a Mr. Big operation, a confession is coerced when the suspect is deprived of any reasonable alternative to confessing.&nbsp; While there will almost always be some degree of coercion in a Mr. Big operation, the issue at this stage is the <i>extent</i> of that constraint.&nbsp; Coercion is not a binary.&nbsp; This means that even if the suspect had some<i> </i>alternative to confessing, the <i>degree</i> to which his free choice was compromised must be examined.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[193]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While threats of violence are manifestly coercive, the principle of autonomy abhors coercion in all its forms.&nbsp; In <i>Rothman v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640,<i> </i>and <i>Oickle</i>, this Court held that particularly manipulative trickery ― for example, a police officer pretending to be a chaplain or a legal aid lawyer to obtain a confession ― would shock the community.&nbsp; A Mr. Big operation is built upon <i>layers</i> of deception.&nbsp; The target is exposed not only to a false confidante, but false friends, a false job, and a false life.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[194]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining the degree of coercion, the court should consider the magnitude and duration of the operation, any explicit or implied threats used, any financial, social, or emotional inducements applied, and the characteristics of the suspect, including any mental, physical, social, or economic disadvantages.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[195]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of example, when financial inducements are offered to a person of means, it will be difficult to argue that he or she had no reasonable choice but to confess.&nbsp; On the much more serious end of the spectrum are operations which exploit individuals’ particular weaknesses, such that they feel obliged to make a self-incriminating statement.&nbsp; Of course, sufficient pressure may cause even well-situated individuals to feel the force of coercion.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[196]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach protects the autonomy of the suspect, a cardinal concern of the confessions rule (where it is also expressed as voluntariness) and the principle against self-incrimination more broadly.&nbsp; In <i>Hodgson</i>,<i> </i>for example, Cory J. (quoting L. Herman, “The Unexplored Relationship Between the Privilege Against Compulsory Self-Incrimination and the Involuntary Confession Rule (Part I)” (1992), 53 <i>Ohio St. L.J.</i> 101, at p. 153, citing Sir G. Gilbert, <i>The Law of Evidence</i> (1769)) noted that the common law “will not force any Man to accuse himself”, and held&nbsp; that “from its very inception, the confessions rule was designed not only to ensure the reliability of the confession, but also to guarantee fundamental fairness in the criminal process” (para. 18 (emphasis deleted)).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[197]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the concern for autonomy interweaves<i> </i>with the goals of obtaining reliable evidence and curbing offensive state conduct, it exists in our adversarial legal system as an idea with its own normative force, namely, “a basic distaste for self-conscription” (<i>R. v. S. (R.J.)</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, at para. 83).&nbsp; As this Court has explained, “proper rules of battle between government and individual require that the individual . . . not be conscripted by his opponent to defeat himself” (<i>White</i>,<i> </i>at para. 42, citing <i>Wigmore on Evidence</i>, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961), §&nbsp;2251, at p. 318).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[198]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>S. (R.J.)</i>, the Court described the principle against self-incrimination as “the principle of sovereignty embodied in the idea that individuals should be left alone in the absence of justification, and not conscripted by the state to promote a self-defeating purpose” (para. 81).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[199]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there will almost always be <i>some</i> degree of coercion in a Mr. Big operation, this does not mean that any resulting confession will automatically be excluded.&nbsp; The police must have leeway to employ the Mr. Big technique up to a certain point.&nbsp; However, if the coercion was so great that the suspect was made to believe that he had no alternative but to confess, the statement will have been obtained unconstitutionally.&nbsp; Barring such extreme cases, the court must weigh the <i>nature and severity </i>of coercion alongside the reliability of any resulting statement and the conduct of the state, two factors I delineate below.</p>
 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reliability</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[200]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>False confessions can cause miscarriages of justice, condemn innocent individuals, and result in failures to convict the truly guilty (<i>Oickle</i>, at para. 32).&nbsp; Concern for reliability rightly underpins numerous protections against self-incrimination.&nbsp; Under the “reliability” analysis, the court will execute a robust gatekeeper function in assessing the risk of a false confession, and corroborating or supporting evidence will usually be a prerequisite to admission.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[201]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appraisal is of paramount importance because juries often struggle to properly assess the ultimate reliability of Mr. Big confessions.&nbsp; Juries generally find it difficult to believe that someone would confess to a crime she did not commit (<i>Oickle</i>, at para. 34), and are loath to disregard a confession even where it is known to be coerced (S. M. Kassin et al., “Police-Induced Confessions:&nbsp; Risk Factors and Recommendations” (2010), 34 <i>Law &amp; Hum. Behav</i>. 3, at p. 24).&nbsp; This danger is compounded by the criminal propensity evidence generated during a Mr. Big investigation.&nbsp; An accused who falsely confessed is in a catch-22 situation; his only course to explain away his statement is to admit that it was made to preserve his criminal lifestyle.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[202]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the trial judge must play a gatekeeper role in assessing the reliability of the confession.&nbsp; Although the assessment of <i>ultimate</i> reliability ― the final weight to be given to the confession ― is the purview of the jury, a gatekeeping function is far from unprecedented.&nbsp; For example, trial judges are called upon to gauge the threshold reliability of hearsay evidence.&nbsp; In doing so, the judge may find evidence sufficiently trustworthy either because the circumstances of the statement are indicative of reliability or because the jury will have the tools to assess it (<i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at paras. 62-63; <i>R. v. Youvarajah</i>, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at paras. 29-30).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[203]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, traditional indicia of reliability often cannot be relied upon in a Mr. Big operation.&nbsp; The confession of an accused is generally considered to be admissible hearsay, in part because it is a<i> </i>“statement against interest” and therefore more likely to be reliable.&nbsp; But statements to Mr. Big are not “against” the accused’s interest at all:&nbsp; the target has been made to feel safe from legal consequences, and confessing is a precondition to membership in the organization, access to work, or some other benefit.&nbsp; Confessions are also treated as admissible hearsay because the accused, a party to the case, can testify that the confession was false (see <i>R. v. Osm</i><i>ar</i>, 2007<i> </i>ONCA 50, 84 O.R. (3d) 321, leave to appeal refused, [2007] 2 S.C.R. vii; <i>R. v. Bon</i><i>isteel</i>, 2008 BCCA 344, 259 B.C.A.C. 114).&nbsp; However, by design, the Mr. Big operation creates prejudicial evidence of criminal propensity.&nbsp; The accused must either let the confession stand or explain that he made it in order to continue his new criminal lifestyle.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[204]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, confessions made to Mr. Big are particularly hazardous, and the judge must evaluate their threshold reliability in order to satisfy the principle against self-incrimination.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[205]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to find that a confession was constitutionally obtained, supporting evidence will usually be required<i>.</i>&nbsp; Under the confessions rule, corroborative evidence cannot salvage an involuntary statement.&nbsp; That rule is not concerned with the reliability of the particular confession, but with the manner in which it was obtained.&nbsp; This is because “if the state were left with the option of simply corroborating forced confessions, there would be little incentive to refrain from reprehensible investigative measures” (<i>Hodgson</i>,<i> </i>at para. 20).&nbsp; However, under the self-incrimination framework, coercion and state conduct are independently considered under other factors, so there is no need to use reliability as a proxy for these concerns, and corroborative evidence may be considered.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[206]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, corroborative evidence compensates for the reliability concerns inherent to a Mr. Big operation.&nbsp; Such tactics involve powerful inducements:&nbsp; <span style="line-height:200%">the suspect is promised financial </span><span style="line-height:200%">rewards, membership in an organization</span><span style="line-height:200%">, </span><span style="line-height:200%">le</span><span style="line-height:200%">gal protection, approval and friendship, or some combination of these in exchange for simply admitting to the commission of the crime.&nbsp; At the same time, the suspect has usually </span><span style="line-height:200%">been </span><span style="line-height:200%">warned about the </span><span style="line-height:200%">consequences of failing to behave as the organization expects, and the “truth” that Mr. Big wants to hear has already been made very clear.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[207]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A confession is more likely to be reliable if it leads to the discovery of details of the crime scene, describes unusual aspects of the crime, or refers to “hold back” evidence ― provided, of course, such details or evidence could not be guessed or otherwise identified by the suspect.&nbsp; I agree with <i>amicus curiae</i> that, generally, an uncorroborated, unverified confession will not be sufficiently reliable and will be inadmissible.&nbsp; However, the inverse does not necessarily hold.&nbsp; The principle against self-incrimination is not solely concerned with ensuring reliable statements; even true statements may be excluded if they were obtained through abusive state conduct or through coercion that overrode the suspect’s autonomy interest.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[208]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not to say that Mr. Big confessions will always be inadmissible.&nbsp; When the police elicit confessions in a way that respects the autonomy of the suspect and the integrity of the administration of justice ― likely through shorter, less exploitative Mr. Big investigations like that in <i>McIntyre</i> ― the resulting confessions will be less grievously afflicted with reliability concerns and will more likely be admissible, particularly when corroborated.</p>

Mack</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, establishes that, unless the authorities have a reasonable suspicion that a suspect is already engaged in criminal activity, or act pursuant to a <i>bona fide</i> inquiry, they cannot provide the suspect with an opportunity to commit an offence.&nbsp; Even when that threshold for suspicion is met, the authorities cannot go beyond <i>providing an opportunity</i> to commit an offence by crossing over into <i>inducing commission</i> of the offence (<i>Mack</i>, at p. 964).&nbsp; Lamer J. provided a useful non-exhaustive list of factors to consider in determining whether that line has been crossed.&nbsp; In the Mr. Big context, these kinds of factors can assist in deciding whether the inducements, threats, and manipulation used constitute abusive state conduct.&nbsp; Adapting the factors from <i>Mack</i>,<i> </i>at p. 966, the following considerations are relevant to Mr. Big operations:</p>

 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Weighing the Contextual Factors</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[215]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">As I have explained, the foregoing contextual factors are not binaries that are “present” or “not present”.&nbsp; In most cases, there will be some degree of concern about coercion, about the reliability of the confession, and about the state conduct. </span><span style="line-height:200%">This does not automatically mean the statement should be excluded.&nbsp; The court should consider the concerns collectively, attaching weight to them, depending on the degree to which they are present in the individual case.&nbsp; For example, if a confession is corroborated and reliable, this factor may outweigh relatively minor concerns about coercive conduct.&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">In some cases ― if the statements were obtained in a highly coercive manner or the state conduct cannot be condoned by the courts ― the principle against self-incrimination may be violated even if the statement is reliable.&nbsp; Except in such extreme cases, </span><span style="line-height:200%">it is the collective, rather than individual, impact of these concerns that will determine whether the principle against self-incrimination has been violated.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[216]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Typical undercover operations, therefore, will not violate the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; Unlike Mr. Big operations, these strategies are not designed around the coercive use of threats and inducements or entrapment-like state conduct.&nbsp; Undercover officers usually role-play within existing circumstances to observe suspects and <i>gather</i> evidence ― not to <i>generate</i> confessions ― resulting in reduced concerns with respect to both autonomy interests and the reliability of the evidence obtained.&nbsp; By contrast, the very structure of Mr. Big operations is coercive ― officers deliberately set out to enmesh the suspect in a criminal organization and drive him or her towards a confession.&nbsp; In the usual undercover context, police must be careful to avoid entrapping suspects into committing the crimes for which they are being investigated.&nbsp; Thus, by design, such an operation must guard against abusive entrapment police conduct that is typical in a Mr. Big operation.&nbsp; It is therefore highly unlikely that in classic undercover operations, concerns about personal autonomy, reliability, and abusive conduct ― even when weighed together ― will result in a violation of the principle against self-incrimination.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[218]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, even as modified by my colleague, this rule is not sufficient to respond to the dangers of a confession to Mr. Big because it does not protect the human dignity and autonomy of the suspect or temper state conduct.&nbsp; Under my colleague’s approach, a highly reliable confession will likely be admitted ― regardless of whether the target was coerced by the state to incriminate himself.&nbsp; His rule does not permit these concerns to be assessed and considered collectively under a single principled framework.&nbsp; It is preferable for the reliability of a confession and the manner in which it was obtained to be considered together.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[219]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague’s rule, including the presumption of inadmissibility, only applies if the police employ a Mr. Big investigation.&nbsp; As such, it may inspire a threshold debate about the boundaries of the Mr. Big tactic.&nbsp; By contrast, an approach that responds to the <i>dangers</i> of state-induced confessions applies regardless of the label attached to the tactic.&nbsp; It is the threats to which the rule responds that call it to action.</p>

It was made clear to him that his friendships, his wages, and his membership in the organization (essentially his new family) were dependent on telling Mr. Big what he wanted to hear.&nbsp; In short, he had every incentive to confess, whether he committed the crime or not.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he protested his innocence until it was apparent that only a confession would be accepted.&nbsp; Hart testified at the <i>voir dire</i> that the boss “kept saying, don’t lie to me, you are lying to me Nelson, don’t lie to me.&nbsp; What was I suppose[d] to do, stay there all day and go on like that[?]”</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[231]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the state conduct in this case was egregious, and this factor weighs heavily in favour of exclusion.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[232]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police led Mr. Hart through the looking glass into a parallel universe where, for many months, they employed extensive state resources to prey on his lack of education, intellect, and life experience, his social isolation, and his extreme poverty.&nbsp; The undercover operatives fostered the respondent’s emotional dependency on them; as Jim noted, it was a “constant thing” for Hart to tell them he loved them.&nbsp; Mr. Hart’s beloved friends gradually involved him in an increasingly serious world of criminality, beginning with dealing in supposedly stolen goods and eventually portraying the organization as a violent international group with a boss who made the Hell’s Angels look like “flunkies”.&nbsp; As Hart involved himself in more dangerous and illegal activity, his pay increased.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[233]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The degree of harm caused by the Mr. Big operation is also relevant.&nbsp; The respondent was so thoroughly enmeshed in his make-believe<i> </i>world that upon his arrest, his first reaction was to call his supposed “friend”, Jim.&nbsp; It should have come as no surprise, particularly to the officers who knew him so well, that Hart was devastated to learn that his new life, where he had felt valued and respected, had all been a carefully constructed illusion.&nbsp; He had no friends.&nbsp; He had not been employed because he was “smart”:&nbsp; rather, he was thoroughly duped.&nbsp; The respondent developed paranoia, believing that everyone was part of the “sting” against him, and was unable to trust his lawyers and even his own wife.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[12]</span></span></a>&nbsp; He was eventually committed to a psychiatric hospital, and <i>amicus curiae </i>made submissions on his behalf at the appeal.&nbsp; Such an emotional collapse is by no means a prerequisite to a finding of abusive state conduct.&nbsp; However, this kind of psychological manipulation by state agents harms not only the suspect but the integrity of the justice system.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[234]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was not the usual undercover investigation where police join an existing criminal organization in order to witness criminals in action.&nbsp; As explained above, such strategies tend not to be particularly coercive or abusive, and therefore are unlikely to violate the principle against self-incrimination.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[235]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case is more akin to entrapment.&nbsp; The police employed the power of the state to create an elaborate invented reality, designed to exploit a vulnerable person, introduce him to criminality, and force him to incriminate himself. &nbsp;In addition, the police witnessed the respondent suffering seizures both before the investigation began and during the operation itself.&nbsp; Yet, the undercover operatives continued to send him on driving assignments.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[236]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Big operations are a creative and sometimes useful law enforcement technique, but the courts must carefully police their boundaries lest they stray from being useful strategies into ploys that allow the state to manipulate and destroy the lives of individuals who are presumed to be innocent.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[237]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am greatly troubled by the extreme lengths to which the police went to pursue the respondent, exploiting his weaknesses in this protracted and deeply manipulative operation.&nbsp; The abuse of process doctrine always remains independently available to provide a remedy where the conduct of the state rises to such a level that it risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process (<i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 73; <i>R. v. Babos</i>, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 31).&nbsp; In my view, as will be clear from my discussion of the state conduct in this case, that threshold is met.&nbsp; To condone the actions of the police would “leave the impression that the justice system condones conduct that offends society’s sense of fair play and decency” (<i>Babos</i>,<i> </i>at para. 35).&nbsp; However, given the outcome of this appeal, it is not necessary to discuss this issue further.</p>
