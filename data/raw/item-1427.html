 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The sole task of a jury is to reach a verdict based exclusively on the evidence presented.&nbsp; The sturdy independence of jurors may be overcome and unanimity compelled by a judge’s suggesting&nbsp; irrelevant factors for consideration or by a judge’s&nbsp; exerting unwarranted pressure.&nbsp; In those circumstances, the verdict may no longer be based on a reasoned approach to the evidence.&nbsp; The exhortation given to an apparently deadlocked jury must therefore be delicately balanced and carefully crafted and must encourage the jurors to endeavour to reach a verdict by reasoning together.&nbsp; The purpose of the exhortation is to assist the process of deliberation, not to influence the content of the jury’s discussion.&nbsp; To suggest that a deadlocked jury take into account factors such as the expense, and the inconvenience occasioned by a new trial, or the hardship caused to the participants when a trial is left unresolved, or to consider carefully only the position of the majority and not the minority, introduces pressures and factors which are completely irrelevant to the jurors’ duties and therefore inappropriate in an exhortation.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The following principles can be derived from the jurisprudence.&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;Pursuant to their oath, jurors must endeavour to render a verdict based upon the evidence which has been adduced before them.&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;The strength and genius of trial by jury is that members of the community reason together to reach a verdict based solely upon the evidence.&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;A jury must therefore be allowed to deliberate without any form of pressure being imposed upon them.&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;If a jury has apparently reached an impasse, any exhortation should avoid introducing factors which are extraneous and irrelevant to the task of reaching a verdict, and should not encourage a juror, by referring to these factors, to abandon an honestly held view of the evidence.&nbsp; The exhortation must not interfere with the right of jurors to deliberate in complete freedom uninfluenced by extraneous pressure.&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;A juror should not be encouraged or exhorted to change his or her mind simply for the sake of conformity.&nbsp; (6) A deadline for reaching a verdict should not be imposed and a jury should never be rushed into returning a verdict.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The reference to expense and inconvenience should not have been referred to in the exhortation.&nbsp; It introduced an irrelevant, extraneous factor into the jury’s deliberations and was coercive in that it would make the minority feel that they had to agree with the majority.&nbsp; This factor is a significant one and would influence a juror to disregard the oath and arrive at a verdict based on factors other than the evidence produced during the trial.&nbsp; The error&nbsp; could not be cured and&nbsp; was sufficient in itself to warrant a new trial.&nbsp; Other aspects of this exhortation lead to the same result.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The reference to a possible benefit accruing to the accused and witnesses if a verdict could be reached has been correctly disapproved.&nbsp; With respect to the complainant, such a reference may encourage what could be an inappropriate sympathetic influence into the reasoning process of the jurors, particularly at this stage of the proceedings.&nbsp; With regard to the accused, the reference may be misleading since a guilty verdict as a result of the exhortation is&nbsp; not in the accused’s best interest.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The mere suggestion that a juror should listen to fellow jurors may not be, in itself, improper.&nbsp; No suggestion should be made, however, that&nbsp; a juror should abandon his or her honestly held view in favour of the majority position.&nbsp; Such a direction could well be construed as an encouragement to the dissentient minority to fall in with the majority while continuing to disagree with their views.&nbsp; A trial judge would better avoid putting the situation in confrontational terms of opposing sides and instead&nbsp; appeal to the individual jurors to once again reason together.&nbsp; Any such a suggestion must state that both sides should listen to each other and consider the opinions of others.</span></p>

Littlejohn</i> (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 161<i> </i>(Ont. C.A.))<i>.</i>&nbsp; There is no better person to assess what should be stated in an exhortation than a trial judge.&nbsp; It is he or she who has been with the trial since its inception and is able to gauge the mood and tenor of the particular jury.&nbsp; In my view, an exhortation should be treated by appellate courts in a manner similar to the way charges to the jury are currently reviewed.&nbsp; While few exhortations will be perfect, appellate courts should refrain from interfering unless there has been a clear error which brings the validity of the verdict into question: <i>R. v. Robinson</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 683;&nbsp; <i>R. v.

Littlejohn, supra</i>, at p. 168, that in determining whether an exhortation was coercive, “the entire sequence of events leading up to the direction which is assailed, must be considered”.&nbsp; I would merely add that in making this assessment we should consider the effect of the <u>entire</u> exhortation, and not unduly isolate or highlight one particular reference; see <i>R. v. Halliday</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Man. C.A.), at p. 494, <i>per</i> Scott C.J., regarding this approach.</span></p>

On several occasions, the same courts cited by Cory J. have stated that a mention of public expense, while best avoided, cannot be said to have coerced the jury or caused any prejudice to the accused: <i>Watson&nbsp; </i>(1988), 87 Cr. App. R. 1 (C.A.), at p. 7; <i>&nbsp;Buono</i> (1992), 95 Cr. App. R. 338 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Tennant</i>, [1989] 2 N.Z.L.R. 271 (C.A.), at p. 276; <i>R. v. Isaac</i> (1979), 48 C.C.C.

In <i>R. v. Jackson</i>, unreported, (C.A., Crim. Div. (Eng.), March 9, 1988), this theory was clearly refuted.&nbsp; At trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict 10 minutes after an exhortation which included a reference to “a lot of waste of time and a lot of expense”.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the court denied the appeal, stating:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">We take the view that any possible pressure which might have been imposed upon the jury by the Recorder mentioning waste of time and expense was cured by his emphasising immediately afterwards that the jury’s primary consideration must be to bring in a verdict according to their oath.&nbsp; Accordingly, despite the short length of their retirement after that direction, we do not think there was any material irregularity which obliges us to allow the appeal.&nbsp; The appeal is accordingly dismissed.</span></p>

Clearly, there are different&nbsp; degrees of these types of errors and not everyone should be approached in exactly the same way.&nbsp; The preeminent concern is the perceived effect of the error, which can be analyzed&nbsp; by examining a number of factors including, <i>inter alia</i>, the prominence of the reference, whether it was repeated, and whether other comments might have cured any harmful effect.&nbsp; I will return to this during the discussion of the proper standard of review. </span></p>

This is&nbsp; a factor which is mentioned or implied at several points during the trial process.&nbsp; Like the New Zealand Court of Appeal, I am of the view that a reference to it during the exhortation is in most cases quite harmless.</p>

He did so not once, but twice, and coupled this with a reminder that the jury need not agree.&nbsp; The words of Bull J.A. regarding a similar situation in <i>Palmer, supra</i>, at p. 415, are apposite:</p>
