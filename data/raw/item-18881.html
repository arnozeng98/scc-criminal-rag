 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When P was 15, he went to a party at a beach to celebrate a friend’s birthday with a group of young <span class="CitationCar"><span style="color:windowtext;
font-style:normal">people</span></span>. The complainant, D, was 14. They had both been drinking. Sexual intercourse took place. P was charged with sexually assaulting D. The Crown’s position at trial was that P had sex with D when he knew she was too drunk to be capable of consenting. P’s defence was that D consented to having sex with him before there were any signs that she was too drunk to consent. One of D’s friends, G, came to the party later than the rest of the group. She saw D lying on the ground and went to her right away. D had been vomiting, could not get up, and was incapable of communicating. There was no dispute that D was intoxicated to the point of incapacity when G found her. The question was how soon after the sexual activity took place did G see D. The trial judge rejected P’s evidence in chief that he spoke with G before G attended to D, but accepted P’s evidence that he heard G arrive at the party right after he finished having sex with D, and his admission in cross-examination that G went directly to D when she arrived, which aligned with G’s evidence. The trial judge concluded that D was in an incapacitated state at the time of intercourse and therefore incapable of consenting at that time. The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that P knew or was reckless or wilfully blind to the fact that D was so intoxicated that she could not have consented to sexual activity. She found P guilty of sexual assault.</p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">(1)&nbsp;<i>Unreasonableness of the Verdict</i></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>Abella, Karakatsanis and Martin&nbsp;JJ.: The verdict was reasonable. The trial judge’s reasons for finding P guilty of sexual assault are model trial reasons: rigorous and thoughtfully explained. There is no basis for finding the verdict to be unreasonable.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A verdict reached by a judge may be unreasonable, even if supported by the evidence, if it is reached illogically or irrationally. This may occur if the trial judge draws an inference or makes a finding of fact essential to the verdict that is plainly contradicted by the evidence relied on by the judge in support of that inference or finding, or shown to be incompatible with evidence that has neither been contradicted by other evidence nor rejected by the trial judge. The inquiry is narrowly targeted at fundamental flaws in the reasoning process which means that the verdict was not reached judicially or in accordance with the rule of law.<s> </s></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the reasoning that led the trial judge to conclude that G discovered D in her incapacitated state right after the intercourse was both logical and rational. The trial judge rejected P’s evidence that he spoke with G before she attended to D because it was internally inconsistent with his own evidence on cross-examination, externally contradicted by the evidence of G, and<i> </i>because P was intoxicated, particularly in comparison to G, whose memory was not suspect. The trial judge provided sound reasons for what she believed and what she did not, explaining why she found that some of P’s evidence did not suffer from the same flaws that led her to reject other aspects of his testimony. The verdict was clearly one that a properly instructed judge acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. The trial judge was well aware that the time of intercourse could not be ascertained in absolute terms, and that what mattered was the relative time of G’s arrival in relation to the sexual activity. The combination of G’s evidence and P’s evidence satisfied the trial judge that G went to D as soon as she arrived, and that, on P’s own evidence, G’s arrival at the party was right after intercourse had taken place. This entitled the trial judge logically to conclude that the totally incapacitated condition G found D in when she arrived was the condition she was in during the sexual activity.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>Wagner<b>&nbsp;</b>C.J. and Moldaver, Brown and Rowe&nbsp;JJ.: There is agreement with Abella&nbsp;J. that the verdict was reasonable.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>Kasirer&nbsp;J.: There is agreement with Abella&nbsp;J. that the verdict was reasonable.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><i><span style="line-height:
200%">Per</span></i><span style="line-height:200%"> Côté&nbsp;J. (dissenting): P’s conviction for sexual assault is unreasonable. First, the trial judge’s finding of D’s incapacity to consent to sexual intercourse was reached illogically. The trial judge was well aware that the timing of the intercourse was the central issue of the case. The combination of the evidence of P and D’s friend, G, was </span>crucial<span style="line-height:200%"> to the trial judge’s finding of incapacity. G’s evidence alone was insufficient to support a finding of incapacity at the time of the intercourse and additional evidence was necessary to narrow the gap between the time of the intercourse and the time when G went to see D. It was only P’s evidence that could address the timing of the intercourse in relation to G’s arrival and her observation of D. The trial judge bridged that gap by rejecting the evidence that P spoke with G before she tended to D for three reasons: (1)&nbsp;P contradicted himself; (2)&nbsp;G was more reliable and credible; and (3)&nbsp;P’s evidence was unreliable because he was intoxicated at this point in the evening. It was open to the trial judge to reject certain portions of P’s evidence due to internal and external contradictions provided that the trial judge had a logical and reasonable basis for doing so. However, here, the source of the trial judge’s illogical reasoning stems from her third reason. It was illogical for the trial judge to find, on the one hand, that P could not testify reliably about what had happened after the intercourse because he had been too intoxicated at that point in the night, while also finding, on the other hand, that P could nevertheless testify reliably about the fact that he had heard when G had arrived at the party. These findings are irreconcilable. If P was too intoxicated at that time to be subsequently able to testify reliably about the conversation, his testimony about having heard G arriving was also necessarily unreliable. These two events would have occurred at the same point in time, that is, at a time when, in the trial judge’s view, P had been too drunk for his subsequent testimony to be reliable. The trial judge found that P had been too drunk at that time to subsequently remember some things yet not too drunk to subsequently remember other things that would have happened at the same time. The trial judge gave no reason to explain this inconsistency on a crucial piece of evidence. Without P’s evidence that he heard G arriving after the intercourse, it was impossible to convict P of sexual assault. This logical flaw would suffice to order a new trial.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the evidence available to the trial judge is not capable of supporting the finding of D’s incapacity to consent and a verdict of acquittal should be entered instead of ordering a new trial. The trial judge should have accorded far less weight </span>to<span style="line-height:200%"> P’s evidence about the timing of the intercourse in relation to G’s arrival than she did in her reasons. The trial judge attached significant weight to P’s evidence that he had heard about G arriving shortly after the intercourse. It constituted the centerpiece of her reasons. This was, however, incompatible with her repeated findings to the effect that P had been quite intoxicated and was thus an unreliable witness. Once the reliability of P’s testimony is approached coherently with the trial judge’s repeated findings to the effect that he had been quite intoxicated and that his memory of the crucial events was unreliable, it is simply impossible to pinpoint, even roughly, the time when the intercourse occurred on the basis of the rest of the circumstantial evidence. A reconstruction of the timeline indicates that the intercourse may have occurred at any time during a window of roughly two hours. As a result, the evidence did not permit the time of the intercourse to be determined beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge could not reasonably conclude that D’s being incapable of consenting at the time of the intercourse was the only reasonable finding available on the evidence. Without the finding of incapacity, there was no case against P, because neither D nor any other witness had testified that D had not consented as a matter of fact. Consequently, the evidence is not capable of supporting the verdict that P is guilty of sexual assault, and an acquittal should be entered in its place. </span></p>

Here, the requirements of the first step are satisfied, as a limit on young persons’ right to appeal to the Court engages residual liberty interests under s.&nbsp;7. The outcome hinges on whether this deprivation is in accordance with the proposed new principle of fundamental justice that young persons are entitled to enhanced procedural protections in the criminal justice system. For a principle of justice to be “fundamental” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;7: (i)&nbsp;it must be a legal principle; (ii)&nbsp;there must be a consensus that the rule or principle is fundamental to the way in which the legal system ought fairly to operate; and (iii)&nbsp;it must be identified with sufficient precision to yield a manageable standard against which to measure deprivations of life, liberty or security of the person.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this proposed new principle entails a comparative assessment of procedural rights of young persons and those of adults, then it yields neither a meaningful standard nor one upon which any consensus is conceivable. If it is construed as a freestanding principle, the s.&nbsp;7 argument depends on whether s.&nbsp;37(10) deprives young persons of a liberty interest without adequate procedural safeguards. Denying young persons an automatic right to a hearing in the Court where a court of appeal affirms a conviction for an indictable offence, but a judge of that court dissents on a question of law, cannot in itself contravene their constitutional entitlement to adequate procedural protection in the youth criminal justice system because there is no constitutional right to an appeal, let alone an automatic one at the apex of the judicial system. The principles of fundamental justice could not require an automatic hearing in the Court in such narrow circumstances as this would have the effect of constitutionalizing the application of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec691subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;691(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>to young persons, thereby implying that Parliament would be under a positive obligation to enact such a provision if one did not already exist. Automatic appeals for young persons are not a foundational requirement for the dispensation of justice. The absence of an automatic appeal does not increase the likelihood of wrongful convictions or other miscarriages of justice. The dearth of evidence that there is an actual problem with the way the Court has been exercising its discretion to grant leave belies the conclusion that s.&nbsp;37(10) denies young persons adequate procedural safeguards.

Section 37(10) does not perpetuate any disadvantage but, rather, appropriately balances the overlapping interests of young persons in prompt resolution and in appellate review. Above all, the leave requirement in s.&nbsp;37(10) applies equally to the Crown and confers the corollary procedural benefit for young persons of being protected from an as of right appeal by the Crown pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec693subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;693(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, a safeguard that is not afforded to adults.</p>

That party must demonstrate a pressing and substantial objective for the limit and that the means chosen to advance this objective do not disproportionately limit the s.&nbsp;15(1) right. Proportionality demands that the limit be rationally connected to the stated pressing and substantial objective, that it be minimally impairing, and that its benefits outweigh its negative effects. The relationship between s.&nbsp;15(1) and s.&nbsp;1 requires careful attention. The focus of the inquiry must be on the seriousness of the discrimination and its relationship with the underlying values in a free and democratic society. A limit on s.&nbsp;15(1) rights based on a person’s age has been viewed in some contexts as less serious and thus more easily justified. The analysis must be attentive to the context of the legislative objectives at issue. The pressing and substantial objective must be scrutinized so that state conduct resulting in the most odious forms of discrimination is not excused. This does not preclude limits that promote other values and principles.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the constitutional question before the Court is particularized to the s.&nbsp;691(1)(a) appeal route, it is this narrow instance of <i>prima facie</i> age discrimination that the Crown must justify. <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">Section 37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>has a pressing and substantial objective of promoting timeliness, early rehabilitation and reintegration in youth criminal matters, which the youth criminal justice system is designed, in part, to promote. Providing for appeals by leave instead of by right favours early resolution of matters involving youth. Timeliness reinforces the connection between the actions and consequences, reduces psychological impact, avoids a sense of potential unfairness, and advances societal interest in seeing young persons rehabilitated and reintegrated into society as swiftly as possible.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp;37(10) is rationally connected to the pressing and substantial objective of timeliness, early rehabilitation, and reintegration. By requiring leave in those circumstances where there would otherwise be appeals as of right, s.&nbsp;37(10) serves the goal of timeliness as the leave requirement may be a disincentive to bringing an unmeritorious appeal. Moreover, leave applications are generally decided more quickly than appeals. While the appeal process may be longer on average for those young persons who are successful in their leave applications to the Court as compared to a scenario in which there was no leave requirement, this does not preclude a finding that s.&nbsp;37(10) is rationally connected to the legislative objective, since it is designed to bring a rapid conclusion to those cases where there is no reason to hear the appeal which raises a question of law that is without merit.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to minimal impairment, Parliament’s imposition of a leave requirement in s.&nbsp;37(10) does not go too far to achieve its objective of timeliness, early rehabilitation, and reintegration in youth criminal matters. While imposing a leave requirement on an otherwise meritorious appeal could raise a potential for miscarriage of justice that is not present in the case of adults who have an appeal as of right, the Court exercises its leave power in a manner that allows it to hear appeals in cases raising a potential miscarriage of justice. In criminal matters, the concept of public importance, the most important criterion for determining the success or failure of a leave application, is best understood as being engaged not only by jurisprudentially important legal issues that qualify as issues of public importance on that basis, but also by those that raise serious questions of law about the safety of the verdict in criminal matters. The issue of a wrongful conviction transcends the particular defendant and engages the integrity of our system of justice as a whole. The Court has the institutional capacity to identify possible miscarriages of justice through the leave to appeal process. Not only does it have the ability to exercise its power to grant leave mindful of <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> rights and the fundamental principles of justice, but it has a responsibility to do so. It follows that the leave process provides an effective safeguard for young persons in those cases where a similarly situated adult would have an appeal as of right under s.&nbsp;691(1)(a).</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the benefit in s.&nbsp;37(10) of the timely conclusion of youth criminal matters outweighs the negative effect of the discriminatory impact of imposing a leave requirement for young persons in circumstances where adults can appeal as of right. In enacting <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, Parliament did not choose to take away a young person’s access to the Court, it only added a leave requirement. When deciding the leave application, the Court will have the benefit of the reasons offered in the dissent below on the question of law, the argument in support of leave and the required supporting materials. Most importantly, the criteria for granting leave as relevant to youth criminal matters means that when the liberty of the young person is at stake, a <i>prima facie</i> meritorious appeal on the question of law would meet the public importance standard even if the matter does not transcend in jurisprudential importance the interest of the parties. Any enhanced risk of miscarriage of justice as a result of having to seek leave to appeal in these circumstances is minimized by the leave to appeal process. Imposing a leave requirement in service of the broader goals of youth criminal justice is consistent with the place of equality in a free and democratic society.</p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prove a <i>prima facie </i>violation of s.&nbsp;15(1), a claimant must demonstrate that the impugned law, on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds; and imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage. Substantive equality requires attention to the full context of the claimant group’s situation and to the impact of the limitation on that situation. But context must not be confused with justification. Neither stage of the s.&nbsp;15(1) test permits the objectives of the legislation to infuse the analysis into whether the limitation itself is a distinction that has the effect of perpetuating, reinforcing, or exacerbating the disadvantage of the claimant group. Only at the s. 1 justificatory stage are the statutory objectives relevant, and then only to the extent that they justify the limitation.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the parties acknowledge that the first step of the s.&nbsp;15(1) test is satisfied because there is a distinction between the appeal rights to the Court available to adults and young people on the basis of age. The second step, determining whether depriving young people of the automatic rights to appeal that adults have reinforces, perpetuates or exacerbates their disadvantage, requires consideration of what benefit an automatic right to appeal to the Court provides.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal object of an appeal as of right to the Court in a criminal case is to rectify legal errors in the trial of serious offences. A dissent on a question of law in a provincial court of appeal, including an unreasonable conviction, or one that cannot be supported by the evidence, automatically triggers a right of appeal to the Court in order to guard against miscarriages of justice. Robust procedural protections against wrongful convictions are crucial. The history of wrongful convictions such as those of Steven Truscott, David Milgaard and Donald Marshall Jr. are evidence of the unconscionable consequences of their absence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an access to justice issue of fundamental importance to young people seeking to prevent wrongful convictions. The automatic appeal right available to adults under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec691subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;691(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> is premised on the understanding that a dissent on a question of law at the court of appeal raises a legitimate question as to the validity of the conviction, necessitating final review by the Court regardless of whether the case would otherwise meet the Court’s standard for leave to appeal. Likewise, s.&nbsp;691(2)(b) is an expression of the basic concept that it is essential to a fair criminal justice system that anyone convicted of an indictable offence is entitled to at least one appeal from the initial finding of guilt, whether that finding is first entered at trial or on appeal. These automatic appeal rights provide an automatic additional layer of judicial scrutiny and they offer a significant procedural safeguard.</p>

This deprivation demonstrably perpetuates young people’s disadvantage within the criminal justice system. It is a holdover from an antiquated and paternalistic model of youth justice. It would be untenable to suggest that young persons are less worthy of protection from miscarriages of justice than adults. The very philosophy and purpose of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, with its emphasis on providing substantial procedural protections for young persons, argues for procedures to prevent the ultimate disadvantage, namely, a wrongful conviction. While the Court strives to detect any sign that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred at the leave to appeal stage, an application for leave to appeal does not involve a screening for error in the level of depth that characterizes an appeal on the merits. The objective of timeliness is not a justification for denying access to a procedural protection that has historically served to guard against miscarriages of justice. There is no justification for a speedy resolution if the resolution is based on an unfair trial. There is therefore a <i>prima facie </i>breach of s.&nbsp;15.</p>

Promoting timeliness, early rehabilitation and reintegration are salutary goals, but s.&nbsp;37(10)’s actual contribution to achieving them is minimal. The most that will be saved is a few months in those cases where leave is denied. On the other hand, requiring a young accused person to go through the leave to appeal process before they are entitled to a hearing has the effect of prolonging the process, since if leave is granted, the appeal will not be heard for several more months. This means that s.&nbsp;37(10) exposes young people to a greater risk of miscarriages of justice in aid of the possibility of saving a few months of time. Denying young people the automatic full scrutiny of an appeal and accepting a less rigorous appeal process makes justice the servant of expedition for young people, rather than the other way around. The objectives of timeliness, rehabilitation and reintegration are meaningless if wrongful findings of guilt are tolerated in the service of speed.

The profoundly harmful impact of fast-tracking rehabilitation and reintegration over the right to have the basic procedural appeal protection from miscarriages of justice as adults far outweighs the benefit of the potential shaving of a few months off the appeal process.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:42.55pt;text-indent:-35.45pt">•<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appeals prolong the process, and young people need a speedy resolution to criminal proceedings.&nbsp;Under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, timeliness is a key objective so that young persons found guilty can be quickly rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:42.55pt;text-indent:-35.45pt">•<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the overall purpose of the legislation is ameliorative is of no relevance in determining whether a particular limitation represents a <i>prima facie</i> breach of s.&nbsp;15.

She said that she came to the party with a friend later than the rest of the group. The very first thing she saw was R.D. lying on the ground. She went to her right away. She found R.D. extremely intoxicated. She had been vomiting, could not get up, and was incapable of communicating. In her oral evidence, E.G. reiterated that she immediately went to R.D. when she arrived at the party. E.G.’s evidence on this point was not challenged.</p>

R.D. walked away from the bonfire by herself and sat by some rocks away from the group. C.P. talked to another friend for about five minutes, then returned to R.D. C.P. testified that he and R.D. started kissing, and that at one point she said “Fuck me”. He said he was surprised at first, but he believed her and thought she was able to give consent. He did not use protection.</p>

On these points, she found that C.P. was “evasive and rattled” and “trying to downplay the impact of his drunken state on his ability to remember what happened and on his actions that evening”. C.P.’s demeanour, based on his tone, manner and language, suggested to her that he was guessing about certain answers, and that at other times, he “desperately wanted it to be the case that something had happened, but in fact, it had not”. She was aware, however, that C.P. was</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">remembering an event from a year ago. C.P. is also only 16 years old and I suspect, was nervous when testifying, especially under the skilled cross-examination of counsel. I am, by no means, criticizing his evidence in its entirety. What I have set out above are the many reasons upon which I rejected his evidence on certain, key points. [para. 114]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par17">17</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that R.D. was intoxicated to the point of incapacity when E.G. found her. The question, therefore, was how soon after the sexual activity took place did E.G. see R.D. Based on C.P.’s evidence that he heard E.G. arrive right after the intercourse and the evidence from E.G. and C.P. that E.G. went directly to R.D. when she arrived, the trial judge concluded that R.D. was in an incapacitated state at the time of intercourse:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">This evidence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. leads me to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that R.D. was extremely intoxicated at the time C.P. admitted to being with her and admitted to having sex with her. E.G. found R.D. having already vomited.

She made three key findings. First, she expressly found that “[R.D.] did not ask C.P. to ‘fuck me’”. Second, she concluded that there was “no room to doubt [C.P.’s] knowledge of how drunk” R.D. was when sexual intercourse took place:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. within a very short period of time of the sexual activity, R.D. was falling asleep, had vomit on her, did not appear to be comprehending what E.G. [her friend] was saying and was unable to meaningfully respond. In his testimony, C.P. put himself with R.D. during this time period. There is simply no room to doubt his knowledge of how drunk R.D. really was at the relevant time. [para. 120]</p>

While he knew there was “a need for some inquiry”, he “did not wish to pursue the truth — he preferred to remain ignorant”.</p>

MacPherson J.A., writing for the majority, dismissed C.P.’s appeal (2019 ONCA 85, 373 C.C.C. (3d) 244). He found that “the trial judge’s careful and comprehensive reasons led to an entirely reasonable verdict”. In his view, the trial judge did not commit any errors in her treatment of C.P.’s evidence or of the applicable law. Her finding, based on the evidence, that E.G. went directly to R.D. when she arrived at the party and that C.P. had heard her arrive as soon as he ejaculated and stood up, reasonably led to the conclusion both that R.D. was incapable of consenting and that C.P. knew she was unable to consent. The trial judge explained the bases for her negative assessment of C.P.’s credibility clearly, and why she expressly rejected key aspects of his evidence, such as his evidence that R.D. was “fine” during intercourse and that she had asked him for sex.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par24">24</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Writing in dissent, Nordheimer J.A. would have allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal on the basis that “proof of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt was not an available verdict” on a “fair and balanced review of the evidence as a whole”. In his view, the trial judge erred in relying on C.P.’s evidence that he heard E.G. arrive at the beach after he ejaculated, while rejecting all other aspects of his evidence. As C.P.’s evidence regarding the relative timing of his ejaculation and E.G.’s arrival was the “missing link” that tied the sexual activity to R.D.’s incapacitated state, it was incumbent on the trial judge to explain her rationale for relying on this single piece of evidence. He also found that there were significant problems with E.G.’s evidence about the time of her arrival.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par28">28</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When a verdict is reached by a judge sitting alone and explained in reasons for judgment, there are two bases on which a court of appeal may find the verdict unreasonable. First, a verdict is unreasonable if it is not one that a “properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered” (<i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 36, quoting <i>R. v.&nbsp;Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at p.&nbsp;185). In <i>Biniaris</i>, Arbour J. clarified that this standard, despite being expressed in terms of a verdict reached by a jury, also applies to the decisions of a judge sitting without a jury. She explained, however, that review for unreasonableness on appeal is “somewhat easier when the judgment under attack is that of a single judge”, since judges give reasons whereby</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">the reviewing appellate court may be able to identify a flaw in the evaluation of the evidence, or in the analysis, that will serve to explain the unreasonable conclusion reached, and justify the reversal. [para. 37]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par29">29</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbour J.’s comments in <i>Biniaris </i>led to the adoption, in <i>R. v. Beaudry</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, and <i>R. v. Sinclair</i>, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3, of a narrowly expanded, second avenue of review for unreasonableness. A verdict reached by a judge may be unreasonable, even if supported by the evidence, if it is reached “illogically or irrationally” (<i>Beaudry</i>, at paras.&nbsp;96-97, per<i> </i>Fish J. (dissenting in the result); <i>Sinclair</i>, at paras.&nbsp;4 and 15-17, per<i> </i>Fish J. (dissenting in the result), and at para.&nbsp;44, per<i> </i>LeBel J.). This may occur if the trial judge draws an inference or makes a finding of fact essential to the verdict that is plainly contradicted by the evidence relied on by the judge in support of that inference or finding, or shown to be incompatible with evidence that has neither been contradicted by other evidence nor rejected by the trial judge (<i>Sinclair</i>, at paras.&nbsp;4, 16 and 19-21; <i>R. v. R.P.</i>, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 746, at para. 9).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par30">30</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Beaudry</i> and <i>Sinclair</i> inquiry into illogical or irrational findings or inferences is not an invitation for reviewing judges to substitute their preferred findings of fact for those made by the trial judge (<i>Beaudry</i>, at para. 98). As MacPherson J.A. noted in the Court of Appeal, the “fact that an appeal court judge would have had a doubt when the trial judge did not is insufficient to justify the conclusion that the trial judgment was unreasonable” (para. 67, quoting <i>R. v. A.G.</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para.&nbsp;29). Nor is it an invitation to unjustifiably interfere with a trial judge’s credibility assessments. A court of appeal reviewing credibility assessments in order to determine whether the verdict is reasonable cannot interfere with those assessments unless they cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the evidence (<i>R.P.</i>, at para. 10; <i>R. v. Burke</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at para. 7). The inquiry into the logic or rationality of a judge’s essential findings under <i>Beaudry </i>and <i>Sinclair</i> is narrowly targeted at “fundamental flaws in the reasoning process” which means that the verdict was not reached judicially or in accordance with the rule of law (<i>Sinclair</i>, at paras.&nbsp;4, 26 and 77).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par31">31</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on <i>Beaudry </i>and <i>Sinclair</i>, C.P. argued that it was illogical for the trial judge to find that E.G. discovered R.D. in a state of incapacity very shortly after the intercourse. Building on the reasons of Nordheimer J.A. in dissent, C.P. submitted that the fundamental flaw in the trial judge’s reasoning was that she accepted his evidence that E.G. arrived right after the intercourse, but rejected his evidence on all other material points. Relying on the traditional <i>Biniaris</i> standard, C.P. also argued that the verdict was not one that a properly instructed trier of fact could reasonably have rendered based on the available evidence, because the evidence could not establish the timing of the intercourse with any precision.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par32">32</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my respectful view, the reasoning that led the trial judge to conclude that E.G. discovered R.D. in her incapacitated state right after the intercourse was both logical and rational.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par33">33</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P. argued that the trial judge’s “selective reliance” on his evidence regarding E.G.’s arrival was illogical because her reason for rejecting other parts of his evidence was that he was too drunk to be relied upon. In particular, C.P. argued that the judge could not logically reject his evidence, based on his drunkenness, that he spoke with E.G. for 10 or 15 minutes before she went to R.D., while accepting his evidence, in the same sequence of events, that E.G. arrived right after the intercourse.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par34">34</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument misapprehends the trial judge’s reasons. She rejected C.P.’s evidence that he spoke with E.G. before she attended to R.D. because it was internally inconsistent with his own evidence on cross-examination, externally contradicted by the evidence of E.G., <i>and </i>because C.P. was intoxicated, particularly in comparison to E.G., whose memory was “not suspect”. More broadly, C.P.’s intoxication <i>and</i> his dishonesty about his intoxication were among numerous factors relevant to the trial judge’s assessment of C.P.’s credibility. At no point did the judge find that C.P. was so drunk that his memory was categorically unreliable. The effect of intoxication on a witness’s testimony is not all or nothing.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par35">35</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a well-established principle that a judge or jury may “believe some, none, or all of the testimony of any witness, including that of an accused” (<i>R. v. J.H.S.</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para. 10). Here, the trial judge rejected certain key points in C.P.’s evidence but believed his evidence that he heard E.G. arrive right after intercourse. She provided sound reasons for what she believed and what she did not, explaining why she found that some of his evidence did not suffer from the same flaws that led her to reject other aspects of his testimony.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par36">36</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The verdict was also clearly one that “a properly instructed [judge or] jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered”<i> </i>(<i>Biniaris</i>, at para. 36, quoting <i>Yebes</i>, at p.&nbsp;185). There was evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that E.G. discovered R.D. in an incapacitated state shortly after the intercourse occurred. Crosbie J. was well aware that the time of intercourse could not be ascertained in absolute terms. She understood that “there was a lack of clarity with respect to the timing of the sexual activity”. The Crown witnesses were only able to “make a guess” about when the group arrived at the beach, and none of the Crown witnesses could “pinpoint the time” the intercourse happened. But what mattered, as the Court of Appeal majority explained, was not the precise time, but the “<i>relative</i> time of [E.G.’s] arrival in relation to the sexual activity” (para.&nbsp;56 (emphasis added)).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par37">37</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The combination of E.G.’s evidence and C.P.’s evidence satisfied the trial judge that E.G. went to R.D. as soon as she arrived, and that, on C.P.’s own evidence, her arrival at the party was right after intercourse had taken place. This entitled the trial judge logically to conclude that the totally incapacitated condition E.G. found the victim in when she arrived was the condition she was in <i>during</i> the sexual activity.</p>

Neither stage of the test for determining whether there is a breach of s.&nbsp;15 under our jurisprudence permits the objectives of the legislation to infuse the analysis into whether the limitation itself is a distinction that has the effect of perpetuating, reinforcing, or exacerbating the disadvantage of the claimant group. Only at the s.&nbsp;1 justificatory stage are the statutory objectives relevant, and then only to the extent that they justify the limitation (<i>Fraser</i>,<i> </i>at para.&nbsp;79).</p>

Does depriving young people of the automatic rights to appeal that adults have reinforce, perpetuate or exacerbate their disadvantage?

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par59">59</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Determining this constitutional issue requires us to first consider what benefit an automatic right to appeal to this Court provides. An appeal as of right to this Court when a judge of the court of appeal dissents on a question of law in a criminal case has existed since this Court was established in 1875 (<i>Supreme and Exchequer Court Act</i>, S.C. 1875, c. 11, s.&nbsp;49). The right was transferred to the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>in 1892 (see <i>Criminal Code, 1892</i>, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s.&nbsp;750). Professor Peter H. Russell explains that the “principal object” of an appeal as of right to this Court in a criminal case is to rectify legal errors in the trial of serious offences. Disagreement between members of the provincial court of appeal is considered sufficient evidence of the possibility of such an error, providing grounds for this Court’s review (“The Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada: Present Policies and a Programme for Reform” (1968), 6 <i>Osgoode Hall</i> <i>L.J. </i>1, at pp.&nbsp;13-14).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par60">60</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Biniaris</i>, Arbour J. echoed this view in her discussion of why a dissent on a question of law, including an unreasonable conviction, or one that cannot be supported by the evidence, automatically triggers a right of appeal to this Court:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">Criminal appeals on questions of law are based in part on the desire to ensure that criminal convictions are the product of error-free trials. Error-free trials are desirable as such, but even more so as a safeguard against wrongful convictions. [para. 26]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">No one before us challenged the merits of this proposition, namely, that the purpose of these automatic appeal rights is to guard against miscarriages of justice. The <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>provisions themselves reflect Parliament’s acknowledgment that a dissent on a question of law in a court of appeal, or a conviction entered for the first time on appeal, demands automatic review.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par61">61</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The importance of preventing wrongful convictions cannot be overstated. As this Court held in <i>United States v. Burns</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, “[t]he avoidance of conviction and punishment of the innocent has long been in the forefront of ‘the basic tenets of our legal system’. It is reflected in the presumption of innocence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;11(d)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>and in the elaborate rules governing the collection and presentation of evidence, fair trial procedures, and the availability of appeals” (para. 95). Robust procedural protections against wrongful convictions are crucial. The history of wrongful convictions such as those of Steven Truscott, David Milgaard and Donald Marshall Jr. are evidence of the unconscionable consequences of their absence. The very existence of wrongful convictions shows that the risk of miscarriages of justice is far from theoretical.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par62">62</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The automatic appeal right under s.&nbsp;691(1)(a) — available to any adult convicted of an indictable offence if a judge on a court of appeal has doubts about the validity of the conviction — is a significant safeguard against wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice. It is premised on the common sense understanding that a dissent on a question of law at the court of appeal raises a legitimate question as to the validity of the conviction, necessitating final review by this Court regardless of whether or not the case would otherwise meet the Court’s standard for leave to appeal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par63">63</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where a court of appeal sets aside an acquittal and enters a guilty verdict for the first time on appeal, s.&nbsp;691(2)(b) likewise provides a critical check on the safety of the verdict. When s.&nbsp;691(2)(b) is triggered, the right of appeal to this Court is the accused person’s <i>first</i> right of appeal. Without it, an offender acquitted at trial and then convicted by the court of appeal is left without a guarantee that his conviction will be reviewed by any court.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par64">64</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 691(2)(b) operates when a court of appeal substitutes a finding of guilt for an acquittal entered at trial. When s.&nbsp;691(2)(b) is triggered and a judge on the court of appeal dissents, the premise underlying s.&nbsp;691(1)(a) continues to hold true. The dissent against the court of appeal’s decision to substitute a finding of guilt raises doubt as to the validity of that decision.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par65">65</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even when the decision to substitute a guilty finding is unanimous, however, s.&nbsp;691(2)(b) serves, for adults, as an important check against miscarriages of justice. The purpose of the provision is plain. The reviewability of criminal convictions has “been an integral part of our criminal law system at least since the enactment of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>” in 1892 (<i>R. v. Farinacci</i> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), at p.&nbsp;42). Appeals are an “integral part of the criminal justice system in Canada”, which “protect against wrongful convictions and enhance the fairness of the process” (<i>R. v. R.&nbsp;(R.)</i>, 2008 ONCA 497, 90 O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 16). Accordingly, the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> provides for “virtually unfettered” first level appeals from findings of guilt (<i>R.&nbsp;(R.)</i>, at para.&nbsp;19). Section&nbsp;691(2)(b) is an expression of the basic concept that it is essential to a fair criminal justice system that anyone convicted of an indictable offence is entitled to at least one appeal from the initial finding of guilt, whether that finding is first entered at trial or on appeal. In this section, Parliament has determined that the availability of an appeal with leave does not provide a sufficient guarantee of first level review for adult offenders.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par66">66</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These automatic appeal rights, are, of course, no guarantee against miscarriages of justice, but at the very least, in providing an automatic additional layer of judicial scrutiny, they offer a significant procedural safeguard. The question then is whether denying this procedural safeguard to young people violates <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec15" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;15<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>.</p>

The philosophy of this system has evolved over time. A review of the system’s history shows a shift from a paternalistic model that limited young people’s procedural rights, towards a due process model that recognizes young people as rights-bearing individuals who require enhanced procedural protections to accommodate their vulnerability. The evolution of rights of appeal within the youth justice system has followed a similar trajectory. Crucially, however, young people’s access to this Court has lagged behind.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par69">69</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Canada’s first separate youth justice system was established under the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1908</i>, S.C. 1908, c. 40. The <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act</i> was animated by a welfare-oriented philosophy, with the court acting as <i>parens patriae</i>.<i> </i>Its purpose was expressed as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify"><b>31.</b> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That the care and custody and discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by its parents, and that as far as practicable every juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as a criminal, but&nbsp;<i>as a misdirected and misguided child</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>one needing aid, encouragement, help and assistance</i>.</p>

The “treatment-based philosophy underlying the legislation necessitated a system based on both procedural and dispositional paternalism because the emphasis in the [<i>Juvenile Delinquents Act</i>]<i> </i>was on helping the juvenile delinquent as quickly as possible” (Janet Bolton, et al., “The <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en" target="_blank">Young Offenders Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>: Principles and Policy — The First Decade in Review” (1993), 38 <i>McGill L.J.</i> 939, at p. 947).</p>

A first level of appeal was only available by special leave, if a judge of the Superior Court was of the view that “in the particular circumstances of the case it is essential in the public interest or for the due administration of justice that such leave be granted” (<i>Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1929</i>, S.C. 1929, c. 46, s.&nbsp;37(1) and (2)). The restriction on appeals was justified by the view that the expeditious resolution of young people’s criminal cases should be prioritized over due process rights (see Nicholas Bala and Sanjeev Anand, <i>Youth Criminal Justice Law</i> (3rd ed. 2012), at p. 466; see also Department of Justice, Committee on Juvenile Delinquency, <i>Juvenile Delinquency in Canada: The Report of the Department of Justice Committee on Juvenile Delinquency </i>(1965), at pp.&nbsp;154-55 (“<i>Juvenile Delinquency in Canada</i>”)).</p>

The limitation on appeals<i> </i>was subject to specific criticism. The Department of Justice Report entitled <i>Juvenile Delinquency in Canada</i> argued that the existing system for accessing appeals was “unduly restrictive” and recommended that the young person and the Crown be given direct access to the court of appeal on questions of law (pp.&nbsp;154-55).</p>

The Court explained that Canada has a separate youth justice system for a reason, namely, that “because of their age, young people have heightened vulnerability” (para. 41).

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:22.5pt;
line-height:normal">A young person should receive, at the very least, <i>the same procedural benefit afforded to a convicted adult on sentencing</i>, namely, that the burden is on the Crown to demonstrate why a more severe sentence is necessary and appropriate in any given case.

He explained that these protections are justified on the basis that the “procedural and evidentiary safeguards available to adults do not adequately protect young persons, who are presumed on account of their age and relative unsophistication to be more vulnerable than adults” (para.&nbsp;3). In particular, Fish J. found that young people are vulnerable because they “generally do not understand their legal rights as well as adults, are less likely to assert those rights in the face of a confrontation with a person in authority and are more susceptible to the pressures of interrogation” (para.&nbsp;24).&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:13.7pt">The underlying rationale for giving greater legal protections to young persons than to adults&nbsp;—&nbsp;like the rationale for the limited accountability of adolescents — is their intellectual, social, and psychological immaturity. Adolescents are less likely to appreciate the significance of the legal process and the legal consequences of the decisions they are required to make. They generally do not fully understand and appreciate their rights and are likely unable to exercise them fully without assistance. Adolescents are also likely to have greater difficulty in formulating realistic plans and advocating for their views in the youth justice system. They may also be more vulnerable to pressure from the police and other agents of the state.</p>

They are directly responsive to the vulnerability and concomitant disadvantage that inheres in young people because of their age. Sometimes young people will be entitled to the same procedural protections as adults, and sometimes different protections will be required.

The answer to this question depends on whether the deprivation of the rights to appeal to this Court reinforces, perpetuates or exacerbates young people’s disadvantage within the criminal justice system.</p>

It deprives young people of what is acknowledged to be a significant safeguard against wrongful convictions for adults, despite the evidence that young people are more vulnerable to them than adults. A recent report of the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Heads of Prosecutions Subcommittee on the Prevention of Wrongful Convictions identifies young people as a population that is at risk of wrongful convictions, explaining:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span style="background:white">Ample research now suggests that young persons are also more vulnerable to wrongful convictions, as compared to adults, for a variety of age-related reasons. The nature of the young developing brain is considered a key factor. In essence, youthful brains are wired differently, and those underdeveloped brains result in young persons being poor decision-makers, in contrast to adults. Experts across disciplines point to a trilogy of judgments by the United States Supreme Court, including&nbsp;<i>Roper v Simmons&nbsp;</i>where the Court acknowledged the scientific evidence that young persons are less mature, less able to assess risks and long-term consequences of their conduct, more vulnerable to external pressures and more compliant to authority.&nbsp;As a result, the traits that make young persons different from adults cognitively, socially and emotionally, may also make them particularly susceptible to the recognized systemic factors that contribute to wrongful convictions.</span></p>

These traits are significant risk factors for wrongful findings of guilt (Emily West and Vanessa Meterko, “Innocence Project: DNA Exonerations, 1989-2014: Review of Data and Findings from the First 25 Years” (2016), 79 <i>Alb. L. Rev.</i> 717, at pp. 728, 759-60, 763 and 783; Saul M. Kassin, et al., “Police-Induced Confessions: Risk Factors and Recommendations” (2010), 34 <i>Law &amp; Hum. Behav</i>. 3). The research also demonstrates that the risk of wrongful findings of guilt is increased when young people are denied the due process protections afforded to adults (Steven A. Drizin and Greg Luloff, “Are Juvenile Courts a Breeding Ground for Wrongful Convictions?” (2007), 34 <i>N.</i> <i>Ky. L. Rev. </i>257, at p.&nbsp;260; Joshua A. Tepfer, Laura H. Nirider and Lynda M.

Moreover, it is important to stress that the vulnerability experienced by young people in general is amplified for those young people who are indigenous or members of racial minorities. The unfortunate reality, as this Court recently pointed out in <i>R. v. Le</i>, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, is that “being frequently targeted, stopped, and subjected to pointed and familiar questions” by police is a “common and shared experience” for racialized youth (para.&nbsp;97). These young people disproportionately interact with the criminal justice system for a complex variety of reasons, which include both direct and systemic racial discrimination within the system (Bala and Anand, at pp.&nbsp;58-59; Robin T. Fitzgerald and Peter J. Carrington, “Disproportionate Minority Contact in Canada: Police and Visible Minority Youth” (2011), 53 <i>C.J.C.C.J. </i>449, at pp.&nbsp;450-54 and 473; Carla Cesaroni, Chris Grol and Kaitlin Fredericks, “Overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in Canada’s Criminal Justice System: Perspectives of Indigenous young people” (2019), 52 <i>Austl. &amp; N.Z.

Since <i>R. v. Parks </i>(1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 324 (C.A.), courts have acknowledged the wide range of ways the criminal justice system can disproportionately affect accused persons in these groups (<i>R. v. Gladue</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688; <i>R. v. Ipeelee</i>, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433). If being indigenous or a racial minority can have a disparately negative impact on <i>adult</i> accused persons, the double jeopardy vulnerability of being both a young accused <i>and</i> a member of a racial minority follows regrettably and inexorably (see Robert Mason, Library of Parliament, <i>Wrongful Convictions in Canada</i>,<i> </i>Background Paper 77-E, September 23, 2020, at p.&nbsp;10).</p>

Yet s. 37(10) of the <i>YCJA deprives</i> young people of the benefit of an automatic right to appeal to this Court when a judge on the court of appeal has identified a risk of legal error, a benefit that has long been available to adult accused people. Moreover, by virtue of its effect on <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec691subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;691(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>deprives young people who are found guilty for the first time by a court of appeal of the right to have their case reviewed <i>at all</i>. This deprivation demonstrably perpetuates young people’s disadvantage within the criminal justice system. It is a holdover from an antiquated and paternalistic model of youth justice and deprives young people of a procedural safeguard designed to reduce the risk of miscarriages of justice.</p>

But the process in the regular application for leave to appeal stage is by its very nature less intensive than the scrupulous search for legal error conducted during a hearing on the merits. As the Crown acknowledges in its factum, “[t]he leave process is designed to be more streamlined than the appeal process” (para. 56). While this Court strives to detect any sign that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred at the leave to appeal stage, the fact remains that an application for leave to appeal does not involve a screening for error in the level of depth that characterizes an appeal on the merits. Leave to appeal decisions are made without an oral hearing or the benefit of the full record on which to assess any legal infirmities.</p>

It is worth noting that the Crown’s argument on discretion was used, unsuccessfully, to justify the sentencing provisions that were deemed unconstitutional in <i>D.B</i>. Those provisions left the ultimate issue of whether to impose an adult sentence on a young person in the discretion of the sentencing judge.<i> </i>The Court found, however, that the existence of discretion did not make them any less infringing of young people’s s.&nbsp;7 right to liberty. The same reasoning applies here. Even though this Court could theoretically exercise its discretion in a way that reduces the unconstitutional effects of s.&nbsp;37(10), this does not render an unconstitutional provision constitutional.</p>

This evokes Sopinka J.’s <i>obiter </i>statement in 1994 in<i> C.

It is important to remember not only that these comments were made in <i>obiter</i>, but that the issue in that case was one of statutory interpretation, not constitutional validity.</p>

There is no basis for assuming that in those circumstances, Sopinka J. would have turned his mind to the role of appeal rights in preventing miscarriages of justice. Most significantly, his comments were made well before this Court’s decisions in <i>D.B.</i>,<i> L.T.H. </i>and <i>S.J.L.</i>, all of which underscore the importance of providing procedural protection to young people in recognition of their vulnerability. Despite the range of procedural protections afforded to young people by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, the fact remains that <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>provides young people with less robust rights of appellate review than adults on the basis of their age, in a context where they are already uniquely vulnerable. The existence of other procedural safeguards provides no legal comfort to a young person subjected to a dubious finding of guilt.</p>

Against that background, we held that the “multiplicity of interests” balanced by the impugned law will “colour the discrimination analysis”, as it is necessary to take “into account the universe of potential beneficiaries” (paras.&nbsp;3 and 38). <i>Withler</i> does not support the proposition that a legislative provision that perpetuates a claimant group’s disadvantage will pass s.&nbsp;15(1) scrutiny as long as a “contextual” inquiry shows that the broader legislative scheme is intended to promote that group’s other interests in different ways.</p>

The absence of that protection for young persons is the denial of a procedural benefit that perpetuates and reinforces their inherent vulnerability in the criminal justice system.

The most that will be saved is a few months in those cases where leave is denied. On the other hand, requiring a young accused person to go through the leave to appeal process before they are entitled to a hearing has the effect of prolonging the process, not abbreviating it in cases when leave is granted, since if leave is granted, the appeal will not be heard for several more months. If, however, an appeal is immediately scheduled because there is an automatic right of appeal, the process of fulsome scrutiny for error will get underway months earlier. That means that s.&nbsp;37(10) exposes young people to a greater risk of miscarriages of justice in aid of the possibility of saving a few months of time.</p>

Leave decisions are made by this Court without the benefit of a full hearing. Without these assessment tools, the Court is screening for miscarriages of justice with one hand tied behind its back. That is why Parliament decided that heightened scrutiny is automatically required <i>for adults</i> when the criteria under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec691" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;691<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>are satisfied.</p>

In this Court’s very first equality case, <i>Andrews</i>, the Court rejected a “sameness”, or formal theory of equality, adopting substantive equality instead, an approach that recognizes, respects, and accommodates difference (pp. 164-65, 168 and 171). The rejection of “identical treatment” under s.&nbsp;15 was confirmed in, among others, <i>R. v. Kapp</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, at paras.&nbsp;14-16 and 27-28, <i>Withler</i>, at paras.&nbsp;2 and 39-66, and most recently in <i>Fraser</i>, at paras.&nbsp;40-41 and 47. Instead, this Court looks to whether the specific limitation before the Court is a distinction that has the <i>effect</i> of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating the claimant’s disadvantage.</p>

The idea that the Court should decline to find that a limiting distinction has the effect of perpetuating disadvantage for the claimant group if it would encourage other rights claimants to come forward, undermines the whole of the s.&nbsp;15 analysis.

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 55; <i>R. v. D.B.</i>, 2008 SCC 25, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 37).&nbsp;</p>

Gamble</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 595, at p. 645; <i>R. v. Farinacci </i>(1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 40). Both parties acknowledge this. The outcome thus hinges on whether this deprivation is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par127">127</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asks this Court to recognize a new principle of fundamental justice — that young persons are entitled to “enhanced procedural protections” in the criminal justice system. A cornerstone of his argument is this Court’s decision in <i>D.B.</i> in which Abella J., writing for the majority, recognized “a <i>presumption</i> of diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability” for young persons as a principle of fundamental justice and held that, accordingly, “[a] young person should receive, at the very least, the same procedural benefit afforded to a convicted adult on sentencing” (paras. 41 and 82 (emphasis in original)). The appellant argues that <i>D.B.</i> constitutionalized the special status of young persons in the criminal justice system and established enhanced procedural protection as a guiding principle in the youth justice jurisprudence. In his opinion, the time has come for the Court to constitutionalize the latter principle under s. 7.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par128">128</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the principle of enhanced procedural protection satisfies the three criteria reiterated by Abella J. in <i>D.B.</i>, namely that for a principle of justice to be “fundamental” within the meaning of s. 7: (i) it must be a legal principle; (ii) there must be a consensus that the rule or principle is fundamental to the way in which the legal system ought fairly to operate; and (iii) it must be identified with sufficient precision to yield a manageable standard against which to measure deprivations of life, liberty or security of the person (para. 46).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par129">129</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But it is somewhat unclear from the appellant’s submissions if this principle of enhanced procedural protection entails a comparative assessment of procedural rights of young persons and those of adults, or if it is a freestanding standard that applies independently to young persons in light of their unique circumstances irrespective of what is available to adults. At times, the appellant seems to interpret the principle as requiring that procedural protections afforded to young persons be greater than, or at least equal to, those that are provided to adults throughout the criminal justice system. According to this approach, s. 7 guarantees that young persons will not be deprived of any significant procedure available to adults without good reason.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par130">130</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the content of the principle is indeed strictly contingent on a comparative assessment, one that fluctuates depending on the procedural benefits Parliament sees fit to extend to or withhold from adults at a given time, then it yields neither a meaningful standard nor one upon which any consensus is conceivable. To the extent that the concern is solely how young persons are treated <i>in comparison</i> to adults, the argument appears better suited to a <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec15" target="_blank">s. 15<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> analysis, not to one that engages principles of fundamental justice under s. 7.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par131">131</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the appellant, who is aware of these difficulties, also suggests that enhanced procedural protection can be a freestanding principle, which means that any procedural safeguard for young persons must account for their unique status in the criminal justice system. He submits that, rather than requiring procedures <i>identical</i> to those accorded to adults,</p>
 <p class="CITATION">the principle of “enhanced procedural protection” allows for a reasoned evaluation of legislative choices against the assumption that young people must enjoy special consideration in the justice system. It does <i>not </i>mean that for every procedure “X” adopted for adults, Parliament must accord “X + 1” or even “X” to young people. Differences in procedure — even ones that appear to confer less elaborate rights on young people — can be fully consistent with this principle provided that, when viewed in context, the procedure in question vindicates rather than derogates from the interests of the young accused.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par132">132</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with this freestanding interpretation of the principle, then, is that it quite simply offers nothing new. There is already a well-established principle of fundamental justice that <i>all</i> accused must be accorded <i>adequate</i> procedural safeguards against wrongful convictions or other miscarriages of justice in the criminal process (<i>Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,<i> </i>2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at para. 5). As for the requirements that afford adequate procedural protection, they “are not immutable”, but “vary according to the context in which they are invoked”, which means that “certain procedural protections might be constitutionally mandated in one context but not in another” (<i>R. v. Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 361; see also <i>United States of America v. Cobb</i>, 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587, at para. 32; <i>Idziak v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 631, at pp.&nbsp;656-57). In other words, the adequacy of procedural protections will necessarily be sensitive to the unique circumstances of young persons that have been identified by this Court, including their diminished moral culpability&nbsp;and their need for enhanced procedural protection in the criminal justice system (<i>D.B.</i>, at para. 41). If enhanced procedural protection is construed as a freestanding principle, the appellant’s s. 7 argument, worded differently, depends on whether s.&nbsp;37(10) deprives young persons of a liberty interest without <i>adequate</i> procedural safeguards.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par133">133</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, denying young persons an automatic right to a hearing in this Court where a court of appeal judge has dissented on a question of law cannot in itself contravene their constitutional entitlement to adequate procedural protection in the youth criminal justice system. This Court has steadfastly affirmed in various contexts that “there is no constitutional right to an appeal”, let alone an automatic one at the apex of the judicial system, including in circumstances that unequivocally engaged liberty interests and principles of fundamental justice that are cognizable under s. 7 (<i>Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 2007 SCC 9, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350, at para. 136, citing <i>Kourtessis v. M.N.R.</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53; see also <i>Chiarelli v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711, at p. 739). Fundamental justice does not entail “the most favourable procedures that could possibly be imagined” (<i>Lyons</i>, at p. 362). Although I do not foreclose the theoretical possibility that s. 7 would ever provide a right of appeal in some other context — an issue which need not be decided here — I cannot see how the principles of fundamental justice could require something as specific as an automatic hearing in this Court in the narrow circumstances in which a court of appeal affirms a conviction for an indictable offence, but a judge of that court dissents on a question of law.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par134">134</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such a requirement would have the effect of constitutionalizing the application of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec691subsec1" target="_blank">s. 691(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>to young persons, thereby implying that Parliament would be under a positive obligation to enact such a provision if one did not already exist. This conclusion would appear all the more anomalous in light of the fact that a leave requirement for criminal cases in this Court is the rule, not an exception. There is of course no automatic statutory right to appeal to this Court in a summary conviction case even when an appellate court has set aside an acquittal and entered a conviction for the first time, just as there is no right to appeal on a question of fact even when a judge of the court of appeal has dissented. What is more, the summary conviction procedure, which is the default procedure for young persons (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec142" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;142<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>) and in which the avenues of appeal available to an accused are generally more limited, has consistently been held to be constitutional (<i>R. v. R.L.&nbsp;</i>(1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (Ont. C.A.);&nbsp;<i>R. v. K.G.&nbsp;</i>(1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 81 (Alta. C.A.);&nbsp;<i>R. v. B.&nbsp;(S.)&nbsp;</i>(1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Sask. C.A.)). In other words, automatic appeals for young persons are not — in the words this Court used in rejecting a similar request to entrench the “best interests of the child” as a principle of fundamental justice — a “foundational requirement for the dispensation of justice” (<i>Canadian Foundation for Children</i>,<i> </i>at paras. 10-12).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par135">135</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A contextual assessment of the adequacy of procedural protections should also be sensitive to the unique costs of a prolonged appellate process in the youth justice system — for the young accused, but also for victims, who themselves are often young persons (N. Bala and S. Anand,&nbsp;<i>Youth Criminal Justice Law</i>&nbsp;(3rd ed. 2012), at p. 154, citing National Council of Welfare, <i>Justice and the Poor</i> (2000)).

The principles of fundamental justice “reflect a spectrum of interests, from the rights of the accused to broader societal concerns”, and while the fairness of a procedure will be assessed primarily from the point of view of the accused, “it must as well be looked at from the point of view of fairness in the eyes of the community and the complainant” (<i>R. v.

The appellant has provided no evidence that the absence of an automatic appeal in any way increases the likelihood of wrongful convictions or other miscarriages of justice for young persons tried for indictable offences. Nor is there any evidence before us suggesting that the Court’s leave process affords inadequate procedural protection. In other words, it has not been shown that there is an actual problem with the way the Court has been exercising its discretion to grant leave, let alone one that warrants a finding of a constitutional violation.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par137">137</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the leave process in this Court is rigorous. While it is true that leave applications are not subject to the same in-depth screening for errors as is the case in an appeal on the merits, the Court has a wide discretion to consider factors that might suggest a possibility of error, including the fact that a judge dissented on a question of law or a conviction entered for the first time on appeal. There is no basis to believe that a serious argument pointing to a miscarriage of justice would not meet the public interest standard for leave to appeal to the Court. As former Justice Iacobucci observed, “even where there has been no dissent or reversal of an acquittal at the Court of Appeal, leave to appeal in criminal cases often is granted given that criminal cases are frequently considered to raise issues of public importance because they involve the liberty of the subject” (F. Iacobucci, “The Supreme Court of Canada: Its History, Powers and Responsibilities” (2002), 4 <i>J. App. Prac. &amp; Process</i> 27, at pp. 34-35). The Supreme Court would and does exercise its leave requirement in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>

On the contrary, our modern youth justice system has long left those problematic practices behind, providing young persons with enhanced procedural protections commensurate with their unique circumstances and inherent vulnerability in the justice system.</p>

The issue is whether it draws a <i>discriminatory</i> distinction by denying a benefit in a manner that reinforces, perpetuates or exacerbates young persons’ disadvantage. In this respect, it should also be borne in mind that age-based distinctions are generally a “common and necessary way of ordering our society” and are “not strongly associated with discrimination and arbitrary denial of privilege”&nbsp;(<i>Gosselin v.

In <i>R. v. C. (T.L.)</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 1012, the Court considered the statutory interpretation of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en#!fragment/sec27subsec5" target="_blank">s. 27(5)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en" target="_blank">Young Offenders Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en" target="_blank">,<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en" target="_blank"> <span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en" target="_blank">R.S.C. 1985, c.

In that case, Sopinka&nbsp;J. noted that, in light of “[t]he policy favouring the early resolution of the adjudicative stage”, “there is no anomaly” in the fact “that a young person found guilty of an offence should enjoy more restricted rights of appeal than an adult who is convicted of an offence” (pp. 1015-16). Although he did not definitively rule out an equality challenge, Sopinka J. found it “difficult to accept that a young offender can select one aspect of the scheme and claim entitlement to the equal benefit of it with adults without taking into account the many related benefits accorded to young persons which are denied to adults” (p. 1017).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par144">144</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While <i>C. (T.L.)</i> was not formally dispositive of the issue, part of its underlying rationale remains relevant to the instant case. Sopinka J.’s <i>obiter</i> remarks caution against artificially cherry-picking individual features from a multifaceted legislative scheme in order to reveal inequities between fundamentally distinct systems. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia has made similar comments warning “against artificially isolating a single provision from a comprehensive criminal justice regime intended to benefit youth and thereby finding a constitutional violation” and stating that “it is improper to single out a particular subsection”, because each <span style="line-height:
200%">subsection “is so much a detail of the over-all comprehensive scheme that it cannot be, and should not be, considered separately” (</span><i>R. v. M. (J.S.)</i>, 2005 BCCA 417, 200 C.C.C. (3d) 400, at para. 31; <i>R. v. D.F.G.</i> (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 451, at pp. 453-54).</p>

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, 2011 SCC 12, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 396, at paras. 73, 76 and 79. The analysis instead requires a “contextual understanding of a claimant’s place within a legislative scheme and society at large”; the court must ask “whether the lines drawn are generally appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the persons impacted and the objects of the scheme” (paras. 65 and 67). Understanding the distinct legislative scheme underlying s. 37(10) is crucial to the assessment of the <i>actual</i> impact of the law on young persons (see P.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Monahan, B.

Davis-Barron, <i>Youth and the Law in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 2015), at p.&nbsp;177). In creating a separate youth system with distinct procedures, Parliament has acknowledged that, while young persons are uniquely vulnerable to miscarriages of justice, they are also uniquely vulnerable to harms resulting from protracted legal proceedings. These unique vulnerabilities are two sides of the same coin, and will at times even overlap. As Abella and Brown JJ. noted in <i>K.J.M.</i>, “<i>timeliness </i><u>as a procedural safeguard</u> takes on heightened significance for young persons” in the context of a trial, not least because delays could also affect their ability to make full answer and defence (para. 151 (underlining added)).</p>

Rather, I am simply giving full effect to the contextual analysis mandated by this Court’s approach to substantive equality (<i>Fraser</i>, at para. 42). The inquiry under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec15subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;15(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> into the perpetuation of a disadvantage requires attention to “the full context of the claimant group’s situation” and to “the actual impact of the law on that situation” (<i>Withler</i>, at para<i>. </i>43; see also <i>Taypotat</i>, at para. 17). The result of this contextual inquiry may in turn be to reveal that differential treatment is discriminatory because it perpetuates disadvantage, that it is neutral, or “that differential treatment is required in order to ameliorate the actual situation of the claimant group” (<i>Withler</i>, at para.&nbsp;39). This Court must, therefore, in assessing the actual impact of a leave requirement, have regard to the full context of the situation of young persons, which, I find, includes the fact that a structurally prolonged appellate review can be more prejudicial to them.</p>

In my view, considered in context, s. 37(10) does not perpetuate any disadvantage but, rather, appropriately balances the overlapping interests of young persons in prompt resolution and in appellate review, given the common sense understanding that there will be an inherent and inevitable trade-off between these interests.</p>

Viewed in context, a leave requirement confers the corollary procedural benefit for young persons of being protected from an as of right appeal by the Crown pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec693subsec1" target="_blank">s. 693(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, a safeguard that is not afforded to adults. Where a young person is acquitted by the court of appeal but one judge of that court dissents on a question of law, s.&nbsp;37(10) acts as a bulwark against protracted delays, and the benefit of finality and closure conferred by the provision is far from trivial, not just for the accused, but also for the complainants, who may themselves be young persons. The claim that this provision offers only “the possibility of saving a few months” loses sight of this crucial contextual aspect (Abella J.’s reasons, at para. 102). In other words, this claim disregards the fact that invalidating s.&nbsp;37(10) would also equip the Crown with an automatic appeal against a young person who has been acquitted. In my view, to dismiss the young person’s interest in timeliness as an argument that is relevant only to the justification inquiry under s. 1 would be to bypass the contextual assessment that is needed in order to grasp the actual impact of the provision.&nbsp;</p>

But this negates neither the promptness achieved where leave is denied nor the structural disincentive flowing from a leave requirement and its impact on timeliness in the youth criminal justice system as a whole. As well, leave applications can be heard more quickly than appeals and are likely to be expedited where young offenders are involved. Considered in the context of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> as a whole, s.&nbsp;37(10) legitimately fosters promptness and timeliness.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par157">157</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These benefits of the provision must also be considered in conjunction with the absence of evidence that this Court’s leave process perpetuates a tangible disadvantage for young persons. Put plainly, Abella J.’s contention that “young people’s access to this Court has lagged behind” is not borne out by any evidence in the record before us (para. 68). Neither the appellant nor my colleague could point to a single case in which this Court denied leave to a young person where a judge of a court of appeal had dissented. I would add that young persons are not <i>denied </i>access to this Court, given that “[t]he right to apply for leave is itself a right of access to the [c]ourt” (<i>Krishnapillai v. Canada</i>, 2001 FCA 378, [2002] 3 F.C. 74, at para. 24, quoting <i>Bains v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) </i>(1990), 47 Admin. L.R. 317 (F.C.A.), at p. 318). The final bulwark against a miscarriage of justice is not, strictly speaking, a right to an <i>automatic</i> appeal, but the right of appeal itself, whether by leave or as of right; moreover, “continuous re‑litigation is not a guarantee of factual accuracy” (<i>Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79</i>, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, at para.&nbsp;41). Where a young person brings an application for leave to appeal against an affirmed conviction after a judge of the court of appeal dissents on a question of law, this Court is uniquely suited in such circumstances to consider all relevant factors, including arguments pointing to a miscarriage of justice. Given the particular costs for young persons of an automatic oral hearing and an in-depth review of the record by a full panel, such a proceeding will not serve their interests in every case. This is especially true in light of the dictum that “[s]ometimes the opportunity for more opinions does not serve the ends of justice” (<i>Kourtessis</i>, at p. 70).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par158">158</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, no member of this Court would tolerate having a dubious conviction rest undisturbed simply to ensure a prompt resolution. And I am of the opinion that nothing in a leave requirement implies that wrongful convictions are somehow more tolerable in the youth justice system. This Court is not to rely on a dissent as a blanket proxy for merit in all cases, although that might be a convenient metric in the adult system. Rather, s. 37(10) allows it to take an individualized and sensitive approach which can also account for the harm of protracted appellate review in the youth justice system.</p>

The vulnerability of young persons in the criminal justice system is not exacerbated simply because a provision of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>fails to offer the maximum imaginable procedural benefit available to adults.

Another is that young offenders are not entitled to a jury trial in every case in which an adult can elect trial by jury. Nor do they enjoy the same right to a preliminary hearing, which has historically been narrower for young persons than for adults. And yet, in deciding whether direct indictments were available to the Crown under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, the Court has previously acknowledged that Parliament’s decision to restrict preliminary hearings for youth can actually be construed as a benefit:</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par162">162</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In choosing to deny young persons an automatic right to appeal to this Court, Parliament did not discriminate against them, but responded to the reality of their lives by balancing the benefits of appellate review against the harms inherent in that process, in keeping with the dictum that “there should not be unnecessary delay in the final disposition of proceedings, particularly proceedings of a criminal character” (<i>Kourtessis</i>, at p. 70). The fact that one specific feature of the youth system does not mirror a feature of the adult system is not a basis for a finding of discrimination.</p>

With respect for other views, I have come to the conclusion, like the Chief Justice, that <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">Youth Criminal Justice Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">, S.C. 2002, c.&nbsp;1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> (“<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>”), is constitutionally valid. I also conclude the guilty verdict rendered against the appellant, C.P., was not unreasonable and the appeal should be dismissed on this basis.</p>

I also share the Chief&nbsp;Justice’s view that <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> is consistent with <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>.

Like Abella&nbsp;J., and based in particular on the judgments of this Court in <i>Fraser v.

But in my respectful opinion the Crown has shown here that the limit to the equality right of young persons prescribed by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, when read in conjunction with <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec691subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;691(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;C‑46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>, is justified in a free and democratic society.

I agree too with his view that the Court’s leave process is sufficiently flexible to guard against the injustice brought by the leave requirement alleged by C.P. The Chief&nbsp;Justice sees these considerations of timeliness and the safeguards as relevant features of the context for the determination of whether s.&nbsp;15(1) has been limited; instead, as I shall endeavour to explain, I understand them as pertinent to the demonstration that the limit on s.&nbsp;15(1) rights is justified under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, which is a task that falls to the state. I conclude that <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> is constitutionally compliant, but I propose to come to that conclusion using some of the Chief&nbsp;Justice’s arguments on this different path.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par169">169</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is best to acknowledge, from the outset, that the burden of showing the limit on s.&nbsp;15(1) rights is justified that falls to the Crown under s.&nbsp;1 is a heavy one. It is best to recognize, too, that the benefit of timeliness to youth rehabilitation and reintegration into society afforded by s.&nbsp;37(10) represents, at least in terms of time saved in the justice system, a relatively modest advantage over an appeal as of right. Furthermore, it is plain that if the risk of a miscarriage of justice brought by the leave requirement in s.&nbsp;37(10) were a real one, that risk would likely outweigh the modest advantage of timeliness under the s.&nbsp;1 analysis. I share Abella&nbsp;J.’s view — I am inclined to think that all members of this Court would share her view — that swift injustice for a young person would be no justice at all. There is no virtue in timely rehabilitation of an innocent young person. Section&nbsp;37(10) would be a failed project if it championed rehabilitation over unsafe verdicts.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par170">170</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But in my respectful view, s.&nbsp;37(10) does not, practically speaking, expose a young person to a real risk of swift injustice and, notwithstanding the <i>prima facie </i>s.&nbsp;15(1) breach for age discrimination, it is nevertheless constitutionally valid. However modest, the timeliness advantage outweighs any true risk of a miscarriage of justice for young persons associated with the added leave requirement. There is no trivializing the risks of miscarriages of justice in the criminal law but, to my mind, the Crown has demonstrated that any additional risk of a juridical error pointed to by C.P. is more theoretical than real. Where a young person seeks leave to appeal against a conviction on a question of law on which there was a dissent below, and the proposed appeal has a reasonable prospect of success, there is every reason to believe that leave would be granted. Avoiding the risk of a miscarriage of justice — even if the question of law was a matter of interest only to the parties — would in my view be a matter of public importance warranting leave to appeal under the applicable provisions in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-s-26-en" target="_blank">Supreme Court Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-s-26-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;S‑26<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>, and the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par171">171</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was argued here, in particular, that the danger of miscarriage of justice is heightened when a young person must seek leave to appeal where, in the court of appeal, the dissent bears on an unreasonable verdict as the relevant question of law. I disagree. When the leave process discloses an arguable case pointing to a possible miscarriage of justice on this basis, the matter would be elevated to one meeting the requisite standard of public importance. This is because all of society has a stake in the particular young person’s liberty interest even if the question of law in issue is not jurisprudentially significant. Where the proposed appeal has a reasonable prospect of success — disclosed by the reasons of the dissenting judge, the application for leave, or the record filed in support thereof — leave would be granted because the public importance criterion will have been met. The notion that leave would be denied in such circumstances — that, for reasons of dispatch, leave would be denied to a reasonably arguable appeal from a young person’s conviction supported by a dissent below — is to suggest that this Court would act in a manner contrary to the principles of fundamental justice, which is untenable. Importantly, given the generous interpretation of leave criteria relevant in these circumstances, this Court is able to identify such cases on a leave application and distinguish them from those which should not go forward to the merits.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par172">172</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Imposing a leave requirement for young persons in the limited circumstances in which an appeal as of right to this Court is available to adults under the<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> is thus a proportionate measure open to Parliament in pursuit of the objective of timeliness, early rehabilitation, and reintegration of young people in criminal matters. This Court is institutionally equipped to identify and grant leave, based on the leave application including the evidence filed, which allows it to guard against potential miscarriages of justice in circumstances where young persons would otherwise have had an appeal as of right pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec691subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;691(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>. Where there is no reasonable prospect of success for the proposed appeal, the leave requirement can bring an end to cases that manifestly do not raise this potential injustice in a timely manner, before proceeding to a full hearing. In that light, it was open to Parliament, as the Crown argues, to enact <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, as a rule that brings an advantage of timeliness to young persons in a manner that outweighs any negative effects brought by the requirement of leave. For the reasons that follow, I conclude the limit on the guarantee against age discrimination is justified.</p>

Oakes</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp.&nbsp;136‑37). The law is well settled here: that party must demonstrate a pressing and substantial objective for the limit and that the means chosen to advance this objective do not disproportionately limit the s.&nbsp;15(1) right. Proportionality demands that the limit be rationally connected to the stated pressing and substantial objective, that it be minimally impairing, and that its benefits outweigh its negative effects (<i>Ontario v.

Law Society of British Columbia</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, that the burden resting on the state to justify a limit on s.&nbsp;15(1) rights is rightly an onerous one (p.&nbsp;154). I agree with Professor&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Martin, writing before she was a judge, that “a strong understanding of the interrelationship of equality, freedom and democracy under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> will provide the basis to distinguish between infringements which are reasonable and demonstrably justified” and those which are not (“Balancing Individual Rights To Equality And Social Goals” (2001), 80 <i>Can. Bar Rev.</i> 299, at p.&nbsp;364). The focus of the inquiry must be “on the seriousness of the discrimination and its relationship with the underlying values in a free and democratic society” (pp.&nbsp;366-67; see also p.&nbsp;365).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par176">176</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this latter point, I note that a limit on s.&nbsp;15(1) rights based on a person’s age has been viewed in some contexts as less serious and thus more easily justified. As Professor&nbsp;P.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Hogg wrote, a “minority defined by age is much less likely to suffer from the prejudice of the majority than is a minority defined by race or religion or any other characteristic that the majority has never possessed and will never possess” (<i>Constitutional Law of Canada</i> (5th&nbsp;ed. Supp. (loose‑leaf)), vol.&nbsp;2, at p.&nbsp;55‑66). Moreover, it is notable that this Court has found limits on s.&nbsp;15(1) rights on the basis of age to be more susceptible to justification based on legitimate state objectives (see, e.g., <i>McKinney v. University of Guelph</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229,<i> </i>at pp.&nbsp;297 and following; <i>Stoffman v. Vancouver General Hospital</i>,<i> </i>[1990] 3 S.C.R. 483, at pp.&nbsp;520-31; <i>Harrison v. University of British Columbia</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 451, at pp.&nbsp;463‑64; see also, relatedly, <i>A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)</i>, 2009 SCC 30, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 181, at para.&nbsp;110).</p>

The state must not only identify a pressing and substantial objective (<i>Fraser</i>, at paras.&nbsp;125‑29), but that objective must also be scrutinized so that state conduct resulting in the most odious forms of discrimination is not excused. As Iacobucci&nbsp;J., dissenting, put it in <i>Egan v. Canada</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513, “a constitutionally impermissible purpose will not save a law under s.&nbsp;1” (para.&nbsp;210; see also <i>Vriend v. Alberta</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493, at paras.&nbsp;115‑16). When considering whether the objective is pressing and substantial, for example, an avowed purpose of “injuring or degrading” a group would be plainly illegitimate (V.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Jackson, “Proportionality and Equality”, in V.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Jackson and M.&nbsp;Tushnet, eds., <i>Proportionality: New Frontiers, New Challenges</i> (2017), 171, at p.&nbsp;175).</p>

Gaudreault-DesBiens, eds., fasc.&nbsp;9, at Nos.&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;47). At the rational connection stage, the key question is whether the <i>prima facie </i>discrimination at issue furthers the legitimate legislative objectives (see <i>Egan</i>, at paras.&nbsp;191-98, per Iacobucci&nbsp;J., dissenting; <i>M. v. H.</i>, at paras.&nbsp;109‑16; <i>Centrale des syndicats du Québec v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>,<i> </i>2018 SCC 18, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 522, at para.&nbsp;44; <i>Ontario v.

A</i>, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paras.&nbsp;439‑40, per McLachlin&nbsp;C.J., concurring, and at paras.&nbsp;401‑5, per Deschamps&nbsp;J., dissenting in part; <i>Centrale</i>, at paras.&nbsp;45‑50). The means must fall within a range of reasonable alternatives open to a legislature to achieve its objectives so as to be minimally impairing (<i>RJR‑MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para.&nbsp;160; <i>Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, at paras.&nbsp;93‑94).

Indeed, when, as in this case, an enactment that limits the right to equality relating to the criminal justice system is scrutinized under s.&nbsp;1, judges’ “knowledge and understanding” of the workings of the courts may provide them with a “higher degree of certainty” than in some other settings when measuring whether the limit is justified in a free and democratic society (<i>McKinney</i>, at p.&nbsp;305).

Timeliness reinforces the connection between the actions and consequences, reduces psychological impact, avoids a sense of potential unfairness, and advances societal interest in seeing young persons rehabilitated and reintegrated into society as swiftly as possible (<i>R. v.

It has consequently been said that “[t]he effectiveness of the juvenile justice process depends at least in part on its timeliness” (J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Butts, G.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Cusick and B.&nbsp;Adam, <i>Delays in Youth Justice</i> (2009), at p.&nbsp;8; see also Department of Justice, Committee on Juvenile Delinquency, <i>Juvenile Delinquency in Canada: The Report of the Department of Justice Committee on Juvenile Delinquency</i> (1965), at p.&nbsp;154).</p>

By requiring leave in those circumstances where there would otherwise be appeals as of right, this provision serves the goal of timeliness. The leave requirement may well serve as a disincentive to bringing an unmeritorious appeal. Moreover, leave applications are generally decided more quickly than appeals. On average, this Court renders leave decisions in approximately four months (Supreme Court of Canada, <i>2020 Year in Review</i> (2021), at p.&nbsp;34). Conversely, it takes cases at this Court an average of eight months to be heard after leave is granted or a notice of appeal as of right is filed. Should the appeal be taken on reserve, further time will elapse prior to the time judgment is rendered. As the Attorney General of Canada argues, the leave to appeal process can bring an early end to the proceedings of applicants whose potential appeals are without merit (para.&nbsp;55). Such applications for leave will be dismissed, rather than proceeding to a full appeal. In this way, and while it should be acknowledged the time saved is not always substantial, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> is rationally connected to the goal of promoting timeliness, early rehabilitation, and reintegration. When C.P. argues that <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> “does vanishingly little” (A.F., at para.&nbsp;90) to advance the objective of early resolution of the adjudicative process for young people in order to facilitate rehabilitation, he is not denying a rational connection but proposing an argument that is best left to the final step of the proportionality analysis.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par191">191</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do recognize the appeal process may be longer on average for those young persons who are successful in their leave applications to this Court, as compared to a scenario in which there was no leave requirement.</p>

When the Court grants leave, it does so on the unstated presumption that the proposed appeal is an arguable one or the question of law requires the guidance of the Court. No such presumption obtains in respect of an appeal as of right. I note further that when leave is granted, an appellant is not necessarily confined to arguing the narrow question of law identified by the dissent in the court below as in an appeal as of right. Unless this Court restricts the issues that will be heard, leave to appeal is generally understood to be granted at large (<i>R. v. Keegstra</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 381, at para.&nbsp;28). This makes the comparison difficult.</p>

This margin of appreciation afforded to legislatures, as McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. explained in <i>Quebec v. A</i>, is particularly important where the measure seeks to balance legitimate competing social values (para.&nbsp;439). In that case, the provincial legislature sought to balance equal treatment of property rights and support obligations in conjugal relationships against individual freedom to choose whether or not to marry or enter into a civil union. McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. explained that the question the Court must ask is whether “the law goes too far <i>in relation to the goal the legislature seeks to achieve</i>” (para.&nbsp;442 (emphasis in original)). Likewise, in this case, Parliament set out to balance the various social objectives identified in the Declaration of Principle in designing a system of youth criminal justice (<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec3" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec3" target="_blank">, s.&nbsp;3<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>). The question is whether Parliament’s imposition of a leave requirement in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> goes too far to achieve its objective of timeliness, early rehabilitation, and reintegration in youth criminal matters.</p>

I acknowledge that imposing a leave requirement on an otherwise meritorious appeal could raise a potential for miscarriage of justice that is not present in the case of adults who have an appeal as of right. Youth must first convince this Court to grant leave before their appeal is heard on the merits, even though they are at least as susceptible to wrongful conviction. However, in my view, the leave to appeal process serves as an effective bulwark against miscarriages of justice and is sufficient to fulfill the requirement of minimal impairment.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par196">196</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court exercises its leave power in a manner that allows it to hear appeals in cases raising a potential miscarriage of justice. I acknowledge the observations that, as a general matter, leave to appeal is granted exceptionally (M.&nbsp;Vauclair and T.&nbsp;Desjardins, <i>Traité général de preuve et de procédure pénales</i> (27th&nbsp;ed.&nbsp;2020), at para.&nbsp;341), and that “[t]he single most important criterion determining the success or failure of a leave application is the public importance of the issues it raises” (E.&nbsp;Meehan, et al., <i>Supreme Court of Canada Manual: Practice and Advocacy</i> (loose-leaf), at p.&nbsp;3-3). But commentators have also long recognized that the concept of “public importance” does not necessarily mean that the issue raised in the application has a far-reaching impact on the law in criminal matters, as the Crown observes (R.F., at para.&nbsp;39). Sopinka&nbsp;J., speaking extra-judicially, noted that in criminal matters the public importance criterion is “not applied as strictly. If an applicant has not had a fair trial or was possibly wrongfully convicted, we may grant leave even in the absence of an ‘earth-shaking’ issue of law” (Meehan, at pp.&nbsp;3-4 to 3‑4.1, quoting an address by Sopinka&nbsp;J. given on April 10,&nbsp;1997). This principle was corroborated by Iacobucci&nbsp;J., writing extra‑judicially, who stated that “even where there has been no dissent or reversal of an acquittal at the Court of Appeal, leave to appeal in criminal cases often is granted given that criminal cases are frequently considered to raise issues of public importance because they involve the liberty of the subject” (F.&nbsp;Iacobucci, “The Supreme Court of Canada: Its History, Powers and Responsibilities” (2002), 4 <i>J. App. Prac. &amp; Process</i> 27, at pp.&nbsp;34‑35).</p>

Like an adult, the young person has a right of appeal on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents. Unlike an adult, by reason of s.&nbsp;37(10), the young person’s right of appeal requires leave.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par198">198</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P. says this constitutes a limit on his s.&nbsp;15(1) right to equality that cannot be justified under s.&nbsp;1. He argues — and in this he is joined by the intervener Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario) (“CLA”) — that when that question of law upon which the dissent rests is an unreasonable verdict, the added requirement of leave creates a serious risk that leave will be denied because the question of law will not be seen as one of “public importance”.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par199">199</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CLA says that “a test of ‘public importance’ implies that the legal issues at stake in the case must transcend the particular dispute between the two parties” (I.F., at para.&nbsp;12). The CLA submits that an unreasonable verdict, while a question of law, does not typically raise a question that transcends the parties’ particular dispute. Generally speaking, an appeal based on a dissent that has identified a verdict as unreasonable does not raise a novel or unsettled point of law that requires direction from this Court. As a result, submits the intervener, “an unreasonable conviction, will, largely, not be reviewed by this Court and errors upon which provincial Courts of Appeal cannot agree will not be corrected. Wrongful convictions will result” (para.&nbsp;2).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par200">200</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. This risk of wrongful convictions decried by C.P. and the CLA rests on a flawed understanding of the leave process.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par201">201</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the public importance criterion is best understood in this context as one that is engaged not only by jurisprudentially important legal issues that qualify as issues of public importance on that basis, but also by those that raise serious questions of law about the safety of the verdict in criminal matters. The issue of a wrongful conviction transcends the particular defendant and engages the integrity of our system of justice as a whole, thereby raising issues of public importance for the purposes of granting leave to appeal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par202">202</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By way of example, I note that in <i>R. v. Hay</i>, 2010 SCC 54, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 206, the defendant sought leave to this Court on the ground that the guilty verdict was unreasonable (para.&nbsp;1). Cromwell&nbsp;J., writing for the panel of three judges, found it was in the interests of justice to order the release of certain exhibits for the purpose of this leave application, due to the possible significance of this evidence to the unreasonable verdict issue (para.&nbsp;9). Ultimately, leave to appeal was granted, fresh evidence related to the released exhibits was admitted and the appeal was allowed on that basis (<i><span style="background:white">R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Hay</span></i><span style="background:white">, 2013 SCC 61, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 694, at paras.&nbsp;74‑75&nbsp;and&nbsp;78)</span>. These proceedings suggest strongly that this Court is alive to issues of unreasonable verdicts at the leave to appeal stage even if those issues do not necessarily demonstrate a broad legal importance that transcends the interests of the parties beyond the possibility of a wrongful conviction. This Court is unquestionably concerned with the possibility of miscarriages of justice (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para.&nbsp;26) and can be expected to exercise its power to grant leave accordingly.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par203">203</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note as well that in <i>R. v. R.&nbsp;(R.)</i>, 2008 ONCA 497, 90 O.R. (3d) 641, Doherty&nbsp;J.A. discussed leave to appeal to a provincial court of appeal from a decision upholding a conviction on a summary offence and, in doing so, analogized to this Court’s ability to grant leave to appeal for indictable offences (para.&nbsp;20). Notably, he explained that the interests of justice require granting leave where there is a “strong likelihood” an error of law by the lower court caused the conviction to be sustained (para.&nbsp;34). In the same way, I am of the view that this Court has the power to grant leave in youth criminal matters when the application for leave to appeal raises the risk that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the appeal is not heard and where the proposed appeal has a reasonable prospect of success.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par204">204</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as a guardian of rights under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>(<i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p.&nbsp;169),<i> </i>this Court has not only an ability to exercise its power to grant leave mindful of those rights<i> </i>and the fundamental principles of justice, but, in my view, has a responsibility to do so.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par205">205</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that this Court has the institutional capacity to identify possible miscarriages of justice through the leave to appeal process. In an application for leave, the applicant must file not only the lower court decisions and argument, but also any relevant excerpts of the transcripts or evidence, including exhibits, on which it intends to rely (<i>Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada</i>, SOR/2002‑156, r.&nbsp;25(1)). These materials must be filed with the Court electronically, in addition to printed versions (r.&nbsp;26(1)), and, pursuant to the <i>Guidelines for Preparing Documents to be Filed with the Supreme Court of Canada (Print and Electronic)</i>, January 27, 2021 (online), electronically filed material must be searchable. The overall result is that the evidentiary record relevant, for example, to advancing an argument based on an unreasonable verdict may be filed at the leave stage.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par206">206</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I recall that the as of right appeal from which C.P. would have benefited had he been an adult is restricted to instances where there is a dissent in the court of appeal on a question of law. The grounds for such dissent will be explicitly recorded in the formal judgment pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec677" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;677<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the&nbsp;<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>. In these circumstances, this Court’s attention is not only drawn to the dissent, but to the question of law that meant the dissenting judge would have arrived at a different outcome. In deciding whether a proposed appeal meets the criteria for granting leave, this Court will naturally consider, as a practical matter, the presence of a dissent in the court below as one sign that the appeal may well have a reasonable prospect of success. In some measure, one might be inclined to say that the very fact of the dissent is something of a red flag; it serves as a signal to the possible seriousness of the appeal for which leave is sought. In fact, a study of leave decisions between 1993 and 1995 noted that a “dissenting vote in the lower appellate court also catches the eye of the Court; dissents are significantly and positively related to leave decisions” (R.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Flemming, <i>Tournament of Appeals: Granting Judicial Review in Canada</i> (2004), at p.&nbsp;70; see also p.&nbsp;10).<span style="line-height:200%"> </span>It follows that the leave process provides an effective safeguard for young persons in those cases where a similarly situated adult would have an appeal as of right under s.&nbsp;691(1)(a).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par209">209</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">Section&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>addresses the heightened degree of prejudice associated with structurally drawn-out appellate review. As Doherty&nbsp;J.A. noted in <i>R.&nbsp;(R.)</i>, “[p]rolonged appellate proceedings detract from the timeliness and finality of criminal verdicts. Dispositions in criminal matters made in the detached, rarefied climate of the appeal court, years after the relevant events, by a court with virtually no connection to the place or people affected by the allegation are not the ideal way to resolve criminal cases” (para.&nbsp;16). Timeliness is an especially important goal in youth criminal justice with demonstrable and long-recognized benefits (<i>K.J.M.</i>, at paras.&nbsp;51‑52 and 54‑55) and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> confers those benefits by allowing this Court to filter out appeals that are without merit at the leave stage. As I noted above, the leave process is, on average, completed sooner than the hearing of an appeal as of right.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par210">210</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This benefit must be weighed against the negative effects caused by the <i>prima facie </i>discrimination. In this case, this is the fact that young persons whose conviction for an indictable offence is affirmed by a court of appeal, but with a dissent on a question of law, must seek leave to appeal to this Court.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par211">211</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that the appeal as of right to this Court has been described as “very meaningful” (House of Commons, <i>Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Legislative Committee on Bill C‑53</i>, No.&nbsp;1, 2nd Sess., 33rd&nbsp;Parl., October 5,&nbsp;1987, at p.&nbsp;17 (Robert Kaplan)). It is no doubt true that this Court retains jurisdiction as a so-called “court of error” on some questions of law in criminal matters. But, when compared carefully to the right of appeal with leave, the different role of the appeal as of right should not be overstated. As the Crown underscores, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i> does not deny a young person the possibility of an appeal to this Court (R.F., at para.&nbsp;38). It affords young persons the ability to seek leave to appeal on the basis of the process I have described above. Even where leave is required, this Court is alerted to the fact that a dissent by a court of appeal judge raises doubt, in the mind of that judge, about the safety of the verdict and is able to measure the seriousness of the argument that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The leave process allows this Court to identify and grant leave in those cases where there is a reasonable prospect that an appeal may correct a miscarriage of justice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par212">212</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarize on this point, I recall that Parliament, in enacting <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en#!fragment/sec37subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;37(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">YCJA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>, did not choose to take away a young person’s access to this Court, it only added a leave requirement. When deciding the leave application, this Court will have the benefit of the reasons offered in the dissent below on the question of law on appeal, as isolated by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec677" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;677<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i>. The Court will have the argument in support of leave and the required supporting materials, including evidence at trial, that will allow the Court to measure whether the question of law raises a meritorious appeal. Most importantly, and contrary to what C.P. and some of the interveners have argued before us, the criteria for granting leave as relevant to youth criminal matters means that when the liberty of the young person is at stake, a <i>prima facie</i> meritorious appeal on the question of law — including an unreasonable verdict argument — would meet the public importance standard even if the matter does not, on its face, transcend in jurisprudential importance the interest of the parties. Where, in such cases, the leave application discloses a reasonable prospect of success, this Court can grant leave.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par213">213</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons outlined above, I am confident that the leave process provides a safeguard for youth in circumstances where an adult would have an appeal as of right. It was open to Parliament to seek a legislative path that places greater weight on the negative effect of longer appellate proceedings that have no utility while simultaneously maintaining access for meritorious appeals through the leave process.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par214">214</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I conclude that the benefits in terms of timeliness outweigh the negative effects of the <i>prima facie </i>discrimination at issue. Any enhanced risk of miscarriage of justice as a result of having to seek leave to appeal in the circumstances raised in the notice of constitutional question is minimized by the leave to appeal process. Imposing a leave requirement in service of the broader goals of youth criminal justice is consistent with the place of equality in a free and democratic society.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par217">217</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from a verdict of guilty of sexual assault entered by Crosbie&nbsp;J. of the Ontario Court of Justice. The appellant, C.P., was 15&nbsp;years old at the time of the events and was therefore tried pursuant to the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">Youth Criminal Justice Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-2002-c-1-en" target="_blank">, S.C. 2002, c.&nbsp;1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par218">218</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was not in dispute that C.P. had had sexual intercourse with the complainant, R.D., who was 14&nbsp;years old at the time, at a beach party where both had been drinking alcohol. Because R.D. had no memory of the intercourse, she was unable to provide direct evidence that she had not consented. The central question in this case was thus whether R.D. had been too intoxicated to consent when the intercourse took place, and not whether she did or did not in fact consent. Pinpointing the time of the sexual activity was key to answering this question. If it had occurred <i>early in the evening </i>when R.D. was only beginning to experience some of the effects of the alcohol she was drinking, a capacity to consent could be inferred. However, if the intercourse had occurred <i>later in the evening</i> when R.D. was severely intoxicated, it would be open to the trial judge to infer that R.D. was incapable of consenting.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par219">219</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge (2017 ONCJ 277) found that the intercourse had occurred later in the evening. She therefore concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that R.D. had been too intoxicated to be capable of consenting at the time of the intercourse and that C.P. had had knowledge of her incapacity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par220">220</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (2019 ONCA 85, 373 C.C.C. (3d) 244) upheld C.P.’s conviction. Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A., dissenting, would have entered an acquittal. C.P. is asking this Court to set aside his conviction and to enter a verdict of acquittal. In the alternative, he asks us to order a new trial. I agree with C.P. that the verdict is unreasonable.</p>

Given that leave has been granted in this case, and given the conclusion I reach on the merits of the appeal, I decline to take a position on the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> </i>arguments. However, I feel a need to reiterate the importance of a dissent on a question of law. More particularly, in matters involving young persons, I am of the view that such a dissent, especially a powerful one like that of Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A. in this case, clearly indicates that an appeal has some merit and that the conviction must be reviewed.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par223">223</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2016, a number of teenagers met outside a liquor store (“LCBO”) in Toronto to “shoulder tap”, that is, to ask adults to go into the store and buy alcohol for them. The group of teenagers had planned to take alcohol to a nearby beach to celebrate the birthday of a certain T. Among them were R.D. and C.P.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par224">224</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.D. and C.P. had known each other for about two months. They became friends by frequently spending time together with other teenagers after school and on weekends at a coffee shop.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par225">225</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not clear exactly when the group was at the LCBO. C.P. testified that he had arrived around 8:30 or 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and was there for about 30 to 45&nbsp;minutes, whereas R.D. said they had been at the LCBO at about 9:00 or 10:00&nbsp;p.m. In any event, it is not in dispute that the LCBO closed at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. and that the group would thus not have left later than that.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par226">226</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After obtaining bottles of vodka for their party, the group of teenagers made their way to the beach. C.P. and R.D. walked together to a streetcar that went in that direction. They sat close to each other in the streetcar and talked. On the way to the beach, the teenagers were drinking straight from the bottles and passing them around.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par227">227</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To get to the beach, they had to walk through a parking lot and then down a steep hill. When they arrived at the beach, a group of older youths, who were already there, had started a bonfire. The older group agreed to let the new arrivals join them. According to her friend G.G., R.D. was not drunk when they arrived at the beach.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par229">229</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P. and R.D. sat down together on a mattress by the fire. They talked and drank together. After 15 to 20&nbsp;minutes, they started French kissing on the mattress. Their kissing was interrupted, however, when some people from the older group decided to throw the mattress into the fire.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par230">230</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having been forced to move, R.D. went to sit by some rocks about 5 to 10&nbsp;feet away from the fire and C.P. went to talk with one of his friends for 5&nbsp;minutes.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par231">231</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.D. did not testify at trial and was never cross-examined. Instead, the Crown filed a videotaped statement R.D. had made to the police and a transcript of that statement. In her statement, R.D. had told the police that her memory was blurry, but that she remembered kissing C.P. on the mattress until it was thrown into the fire and sitting by the rocks.</p>

According to C.P., they began again where they had left off. Despite her allegedly blurry memory, R.D. did remember lying on the sand by the rocks covered with a blanket and kissing C.P.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par233">233</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P. added that while they were kissing by the rocks, he started touching her crotch through her clothes. He testified that R.D. had then asked him to “Fuck me, [C.]”. C.P. admitted that this had taken him by surprise, but that he had no reason to doubt that she wanted to have intercourse with him. Given the earlier kissing, this may have appeared as the natural culmination of what was happening between them.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par234">234</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P. testified that after R.D. had said “Fuck me, [C.]”, he helped her pull down her pants and they had sexual intercourse. He did not use a condom, because he did not have any. He stated that R.D. had been conscious throughout the intercourse and that she did not appear to be too intoxicated to consent. R.D. told the police that she did not remember having had intercourse, but recalled pulling up her pants afterwards.</p>

This is surprising, given that it took place only 5 to 10&nbsp;feet away and thus must not have occurred unnoticed. In fact, there were a number of people who discussed that “event” among themselves that evening, and on social media the next morning.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par236">236</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P. testified that after they had finished, he stood up while R.D. pulled up her pants. As I mentioned above, although R.D. said that she did not remember having had intercourse with C.P., she did recall pulling up her pants.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par237">237</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not in dispute that E.G. arrived at the party after the intercourse and found R.D. asleep with vomit on her, and that, on being awakened, R.D. had trouble talking and kept saying that she was cold. What is in dispute, however, is the timing of E.G.’s arrival in relation to the intercourse.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par238">238</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the one hand, C.P. testified that when he had stood up after having intercourse, he heard that his friends J. and E.G. were arriving at the beach and decided to go talk to them, which he did for 10 to 15&nbsp;minutes. C.P., J. and E.G. then walked over to see R.D. and found her vomiting. In response to a leading question asked by the Crown in cross-examination, C.P. agreed, however, that E.G. had gone “directly” over to R.D.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par239">239</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, E.G., who had had little to drink that evening, testified at trial that she had arrived at the beach after the rest of the group and went <i>directly</i> over to R.D. upon arriving. But this testimony is inconsistent with E.G.’s statement to the police that she drank some of the vodka that had been left and then stayed with R.D. for the rest of the evening. If she stayed with R.D. throughout the evening, there is no time when she could have drunk vodka other than between her arrival at the beach and her observation of R.D. lying asleep, which has the effect of widening the gap between the time of the intercourse and the time when she went to see R.D.</p>

She also testified that when she left the party around 12:30&nbsp;a.m., E.G. had not yet arrived. G.G. added that R.D. had started throwing up just before she left.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par242">242</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At either 1:24 or 1:49&nbsp;a.m., R.D. had a telephone conversation with L.L., another teenager who was not at the party. L.L. testified that R.D. was slurring her words over the phone. She also kept apologizing, but he did not know the reason why. At the time, L.L. and R.D. had been seeing each other romantically, but they were not in a formal relationship.</p>

R.D. was helped up the hill to the parking lot. While the mothers were assembling the teenagers in the parking lot, R.D. and C.P. were seen hugging each other: R.D. had her hands around C.P.’s waist and her head was resting on his shoulder. R.D. then got into the vehicle of E.G.’s mother.</p>

It had instead been decided that she would be taken to G.G.’s house. G.G.’s mother gave R.D. toast and water and offered her a bed. R.D.’s mother was then informed that her daughter was staying at G.G.’s house.</p>

R.D. went back to sleep. After waking up, she read a text message from one of her friends, who told her that a picture of her sleeping under a blanket on the beach, with the caption “[s]he fucked [C.] then passed out”, was being sent around. Humiliated, R.D. said to her friend, “I wanna die [<i>sic</i>]”. L.L., the boy R.D. was seeing at the time, also got the message. Clearly upset, he forwarded the picture to R.D. and said “U fucked [C.]. Thats why im done [<i>sic</i>]”. R.D. answered “I don’t remember that tho [<i>sic</i>]”.</p>

It is noteworthy, however, that none of the text messages R.D. received that morning mentioned that C.P. had had sex with her <i>while </i>she was passed out. Rather, the message indicated that she had had sex with C.P. and <i>then </i>passed out.</p>

The medical staff swabbed R.D. and found DNA that was later confirmed to match that of C.P. R.D. initially refused to report the incident to the police. However, her mother managed to convince her to do so by saying, among other things, that not to report it would amount to condoning the fact that C.P. had had sex with her while she was passed out, although R.D. could not confirm that it had in fact occurred <i>while </i>she was passed out and the text messages were actually to the opposite effect. When making her statement to the police later in the day after she went to the hospital, she was asked whether she had wanted to have sex with C.P., and her answer was “I don’t remember it so, I don’t, I don’t think so”.</p>

Because R.D.’s lack of memory meant that she could not testify that she had not communicated consent, the Crown’s case rested on the theory that her intoxication had made her incapable of consenting in any event. The Crown therefore had to prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) R.D. was too intoxicated to consent; (2) C.P. knew that R.D. could not have consented; and (3) C.P. did not have an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The trial judge concluded that all these elements were established beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted C.P. of sexual assault.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">Had the sexual activity occurred <u>closer in time to when the group first arrived</u>&nbsp;—&nbsp;when R.D. was drinking but not yet feeling significant effects of her alcohol consumption&nbsp;—&nbsp;the Crown may well have had <u>more difficulty establishing that R.D. lacked the capacity to consent</u>.

[Emphasis added; para.&nbsp;90 (CanLII).]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">In other words, the question was <i>how long</i> after the intercourse R.D. was discovered by her friends in a state of extreme intoxication.

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">As the trial unfolded, it seemed there was <u>a lack of clarity with respect to the timing of the sexual activity</u>. As noted in the review of the evidence, the Crown witnesses were only able to make a guess about when the group arrived at the beach. <u>E.G. and G.G. did not witness any sexual activity</u> and therefore could not help pinpoint the time it happened. <u>R.D. had fragments of memory</u> but certainly was not able to specify the timing of the incident.

The trial judge did so, and she based this conclusion on, among other things, her view (1) that C.P. had contradicted himself under cross-examination, (2) that E.G.’s evidence was more believable and (3) that C.P.’s testimony was unreliable because he had been too intoxicated at that point in the evening.

In his view, her finding that R.D. had been incapable of consenting was “incompatible with the whole of the evidence, especially the uncontradicted evidence” (C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;15). Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A. disagreed with the trial judge’s finding that the intercourse had occurred <i>later in time</i> during the evening.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par260">260</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A. concluded that the trial judge had erred in law by failing to explain why she was isolating a single piece of C.P.’s evidence and rejecting all the rest. He noted that there was only one piece of evidence that could place the intercourse close in time to E.G.’s arrival. It consisted in a single answer given by C.P. in cross-examination in response to an ambiguous suggestion made by the Crown that E.G. had gone “directly” to R.D. upon her arrival. This single piece of evidence was crucial to the trial judge’s chain of reasoning. Without it, there was no other evidence that could connect the time of the intercourse with that of E.G.’s arrival. The only evidence E.G. could provide was that R.D. had been asleep when she arrived, but she could not say whether she had arrived shortly after or long after the intercourse, because she had not been there when it happened. Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A. stated that, although it is open to a trier of fact to accept only some of a witness’s evidence, the trial judge had to provide an explanation for her crucial decision to reject all of C.P.’s evidence but this single answer. Her not doing so constituted an error of law.</p>

E.G.’s statement that she had upon arriving found R.D. asleep could not therefore be relied on to establish that R.D. was incapacitated during the intercourse.

Rather, what was critical to the trial judge’s finding of incapacity was the relative time of E.G.’s arrival in relation to the intercourse. C.P. had testified that the gap in time between the intercourse and E.G.’s arrival was relatively narrow. 10 or 15 minutes would not have made a difference.</p>

An approach to the reliability of C.P.’s testimony that is consistent with the trial judge’s repeated findings to the effect that C.P. was quite intoxicated and that his memory of the crucial events was unreliable leads to the conclusion that the balance of the circumstantial evidence simply does not make it possible to pinpoint the time when the intercourse occurred. This means that the intercourse may have occurred at any time within an approximately two-hour window during which R.D.’s state changed from not being drunk to being unconscious.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par270">270</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="background:white">C.P.’s first ground of appeal is that the trial judge’s reasoning is illogical within the meaning of <i>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Beaudry</i>, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, and <i>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Sinclair</i>, 2011 SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3. Illogicality may occur in “various ways” (<i>Sinclair</i>, at para.&nbsp;19).<i> </i>In the case at bar, C.P. argues that the trial judge made two irreconcilable findings of fact. On the one hand, she rejected C.P.’s evidence that he had had a 10- to 15-minute conversation with E.G. when she arrived at the beach and before E.G. went over to R.D., because he had been quite intoxicated <i>at that point in the evening</i>. But, on the other hand, the trial judge accepted another part of his evidence about what had happened <i>at that point in the evening</i>, that is, his testimony that he had heard “that [J.] and E.G. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;had arrived” shortly after the intercourse. C.P. submits that if he had been too inebriated at that time to be subsequently able to testify reliably about the conversation, he would logically also be unable to testify reliably that E.G. had arrived shortly after the intercourse. Those two things would have occurred at the same time, a time when he was, in the trial judge’s view, too drunk to subsequently remember what had happened. C.P. points out that the trial judge failed to provide an explanation for this “selective reliance” (A.F., para.&nbsp;120). </span>I agree that the trial judge’s finding of incapacity was reached illogically.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par271">271</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I mentioned above, the trial judge was well aware that the timing of the intercourse was the central issue of this case. The defence did not dispute E.G.’s testimony that she had found R.D. virtually passed out with vomit on her. If the intercourse had occurred very shortly before E.G.’s arrival, an inference of incapacity would be more plausible than it would if the intercourse had occurred long before that time. According to G.G., R.D. was not drunk when the group arrived at the beach, but she became more and more drunk as time passed until she began throwing up around 12:30&nbsp;a.m. If the intercourse had occurred early in the evening, at a time when R.D. was either sober or, if drunk, not incapacitated, an inference of incapacity would therefore be too tenuous for C.P. to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. It is important to note that R.D. being intoxicated early in the evening would not mean that she was necessarily incapable of consenting. It was only when she reached the stage at which she became impaired to the point that she no longer had an operating mind&nbsp;—&nbsp;if that did in fact happen&nbsp;—&nbsp;that her consent would have become vitiated at law (see <i>R. v. Al-Rawi</i>, 2018 NSCA 10, 359 C.C.C. (3d) 237, at para.&nbsp;66; <i>R. v. Hutchinson</i>, 2014 SCC 19, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 346, at paras.&nbsp;55-57;<i> R. v. Barton</i>, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para.&nbsp;88).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par272">272</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was of the view that the question of the timing of the intercourse was answered by the “combination of E.G.’s and C.P.’s evidence” (para.&nbsp;90). The combination of their evidence was indeed crucial to her finding of incapacity. E.G. testified that she had gone over to R.D. instantly and found her to be extremely intoxicated (para.&nbsp;91). However, because E.G. was not at the beach when the intercourse occurred, her evidence alone could not serve to pinpoint the time of the intercourse in relation to the time when she saw that R.D. was asleep. Even if it is assumed that E.G. went over to R.D. instantly upon her arrival, that does not establish whether she observed R.D. within minutes after the intercourse or an hour later. Put simply, E.G.’s evidence alone was insufficient to support a finding of incapacity at the time of the intercourse. Whatever the case may be, additional evidence was necessary in order to narrow the gap between the time of the intercourse and the time when she went to see R.D. In this instance, only C.P.’s evidence could address the timing of the intercourse in relation to E.G.’s arrival and her observation of R.D.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par273">273</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P. testified that after the intercourse, he had stood up and heard at the same time “that <span style="background:white">[J.] </span>and E.G. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;had arrived”. This statement by C.P. helped narrow the gap between the time of the intercourse and the time when E.G. went to see R.D. The combination of this statement with E.G.’s testimony that she had gone over to R.D. instantly made the two events contemporaneous, if not almost concomitant. However, C.P. added that he had had a 10- to 15-minute conversation with E.G. before she tended to R.D., which meant that there was a gap of 10 to 15&nbsp;minutes between the events in question. According to C.P., R.D.’s state changed from being capable to being incapable during that time.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par274">274</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge bridged that 10- to 15-minute gap by rejecting the evidence that “[C.P.] spoke with E.G. before she tended to R.D.” for three reasons (para.&nbsp;93). So far, there is nothing illogical in the trial judge’s reasoning. It is well established that it is open to a trier of fact to accept only some of a witness’s testimony (<i>R. v. J.H.S.</i>, 2008 SCC 30, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para.&nbsp;10; <i>R. v. Mathieu </i>(1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 415 (Que. C.A.), at p.&nbsp;430, per<i> </i>Fish&nbsp;J.A., aff’d [1995] 4 S.C.R. 46). It was therefore open to the trial judge to reject C.P.’s evidence about the conversation and accept only his evidence that he had heard E.G. arriving shortly after the intercourse, provided that she had a logical and reasonable basis for doing so.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par275">275</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the trial judge’s reasoning becomes illogical, however, is in the three reasons she gave for rejecting C.P.’s evidence about the conversation:</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:21.3pt;text-indent:-21.3pt">a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Internal contradiction</u>: C.P. contradicted himself when he said, in his examination-in-chief, that he had had a conversation with E.G. <i>before</i> she went to see R.D., but then indicated, in a single answer to a leading question asked by the Crown in cross-examination, that E.G. had gone <i>directly</i> over to R.D. upon arriving.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:21.3pt;text-indent:-21.3pt">b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>External contradiction</u>: The trial judge preferred E.G.’s version that she had not had a conversation with C.P. upon arriving, because she found E.G. more reliable and credible than C.P.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:21.3pt;text-indent:-21.3pt">c)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Unreliability caused by intoxication</u>: C.P.’s evidence was unreliable because “he was [too] intoxicated at this point” in the evening (paras.&nbsp;91-94).</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">The source of the illogicality stems from this third reason.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par276">276</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is illogical is not the trial judge’s treatment of the existence or inexistence of the conversation, that is, her acceptance of a single answer from C.P.’s cross-examination that E.G. went directly over to R.D. and her rejection of the rest of his evidence relating to the issue of the conversation. Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A. concluded that the trial judge’s relying on this single answer without giving any explanation constituted an error of law (C.A. reasons, at paras.&nbsp;23-26). However, I am of the view that the trial judge did in fact give reasons for relying on this single answer and rejecting the evidence that the conversation took place. She rejected C.P.’s testimony about the conversation because alcohol had impacted his reliability, because he had contradicted himself and because she believed another witness instead of him.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par277">277</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather, what was illogical was for the trial judge to find, on the one hand, that C.P. could not testify reliably about what had happened after the intercourse because he had been too intoxicated at that point in the night, while also finding, on the other hand, that C.P. could nevertheless testify reliably about the fact that he had heard “that [J.] and E.G. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;had arrived”. These findings are irreconcilable. If C.P. was too intoxicated at that time to be subsequently able to testify reliably about the conversation, his testimony about having heard E.G. arriving was also necessarily unreliable. These two events would have occurred at the same point in time, that is, at a time when, in the trial judge’s view, C.P. had been too drunk for his subsequent testimony to be reliable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par278">278</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown counter-argues that the trial judge’s findings are in fact compatible. In the Crown’s view, it was open to the trial judge to rely on her credibility findings in order to reject most of C.P.’s testimony and accept only some of his evidence. She made detailed adverse credibility findings at paras.&nbsp;107-14. The Crown adds that the other two reasons the trial judge gave&nbsp;—&nbsp;the internal and external contradictions&nbsp;—&nbsp;were sufficient to justify her rejection of C.P.’s evidence about the conversation and her acceptance of his evidence that E.G.’s arrival was contemporaneous with the intercourse.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par279">279</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the Crown that those are two valid reasons for doing so. But that is beside the point. Again, the problem is not that the trial judge irrationally rejected the evidence about the conversation. Rejecting an internally contradictory testimony or believing another more credible and reliable witness is logical. Rather, the problem is that she made two irreconcilable findings. She found that C.P. had been too drunk at that time to subsequently remember some things yet not too drunk to subsequently remember other things that would have happened at the same time.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par280">280</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, if the trial judge had said that she was rejecting C.P.’s testimony about the conversation for only two reasons&nbsp;—&nbsp;the internal and external contradictions&nbsp;—&nbsp;and had not mentioned C.P.’s being intoxicated as an additional reason, her reasons would have been logical. But by adding this third reason, she introduced illogicality into her reasoning.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par281">281</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave no reasons to explain this inconsistency on a crucial piece of evidence. Without C.P.’s evidence that he had heard E.G. arriving after the intercourse, it was impossible to convict him. The trial judge explained why she rejected the evidence about the conversation, not why she cherry-picked “a sort of island of acuity” from “a sea of oblivion” (<i>R. v. Cedeno</i>, 2005 ONCJ 91, 27 C.R. (6th) 251, at para.&nbsp;20).</p>

Canada</i>, 2012 FCA 165, 431 N.R. 286, at para.&nbsp;46, and adapt them to the context of the case at bar, a logical flaw that corrupts an evidentiary finding that is crucial to the outcome of the case&nbsp;—&nbsp;the finding of incapacity here&nbsp;—&nbsp;does not merely pull at leaves and branches and leave the tree standing, but causes the entire tree to fall. Because the finding of incapacity has fallen to the ground, the verdict of guilty is unreasonable and the conviction cannot stand.</p>

If, however, the verdict is at the same time unavailable on the record, an appellate court must enter a verdict of acquittal instead of ordering a new trial (para.&nbsp;23). Whether a verdict of acquittal should be entered or a new trial ordered in this case will therefore depend on my answer on C.P.’s second ground of appeal.&nbsp;</p>

W</span>here, as in the instant case, the Crown’s case is based on circumstantial evidence, the appeal court must determine “whether the trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused’s guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence” (<i>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Villaroman</i>, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para.&nbsp;55).

In my opinion, the trial judge should have accorded far less weight to C.P.’s evidence about the timing of the intercourse in relation to E.G.’s arrival than she did in her reasons. The trial judge attached significant weight to C.P.’s evidence that he had heard E.G. arriving shortly after the intercourse. It constituted the centrepiece of her reasons. This was, however, incompatible with her repeated findings to the effect that C.P. had been quite intoxicated and was thus an unreliable witness.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par287">287</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After getting vodka from the LCBO, C.P. began drinking early in the night while the group was walking to the streetcar on the way to the beach. He continued drinking on the streetcar. Once they arrived at the beach, he drank even more vodka around the bonfire. According to E.G. and G.G., all this alcohol made C.P. very drunk. E.G. said that C.P. could not speak coherently or walk properly. G.G. added that C.P. was stumbling. C.P. himself confirmed that he had drunk so much that his friend J. told him to sit down because he could barely walk.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par288">288</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made several adverse findings against C.P. based on the evidence of his level of intoxication. First, she rejected his evidence that he had had a conversation with E.G. upon her arrival, because he had been too intoxicated at that point in the night for his testimony to be reliable. Second, the trial judge noted that C.P.’s level of intoxication could explain “his lack of recollection about certain details” (para.&nbsp;110). She added that, “if [C.P.] was as drunk as witnesses suggest, it would be understandable for him to have gaps in his memory” (para.&nbsp;114). Third, the trial judge concluded that, because of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec273.2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;273.2<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>(a)(ii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;C‑46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a>, C.P.’s level of intoxication barred him legally from relying on the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par289">289</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to C.P.’s unreliability based on his level of intoxication, the rest of the evidence relating to the timeline of the evening’s events further undermined the probative value of his evidence. The evidence did not permit the time of the intercourse to be determined beyond a reasonable doubt. A reconstruction of the timeline indicates that the intercourse may have occurred at any time during a window of roughly two hours.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par290">290</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, R.D. and G.G. stated that the group had arrived at the beach sometime between 10:00 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. This approximate time of arrival is consistent with the balance of the evidence. The group must have left the LCBO sometime before it closed at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. According to C.P.’s uncontradicted testimony, they then walked for 15 to 30&nbsp;minutes, rode the streetcar for about 15&nbsp;minutes, walked to the beach for 10&nbsp;minutes and then discussed whether they would join the older group or start their own bonfire&nbsp;—&nbsp;these were all narrative details the trial judge did not reject.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par291">291</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, 15 or 20&nbsp;minutes after C.P. and R.D. sat down together on the mattress, they started kissing until it was thrown into the fire. Shortly thereafter, C.P. joined R.D. by the rocks and had intercourse with her. I agree with Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A. that, on the strength of judicial experience, the sexual activity occurred in all likelihood before R.D. had gotten vomit on her (C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;31). In any event, the Crown did not argue the contrary.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par292">292</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, according to G.G.’s testimony, R.D. started throwing up sometime around 12:30&nbsp;a.m. No witness other than G.G. saw when R.D. started throwing up. C.P. testified that he had not been there, and E.G. arrived after that. G.G. left the party very shortly afterwards, at 12:30&nbsp;a.m. She was certain that she had left around that time, because she had looked at her phone before leaving. Contrary to other witnesses who were only guessing about the timing of certain events, G.G.’s evidence in this respect was unambiguous.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par293">293</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, E.G. arrived at the beach sometime after 12:30&nbsp;a.m. G.G.’s testimony makes this timing limpid. Indeed, G.G. was adamant that when she left at 12:30&nbsp;a.m., she had not yet seen E.G. In contrast, E.G. admitted that she was unable to affirm with certainty when she arrived. It follows that E.G. necessarily arrived sometime after 12:30&nbsp;a.m.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par294">294</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, following an undetermined period of time after her arrival, E.G. went over to R.D. and found her asleep with vomit on her. Whether E.G. went directly over to R.D. upon arriving or had a 10- to 15-minute conversation with C.P. first, as he testified, should not have been given the weight the trial judge gave it. There was in fact ample evidence arising from E.G.’s testimony to support a conclusion that going over to R.D. was not the very first thing she did upon arriving. The first piece of evidence was the fact that E.G. told the police that, when she arrived, she had drunk some vodka that was left. As Nordheimer&nbsp;J.A. noted, E.G. going over to R.D. instantly is inconsistent with her statement that she drank some vodka, because she also said that she had stayed with R.D. for her entire time at the beach until they all left. If she stayed with R.D. constantly after going to see her, she must have drunk the vodka before doing so. The second piece of evidence was E.G.’s statement that she had heard a rumour that C.P. and R.D. had had intercourse earlier in the evening. Her statement implies that when she arrived, she had a conversation with some of the young people around the fire about the intercourse before going over to R.D. This is what she said:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m not really too sure who was saying it but a few people were like, oh like, [R.D.] and [C.P.] like, had sex earlier today, tonight and I was like when? And they were like oh like, before you and [G.] showed up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="margin-left:0in">(A.R., vol.&nbsp;II, at p.&nbsp;30)</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par295">295</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This timeline shows that there was roughly a two-hour window between (1) the group’s arrival at the beach between 10:00 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. and (2) E.G.’s observation of R.D. sometime after 12:30&nbsp;a.m. The evidence as a whole cannot reasonably be interpreted in such a way that R.D.’s being incapable of consenting is the only reasonable conclusion. The trial judge should have acquitted C.P. Once the reliability of C.P.’s testimony is approached coherently with the trial judge’s repeated findings to the effect that he had been quite intoxicated and that his memory of the crucial events was unreliable, it is simply impossible to pinpoint, even roughly, the time when the intercourse occurred on the basis of the rest of the circumstantial evidence. In fact, the available circumstantial evidence indicates that the intercourse may have occurred at any time in the two-hour window. R.D.’s level of intoxication changed considerably during that time from not being drunk, according to G.G., upon arriving at the beach to being passed out later on. The trial judge herself acknowledged that, without C.P.’s evidence, the rest of the circumstantial evidence could not on its own pinpoint the time of the intercourse in that window:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">As the trial unfolded, it seemed there was <u>a lack of clarity with respect to the timing of the sexual activity</u>. As noted in the review of the evidence, the Crown witnesses were only able to make a guess about when the group arrived at the beach. <u>E.G. and G.G. did not witness any sexual activity</u> and therefore could not help pinpoint the time it happened. <u>R.D. had fragments of memory</u> but certainly was not able to specify the timing of the incident.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<u>The combination of E.G.’s and C.P.’s evidence, however, has answered the question of when during the evening the sexual activity took place</u>. [Emphasis added; para.&nbsp;90.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par296">296</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there is other evidence that, although not necessary to a finding that the verdict was unreasonable, should have reinforced the existence of a reasonable doubt in the trial judge’s mind.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par297">297</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the intercourse occurred at a distance of only 5 to 10&nbsp;feet from the fire pit where a dozen or so young people were assembled, the Crown did not call a single witness who had seen it happen. The Crown called E.G., who had arrived after it occurred, and G.G., who also had not seen it happen. Yet there were obviously some people who had witnessed the intercourse, as can be seen from the messages exchanged on social media the next morning in which teenagers shared the information that R.D. and C.P. had had sex together. Also, there were some who told E.G., after her arrival, that R.D. and C.P. had had intercourse earlier in the night, which makes clear that their sexual activity had not gone unnoticed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par298">298</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The phone conversation between R.D. and L.L. that occurred after 1:00&nbsp;a.m. should also have reinforced the existence of a reasonable doubt. During that conversation, R.D. kept apologizing to L.L., whom she was seeing romantically. When considered together with the rest of the evidence, it tends to indicate that R.D. was aware of and sorry for what had happened. In the same vein, the fact that R.D. remembered kissing C.P. by the rocks and pulling up her pants after the intercourse were further signs that she had been aware of what was happening, which constitutes fertile ground for a reasonable doubt.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par299">299</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Crown’s case appears to have been constructed on a narrative informed by rumours and double hearsay. As I noted above, R.D.’s mother may not have forced her daughter to report to the police, but she convinced her to do so on the premise that R.D. had been assaulted <i>while</i> being passed out. It is this narrative based on the rumour R.D. heard from her friends that appears to have informed the case built by the police and the prosecution. Obviously, this alone does not mean that the Crown’s case could not stand, but a trial judge drawing on his or her judicial experience should have approached the theory of the case with an extra layer of caution.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par300">300</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, without the crucial finding of incapacity, the Crown could not prove its case, because there was no evidence of absence of consent. The verdict is unreasonable, and the trial judge should have acquitted C.P.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par301">301</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C.P.’s third ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in law by rejecting his defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent. He argues that she should have considered his youth in assessing the circumstances known to him for purposes of the quasi-objective standard for determining whether an accused can rely on that defence. In C.P.’s view, the principle of diminished moral blameworthiness imposes the application of a lower standard. Although everyone is presumed to know the law, it is absurd to propose that an intoxicated teenager is presumed to know the intricacies of the jurisprudence pertaining to what constitutes valid consent. Therefore, the trial judge should have considered C.P.’s limited understanding of criminal law principles in analyzing his defence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par302">302</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the question being a matter of doctrinal interest, I do not believe that it should be answered in this case. Doing so would have no impact on the outcome of this appeal. C.P. asks us to rule on this legal issue in order to provide guidance to the court below should a new trial be ordered. Because I have concluded that a verdict of acquittal should be entered, such guidance is not necessary. In any event, even if I had concluded that a new trial should be ordered, the answer to this question would have had no impact on the outcome of the appeal. The question would be purely theoretical. C.P. does not challenge the trial judge’s finding that R.D. did not say “Fuck me, [C.]”&nbsp;—&nbsp;this alleged communicated consent constituted the condition precedent to his defence. Nor does he challenge the trial judge’s finding that his level of intoxication barred him legally from relying on the defence&nbsp;—&nbsp;this is another hurdle that made this defence unavailable to him. In brief, the error of law, if any, would be of no consequence. Lastly, it seems that C.P. is raising this issue for the first time in his appeal to this Court.</p>
