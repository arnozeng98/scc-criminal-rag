Independent evidence that supports the truth of an assertion is corroborative.&nbsp; The fact that C may have disclosed similar information to others is neither independent nor supportive of the truth of her assertions about the accused’s involvement in the murders.&nbsp;Second, the trial judge did not apply the correct test.&nbsp; A trial judge must start from the premise that the statements are presumptively inadmissible and then search for indicia of trustworthiness that can overcome the general exclusionary rule.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge reversed the onus. &nbsp;She also failed to consider whether the admission of the evidence under the principled approach would undermine the spousal incompetency rule or its rationales.&nbsp; In light of these errors, the trial judge’s ruling is not entitled to deference and it is open to this Court to come to its own conclusion on the question of admissibility.

Hawkins</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, the trial judge admitted Mrs. Couture’s hearsay statements under the principled exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; Following his trial before a judge sitting without a jury, Mr. Couture was convicted on both counts of second degree murder.&nbsp; On appeal, the British Columbia Court of Appeal distinguished <i>Hawkins</i>, ruled the statements inadmissible, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial.&nbsp; The Crown appeals from this order.</p>

Hence, it is argued, because necessity is made out by reason of the spouse’s incompetency, any out-of-court statement from the spouse may be admitted under the principled exception to the hearsay rule, provided that it is sufficiently reliable.&nbsp; The trial judge adopted this approach in ruling Mrs. Couture’s statements admissible.</p>

It was adduced at trial in the form of two out‑of-courts statements made by Darlene Couture to the police in 1997.&nbsp; There is no question that there must be a new trial if this Court finds that this evidence was admitted in error.

Marks also testified that, during the interview, he sensed a general reticence from Darlene to discuss the murders.&nbsp; For example, regarding whether Mr.&nbsp;Couture had told her how he moved the victims’ bodies, Darlene said:&nbsp; “And I don’t know whether David told me or not, or whether it was my mind, envisioned how he would have removed them.&nbsp; So I’m not certain.&nbsp; So I can’t say that as a fact. Right?&nbsp; Can’t say that as truth, that I know it to be truth ...” (A.R., at p. 453).&nbsp; It is apparent that Darlene was also reluctant to talk about the incidents of physical abuse which she had revealed in her first statement.&nbsp; When asked about her relationship with Mr. Couture and the physical abuse, Darlene talked about his “coping skills” and the fact that he was a “great guy”.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The learned judge and both counsel appear to have proceeded on the assumption that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Hawkins</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, ... determines the principles to be applied when the issue is an out-of-court statement of a spouse who is neither competent nor compellable.&nbsp; It may be thought presumptuous of me to say so, but I have always thought that the dissenting judgment of Major J., concurred in by McLachlin J., as she then was, and the late Sopinka J., was persuasive.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">There are some points of difference between this case and <i>R. v. Hawkins</i>: first, in <i>R. v. Hawkins</i>, the hearsay admitted was a transcript of evidence given under oath; second, that witness had been cross-examined; and, third, the marriage took place after the evidence was given.&nbsp; Here the marriage took place before the statements were given to the police.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">As to the first point, I note that the Supreme Court of Canada has recently re-emphasized the importance of cross-examination as fundamental to providing a fair trial to an accused.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193.&nbsp; The question for this Court, then, becomes whether these differences are such that it is open to this Court to hold that the testimonial incompetence of [Darlene Couture] cannot be overcome by the principled exception to the hearsay rule doctrine.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In my opinion, those differences are such.&nbsp; As she was testimonially incompetent, her statements ought not to have been admitted.</p>

The King</i> (1903), 33 S.C.R. 255, held that, under the provisions of the <i>Canada Evidence Act, 1893</i> (which did not include the words “for the defence”), the spouse of an accused was not only a competent but a compellable witness for or against the accused person on a trial for an indictable offence.&nbsp; However, Sopinka J., in <i>R. v. Amway Corp.</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 21, expressed the view that s. 4(1) only deals with competence and not compellability.&nbsp; He concluded in that case that the provision left intact the common law with respect to the non-compellability of an accused at the instance of the Crown.&nbsp; While it is unnecessary to settle this issue, I will assume for the purpose of this appeal that Darlene Couture, although not compellable by the Crown, could be compelled to testify for the defence.&nbsp; Quite apart from any issue of statutory interpretation, it is well‑established at common law&nbsp; that a competent witness is a compellable witness:&nbsp; see review of the relevant law in <i>R. v. McGinty</i> (1986),1 Y.R. 27 (C.A.), <i>per</i> McLachlin J.A., as she then was.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 645, at pp. 654-55.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of privilege does not arise in this case with respect to the alleged confessions made by Mr. Couture to Darlene in 1989 since these communications were made prior to their marriage on February 14, 1996.&nbsp; It would arise in respect of any later communications made during the marriage.&nbsp; The question of spousal privilege must be kept in mind in considering broader implications that may result from any modification to the law respecting spousal testimony.</p>

12.2pt">[O]ne can easily envisage that both the accused and his spouse would feel considerable resentment and distrust arising from the mere fact of the spouse’s testifying for the Crown and from cross-examination of the spouse by counsel or indeed by the accused himself, quite apart from the resentment that would arise if the accused were actually convicted as a result of his spouse’s testimony.&nbsp; There is more than mere sentiment at work in the marital harmony justification. If the marital relationship deserves protection — and most people would agree that it does — then at times other social goals, including even truth-finding, may have to give way before it.</p>

As Iacobucci J. noted in <i>Salituro</i> (at p. 673):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">The grounds which have been used in support of the rule are inconsistent with respect for the freedom of all individuals, which has become a central tenet of the legal and moral fabric of this country particularly since the adoption of the <i>Charter</i>. . . .The common law rule making a spouse an incompetent witness involves a conflict between the freedom of the individual to choose whether or not to testify and the interests of society in preserving the marriage bond.</p>

As aptly noted by McLachlin J.A., in <i>McGinty</i>, giving the spouse a choice&nbsp; “is more likely to be productive of family discord than to prevent it.&nbsp; It leaves the victim-spouse open to further threats and violence aimed at preventing him or her from testifying, and leaves him or her open to recriminations if he or she chooses to testify” (p. 40).&nbsp; Based on this rationale, the options for reform appear to be between leaving the rule as it is, or abolishing it altogether making spouses competent and compellable by both the Crown and defence in all cases.</p>

United States</i>, 358 U.S. 74 (1958), and <i>Trammel v. United States</i>, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), at p. 44.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Law Commission of Canada, <i>Beyond Conjugality: Recognizing and supporting close personal adult relationships</i> (2001); A.

Nonetheless, there are significant constraints on the power of the judiciary to change the law.&nbsp; As McLachlin J. indicated in <i>Watkins</i>, <i>supra</i>, in a constitutional democracy such as ours it is the legislature and not the courts which has the major responsibility for law reform; and for any changes to the law which may have complex ramifications, however necessary or desirable such changes may be, they should be left to the legislature.&nbsp; The judiciary should confine itself to those incremental changes which are necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric of our society.&nbsp; [p. 670]</p>

As indicated earlier, even when the criteria of necessity and reliability are satisfied, the trial judge has the residual discretion under the principled exception to the hearsay rule to exclude the statement where its probative value is slight and undue prejudice might result to the accused.&nbsp; Consideration of the spousal incompetency rule, however, is a distinct exercise, unrelated to any consideration of the probative value of the evidence under the hearsay analysis.&nbsp; The proposed evidence may be highly probative; it will nonetheless be inadmissible if its admission would undermine the spousal incompetency rule.&nbsp; This is why I say that consideration of the rule is not a matter of “residual discretion” as this term is generally understood.&nbsp; The fact that the rule cannot be ignored is rather a feature of the “principled exception” to the hearsay rule itself.&nbsp; This modern approach, as the coined expression reveals, is based on <i>principle</i>.&nbsp; Unless there is good reason to depart from an established principle, the modern approach to hearsay admissibility must be applied in a manner that preserves its integrity.&nbsp; Hence, as was done in <i>Hawkins</i>, hearsay evidence may be admitted under the principled approach if it meets the twin criteria of necessity and reliability <i>and</i> if its admission would not undermine the spousal incompetency rule or its rationales.</p>

Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531.&nbsp; For example here, Darlene told the police that Mr. Couture had admitted to sexually assaulting both victims after their death.&nbsp; There was no forensic evidence of this nature on the <i>voir dire</i> or at trial.&nbsp; However, assuming that there had been evidence that the victims had indeed been sexually assaulted, and that this evidence was not likely to have been known by anyone other than the investigators and the perpetrator at the time of the statement, this corroborative evidence would lend much cogency to the statement.&nbsp; However here, the evidence erroneously relied upon by the trial judge as corroborative is of no assistance in assessing the inherent trustworthiness of Darlene’s statements.</p>

Recall <i>U.

In other words, the hearsay evidence was made under circumstances which substantially negate the possibility that the declarant was untruthful or mistaken: <i>Smith</i>, at p. 933.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">Generally, the common law insists that evidence be presented under oath and subjected to cross‑examination.&nbsp; But “[w]here the test of cross‑examination is <i><u>impossible of application</u></i>, by reason of the declarant’s death or some other cause rendering him now unavailable as a witness on the stand, we are faced with the alternatives of receiving his statements without that test, or of leaving his knowledge altogether unutilized” (Wigmore, <i>supra</i>, §1420 (italics in original; underlining added)).&nbsp; This is precisely the choice that faced the trial judge in this case.&nbsp; <u>The witness’s incapacity, for whatever reason, to produce meaningful evidence, faced the court with the spectre of either receiving her out‑of‑court statements without the test of cross‑examination, or of leaving her potentially reliable and clearly relevant knowledge of the crimes with which the accused was charged altogether unutilized.</u></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The question then becomes whether the interests of justice, or to use Wigmore’s term, “the interests of efficient investigation” (§1420), would suffer more from the first alternative of receiving the out‑of‑court statements or the second alternative of leaving the witness’s knowledge entirely unused. Wigmore’s answer is that the first alternative is preferable, provided that there is sufficient indication of the trustworthiness of the witness’s statement. [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, to place such weight on contemporaneous cross-examination in the face of numerous indicia of reliability found by the trial judge (discussed below) is a departure from this Court’s jurisprudence as to what makes a hearsay statement circumstantially reliable, regardless of whether or not the spousal incompetence rule is at play.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This excerpt can be found in the first paragraph of the section dealing with the “reliability” criterion in J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman and A.W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 1999), at para. 6.80.&nbsp; In my view, the passage goes a long way towards explaining why the trial judge may have chosen the language that she did.&nbsp; While the trial judge’s choice of language may not have been ideal, I think it is important for appellate courts to be cautious not to seize on an ambiguous or less than exemplary choice of words as indicative of legal error absent an examination of the judgment as a whole.&nbsp; As noted by Binnie J. in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, 2002 SCC 26, at para. 26: “The appellate court is not given the power to intervene simply because it thinks the trial court did a poor job of expressing itself.”</p>

Sankoff in his article “Spousal Incompetence and the Principled Approach to Hearsay Admissibility: When Ancient and Modern Doctrines Collide” (2006), 35 C.R. (6th) 43:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">In <i>Hawkins</i>, the accused could have argued that the statements were made at a time when marital harmony was not in issue, and that admitting them consequent to the marriage of the spouses would jeopardize the relationship. This line of argument was not available in <i>Couture</i>, and in the absence of any evidence detailing the impact admission would have on the marriage, it is difficult to see any reason why the evidence should have been excluded under the residual discretion.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">The rule is triggered by the very existence of a valid and subsisting marriage.&nbsp; Unless the accused and the spouse are irreconcilably separated, thus giving rise to the exception in <i>Salituro</i>, <u>the extent to which there is marital harmony or marital discordance <i>in the particular marriage</i> is irrelevant</u>.&nbsp; The question rather is whether, from an <u>objective</u> standpoint, the operation of the principled exception to the hearsay rule in the particular circumstances of the case would be disruptive of marital harmony or give rise to the natural repugnance resulting from one spouse testifying against the other. [Emphasis added; para. 66.]</p>

Jean</i> (1979), 7 C.R. (3d) 338 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.), at p. 348 (affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada [1980] 1 S.C.R. 400); Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, at para. 14.140.&nbsp; Is such evidence to be excluded in the future on the basis that it undermines the rationale for the spousal testimonial incompetence rule?</p>

Henry</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, 2005 SCC 76, at para. 44.</p>
