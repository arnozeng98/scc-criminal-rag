The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, at&nbsp;p.&nbsp;515.&nbsp; Two aspects of that decision are relevant here.&nbsp; First, the opinion of experts is always subject to evaluation by the courts.&nbsp; Second, and more importantly, the kind of expert testimony which was at issue in that case was testimony by the Chairman of the Censor Board that a film called <i>Dracula Sucks</i>, the content of which gave rise to the litigation, did not fall below the contemporary community standard of tolerance.&nbsp; The evidence there bore directly on the matter before the Court.&nbsp; The evidence given by Dr.&nbsp;Campbell, who is concerned with human sexual behaviour and treatment of sexual problems, is very different.&nbsp; It relates essentially to the normality of the activity of masturbation which he considered was engaged in by a large portion of the population, but undoubtedly in a private place.&nbsp; While this testimony may bear on how persons may view private acts of masturbation, it is not relevant in the manner accepted at trial.&nbsp; Testimony that an activity is not a perversion may be directly relevant to excluding that activity from the category of those acts which would be indecent wherever they occurred.&nbsp; But such a narrow and straightforward inquiry is not what is at issue here.&nbsp; The normality of an act in private cannot be directly relied upon in establishing the tolerance of that act in public when, as here, the act is in part defined by its public character.&nbsp; All the circumstances of the act must be considered, and the act in all its features must be examined.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the very qualities of an act which make it normal in private may not make it normal in public.&nbsp; The normality of an activity undertaken in private does not demonstrate that the same activity would be tolerated in public.</span></p>

Laliberté</i> (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 109, a case involving masturbation of clients by masseuses in a massage parlour.&nbsp; Cory&nbsp;J. refers to that case, and distinguishes it, as he does <i>R. v. Lantay</i>, [1966] 3 C.C.C. 270, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal.&nbsp; While it is true that in both cases there was physical contact between the client and the woman offering services, the presence of physical contact did not in my view form the basis for the conclusion that masturbation in a place to which the public have access is indecent, or an act of prostitution.&nbsp; Indeed, the latter decision, which is referred to by the former case, relies upon the English authority of <i>R. v. De Munck</i>, [1918] 1 K.B. 635.&nbsp; That case decided at pp.&nbsp;637-38 that "prostitution is proved if it be shown that a woman offers her body commonly for lewdness for payment in return", intercourse was not a requirement.&nbsp; The law has never required that the most lewd form or variety of an activity which is not tolerated by the community occur in order that such activity be viewed as indecent.&nbsp; It does not do so here.</span></p>

Butler</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452, this Court considered the community standard of tolerance in order to determine whether the pornographic material in question constituted such an undue exploitation of sex that it could be labelled obscene.&nbsp; In that case one of the issues the Court considered was when a work might cease to be art and becomes, instead, obscene.&nbsp; Sopinka J. concluded that the final determination of that question might lie with the degree of harm which could result from public exposure to the impugned material.&nbsp; At page&nbsp;485 he stated:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would note that Constable Gilles&nbsp;Rochon testified that on various occasions he had viewed video films depicting graphic sexual scenes involving anal and vaginal penetration, masturbation, cunnilingus and fellatio in several strip bars without concluding that charges should be brought.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us consider the circumstances that surrounded the acts in this case.&nbsp; As we have seen in this case the acts, in themselves, of both the clients and the dancers came within the range of community tolerance.&nbsp; This conclusion with regard to the acts of masturbation was properly drawn on the basis of the evidence given by Dr. Campbell on human sexual behaviour and attitudes and on the report of the Fraser Committee on Pornography and Prostitution.&nbsp; With regard to the performance of the dances, the conclusion could be properly based upon the evidence of those who had, in the past, performed in strip bars and the evidence of police tolerance of activities in strip bars which were similar to those performed at the Pussy Cat.&nbsp; The inquiry must then focus on the circumstances which surrounded the activities at the Pussy Cat.&nbsp; It is those circumstances which will determine whether the activities would be tolerated by the community.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><i><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The Rule Against Physical Contact</span></i></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is significant that clients were warned when they first arrived at the Pussy Cat and again later by the dancer which they had selected that there was to be no physical contact of any kind.&nbsp; That was the rule of the establishment and there is no evidence that it was ever breached.&nbsp; It is true that there was masturbation, or in the case of the dancer, simulated masturbation.&nbsp; Whether the act of masturbation itself is indecent must depend on all the surrounding circumstances or the context in which it takes place.&nbsp; If masturbation can be one of the principal themes of the well accepted novel, <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> (1969), by the outstanding author Philip Roth, it surely cannot have the same connotation of indecency it possessed in the past.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the lack of physical contact is not determinative of the issue, it is nonetheless highly significant.&nbsp; The rule ensured that there would be little likelihood that physical harm or hurt would be done to either individual.&nbsp; Of equal importance was that it ensured that the transmission of infectious sexual diseases was prevented.&nbsp; This factor should increase the level of the tolerance of the community for the acts performed at the Pussy Cat.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note also that in those reported cases where masturbation was held to have been indecent it was clearly established that there was physical contact between the client and the woman performing the services.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Laliberté</i> (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 109 (Que. C.A.), and <i>R. v. Lantay</i>, <i>supra</i>.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be forgotten that the sexual activities were conducted behind closed doors out of the view of the general public.&nbsp; It is true that the public did have access to the Pussy Cat premises.&nbsp; Thus it came within the definition of a public place provided by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec150" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;150<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, which "includes any place to which the public have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied".&nbsp; Nonetheless, common sense indicates that there are great differences between locations which can come within the definition of public places.&nbsp; Obviously, the performance of an activity in a closed room in a house, where only two consenting adults are present is far different from carrying out the same activity in a school yard or a public park.</span></p>
