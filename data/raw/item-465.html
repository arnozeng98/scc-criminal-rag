For example, in a statement provided to the police shortly after her son's death from the complications of diabetic hyperglycemia the respondent Carol Anne Tutton stated:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application of an objective test under s. 202 of the</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Code</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">, however, may not be made in a vacuum.&nbsp; Events occur within the framework of other events and actions and when deciding on the nature of the questioned conduct surrounding circumstances must be considered.&nbsp; The decision must be made on a consideration of the facts existing at the time and in relation to the accused's perception of those facts.&nbsp; Since the test is objective, the accused's perception of the facts is not to be considered for the purpose of assessing malice or intention on the accused's part but only to form a basis for a conclusion as to whether or not the accused's conduct, in view of his perception of the facts, was reasonable.&nbsp; This is particularly true where, as here, the accused have raised the defence of mistake of fact.&nbsp; If an accused under s. 202 has an honest and reasonably held belief in the existence of certain facts, it may be a relevant consideration in assessing the reasonableness of his conduct.&nbsp; For example, a welder, who is engaged to work in a confined space believing on the assurance of the owner of the premises that no combustible or explosive material is stored nearby, should be entitled to have his perception, as to the presence or absence of dangerous materials, before the jury on a charge of manslaughter when his welding torch causes an explosion and a consequent death.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted earlier, the Tuttons raised the defence of mistake of fact at trial.&nbsp; They argued that the failure to supply insulin was based upon the belief that the child had been cured by Divine intervention and that the failure to provide medical care in timely fashion was based upon the belief that the child was not seriously ill, so medical assistance was not necessary.&nbsp; The trial judge, it was argued, was in error in telling the jury that for any such belief to be effective as a defence it must have been reasonably held.&nbsp; It was held in this Court in</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Pappajohn v. The Queen</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, that an honest, though mistaken, belief in the existence of circumstances which, if present, would make the questioned conduct non-culpable would entitle an accused to an acquittal.&nbsp; It was also held in</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Pappajohn v. The Queen</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
letter-spacing:-.15pt"> that the honest belief need not be reasonable, because its effect would be to deny the existence of the requisite</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> mens rea</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">.&nbsp; The situation would be different, however, where the offence charged rests upon the concept of negligence, as opposed to that of the guilty mind or blameworthy mental state.&nbsp; In such case, an unreasonable though honest belief on the part of the accused would be negligently held.&nbsp; The holding of such a belief could not afford a defence when culpability is based on negligent conduct.&nbsp; I would therefore conclude that the trial judge made no error in charging the jury to the effect that any mistaken belief which could afford a defence in a charge of criminal negligence would have to be reasonable.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case at bar, then, the assertion of the Tuttons that they believed a cure had been effected by Divine intervention and that insulin was not necessary for the preservation of the child's life would have to be considered by the jury.&nbsp; The jury would have to consider whether such belief was honest and whether it was reasonable.&nbsp; In this, they would be required to consider the whole background of the case.&nbsp; They would have to take into account the experience of the Tuttons with the child's illness;&nbsp; the fact that they had seen the result of the withdrawal of insulin on one occasion and that they had been informed of its necessity for the continued care of the child;&nbsp; and, that Mrs. Tutton had received some formal instruction or training in dealing with diabetes and diabetics.&nbsp; They would, as well, have to consider whether the belief in a miraculous cure leading to the conclusion that insulin and medical care were not required, though honest, was reasonable.&nbsp; Upon these facts and all others concerning the matter which were revealed in the evidence, the jury would be required to decide whether the refusal of insulin and medical attention represented a marked and significant departure from the standard to be observed by reasonably prudent parents.</span></p>
