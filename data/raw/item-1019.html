 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first ground of appeal requires a determination of what <i>Vetrovec</i> established.&nbsp; In <i>Vetrovec</i>, the appellants had been convicted at trial on a charge of conspiracy to traffic in heroin.&nbsp; An accomplice had testified for the Crown, and the trial judge warned the jury of the danger of convicting on the basis of uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.&nbsp; On appeal, the appellants did not object to this part of the trial judge's charge, but argued that the part of the charge dealing with the evidence that was capable of corroborative effect was improper.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of giving judgment for this Court, Dickson J. (as he then was) considered the traditional, "fixed and invariable" rule of law that a warning to the jury was automatically required on the evidence of an accomplice, and ultimately rejected that traditional rule in favour of a flexible, discretionary rule.&nbsp; Under the new rule, the trial judge has a discretion to determine whether the evidence of any witness -- not just accomplices -- is for some reason untrustworthy to such an extent that a warning to the jury is necessary.&nbsp; He stated at p. 823:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">All that can be established is that the testimony of some accomplices may be untrustworthy.&nbsp; But this can be said of many other categories of witness.&nbsp; There is nothing inherent in the evidence of an accomplice which automatically renders him untrustworthy.&nbsp; To construct a universal rule singling out accomplices, then, is to fasten upon this branch of the law of evidence a blind and empty formalism.&nbsp; Rather than attempting to pigeon-hole a witness into a category and then recite a ritualistic incantation, the trial judge might better direct his mind to the facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all the factors which might impair the worth of a particular witness.&nbsp; If, in his judgment, the credit of the witness is such that the jury should be cautioned, then he may instruct accordingly.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, he believes the witness to be trustworthy, then, regardless of whether the witness is technically an `accomplice' no warning is necessary.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Dickson J. later commented upon the practice that should be followed by trial judges in charging juries regarding untrustworthy witnesses (at pp. 831-832):</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Because of the infinite range of circumstance which will arise in the criminal trial process it is not sensible to attempt to compress into a rule, a formula, or a direction the concept of the need for prudent scrutiny of the testimony of any witness.&nbsp; What may be appropriate, however, in some circumstances, is a clear and sharp warning to attract the attention of the juror to the risks of adopting, without more, the evidence of the witness.&nbsp; There is no magic in the word corroboration, or indeed in any other comparable expression such as confirmation and support.&nbsp; The idea implied in those words may, however, in an appropriate case, be effectively and efficiently transmitted to the mind of the trier of fact.&nbsp; This may entail some illustration from the evidence of the particular case of the type of evidence, documentary or testimonial, which might be drawn upon by the juror in confirmation of the witness' testimony or some important part thereof.&nbsp; I do not wish to be taken as saying that such illustration must be carried to exhaustion.&nbsp; However, there is, in some circumstances, particularly in lengthy trials, the need for helpful direction on the question of sifting the evidence where guilt or innocence might, and probably will turn on the acceptance or rejection, belief or disbelief, of the evidence of one or more witnesses.</span></p>

Babinski</i> (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 187 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1992] 3 S.C.R. 467.&nbsp; In that case, it was held that if a trial judge decides to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning and there is evidence capable of corroborating the testimony of the witness in question, "the trial judge should make some reference to that supporting evidence" (Ont. C.A., at p. 190).&nbsp; The extent to which the trial judge should refer to potentially corroborative evidence depends upon the circumstances of the case, although it is obviously not required, nor would it be appropriate, that the potentially corroborative evidence be reviewed exhaustively.</span></p>

(as he then was) in <i>Vetrovec</i> at p. 823, "[t]o construct a universal rule singling out accomplices, then, is to fasten upon this branch of the law of evidence a blind and empty formalism".&nbsp; Rather, a trial judge now has the discretion to determine, after considering factors which might impair the worth of a witness, whether "the credit of the witness is such that the jury should be cautioned" (<i>Vetrovec</i>, at p. 823).</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Yanover</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300, at p. 324:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, no error was committed by the trial judge in the exercise of her discretion.&nbsp; I agree with Galligan J.A. that the effect of <i>Vetrovec</i> is to give trial judges a wide and flexible discretion as to how they instruct juries of the need for careful scrutiny of a witness' testimony.&nbsp; It is evident from the discussion that the judge had with counsel before the charge to the jury that she considered the propriety and need for a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution.&nbsp; While declining to do so, she nonetheless indicated that Dietrich's evidence required careful scrutiny and directed the jury to consider whether it was consistent with other credible evidence. In the circumstances, I would only restate the words of Galligan J.A., at p. 405, that:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">. . . the reviewing court must pay great deference to the trial judge's peculiar advantage in evaluating the atmosphere of a trial and in assessing whether or not, in all of the circumstances of a particular case, a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning would redound to the benefit or detriment of an accused.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning now to the alleged failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury regarding the use to be made of the prior inconsistent statements of Dietrich and Belmont, one must immediately point out that neither counsel objected to the judge's charge on that point, although objections were made on other points.&nbsp; The reason is quite obvious when one considers that those statements were put to the witnesses for the sole purpose of casting doubt on their credibility, never with the intention that they be adopted by the witnesses as evidence of the truth of their contents.&nbsp; Those witnesses were vigorously cross-examined and, in defence counsel's address to the jury, their statements were referred to on many occasions for the sole purpose of credibility.&nbsp; While failure to object would not of itself be fatal, the tactics of defence counsel cannot be overlooked.&nbsp; As I stated in <i>R. v. B. (F.F.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 713-14:&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">In this case, the failure of counsel to object indicates, in my view, that everybody took for granted that the purpose of introducing those prior statements was only to test the credibility of those witnesses.&nbsp; No one ever suggested otherwise.&nbsp; In the circumstances, it cannot be a matter of reproach to the trial judge that she took the case as it was presented and argued before the jury.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Further on counsel suggested:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
