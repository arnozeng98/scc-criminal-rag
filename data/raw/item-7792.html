The trial judge recalled the jury and gave a clarification using the correct language.&nbsp; In providing a limiting instruction to the jury in respect of P’s statement of fear of G, the trial judge told the jury the remark could be used to determine the state of mind of P shortly before his death, and to eliminate other potential people who would want to do P harm, as far as P was concerned.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; A new trial should be ordered on the basis of errors in the jury instructions on the burden of proof and of the trial judge’s admission of P’s out‑of‑court statement.&nbsp; The first deficiency in the charge on the burden of proof involved the explanation of how the standard of reasonable doubt applies to circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; Having chosen to elaborate on the basic principle that the jury could return a guilty verdict based on the circumstantial evidence if guilt was the only rational inference they could draw from the evidence, the trial judge should have said that if there was any other (as opposed to an “equally”) rational inference arising from the proven facts that did not point to guilt, the jury would be bound to acquit.&nbsp; Furthermore, in his response to the specific question from the jury as to whether feelings or intuitions could form the basis for reasonable doubt, the trial judge repeated three more times the incorrect component of this instruction, using the term “equally”.&nbsp; Because the jury was likely to have paid particular attention to the answer to their question, this would have amplified the misdirection.&nbsp; In order to ensure that a misdirection to the jury has been successfully rectified, a trial judge will generally have to repeat the direction he or she has given, acknowledge that it was incorrect, tell the jury to put it out of their minds and then tell them in plain and simple terms what the law is.&nbsp; The second deficiency arose in the trial judge’s instruction that the jurors should be able to explain in some detail the basis for any reasonable doubt they might have.&nbsp; While instructing a jury that they should be able to explain their doubts would not necessarily constitute reversible error, here the trial judge’s instructions went one step further, requiring the jury to be able to identify a specific reason for their doubt.&nbsp; In light of either of the uncorrected deficiencies in the charge on the burden of proof, and considering their combined effect in particular, it cannot be said that there is no reasonable possibility the jury was misled in this case.&nbsp; The error was serious.&nbsp; It may well have had significant consequences.&nbsp; The curative proviso under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> can therefore not be applied.&nbsp; [77‑80] [83‑87]</span></p>

Although the trial judge correctly instructed the jury on several occasions that, in order to base a verdict of guilt on circumstantial evidence, they had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused was the only reasonable inference that could be drawn, the trial judge elsewhere used language suggesting that an inference other than guilt would have to be “as reasonable” in order to lead to an acquittal.&nbsp; In the majority’s view, this language constituted legal error and the corrected instruction given to the jury during the course of their deliberations was insufficient to remedy any potential confusion.&nbsp; The majority further found that the error was compounded by “an excessively demanding instruction to motivate reasonable doubt” (para. 75) given in response to a question from the jury asking whether a reasonable doubt could be based on “feelings, intuitions, et cetera”.&nbsp; Côté J.A. disagreed on both points, finding no legal error.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">On the other hand, you should be able, also, if your position is, “I don’t have a reasonable doubt on this issue.&nbsp; I think the Crown has proved this essential element” to be able to explain it, to be able to say, “The reason I’ve arrived at that decision,” for example, “is that I accept the testimony of Witnesses A and B.&nbsp; I saw them testify.&nbsp; I saw the manner in which they testified.&nbsp; I find that there is confirmation of their testimony within the evidence.&nbsp; I also rely upon Exhibits X, Y and Z, because it adds -- the facts that I garnered out of Exhibits X, Y and Z, reinforce my opinion that the Crown has proved that particular essential element beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>

When the statement is tendered to prove the intentions of a third party, this danger is multiplied.&nbsp; If a declarant makes a statement about the intentions of a third party, there are three possible bases for this statement:&nbsp; first, it could be based on a prior conversation with the accused; second, it could be based on a prior conversation with a fourth party, who indicated the third party’s intentions to the declarant; or third, it could be based on pure speculation on the part of the declarant.&nbsp; Under the first scenario, the statement is double hearsay.&nbsp; Since each level of double hearsay must fall within an exception, or be admissible under the principled approach, the mere fact that the declarant is making a statement of present intention is insufficient to render it admissible.&nbsp; The second level of hearsay must also be admissible.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original deleted.]</p>

Whether you find there is a reasonable doubt, or whether you find there is not a reasonable doubt, you should individually be in a position to be able to explain your position. You should be able to say, for instance, “Listen, I have a reasonable doubt on this essential element, and here’s why I have a reasonable doubt. I can’t rely on Witness A and B. I don’t find Witness A and B credible. <u>And here’s why I don’t find Witness A and B credible, because there’s contradictions, or they’re not confirmed in the evidence, and I don’t accept that Exhibits X, Y and Z help me out on this particular issue</u>,” so that you’re able as a judge to explain why you are supporting a particular position.

One should first look to the traditional exceptions (<i>R. v. Mapara</i>, 2005 SCC 23, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 358), and then to the principled exception (<i>R. v.

Starr</i>, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144).&nbsp; The admissibility decision is also informed by the judge’s residual discretion to exclude evidence where its probative value is outweighed by the potential prejudicial effect (<i>R. v.

Cowell</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 4783 (QL) (S.C.J.), at paras. 71-74, illustrates this concern well:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The witness said: “she was afraid if she left him, he’d hurt himself”. The Crown seeks to admit this under the state of mind exception.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">Assuming that this statement is admissible as evidence of the state of mind of the victim, I am satisfied that its prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value. The difficulty with the statement is that it expresses the concern of the victim that the accused would hurt himself, without articulating any basis for that belief. That belief might be based on mere speculation. The Crown argues that there is other evidence that will provide support for the conclusion that the accused was planning to commit suicide. He borrowed money to pay off the substantial debt he owed to his parents, for example, showing he was getting his financial affairs in order. I have already mentioned the evidence found after the fact that is consistent with a suicide attempt having been made or, at least, contemplated.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">That evidence can be considered by the jury in deciding whether the accused did, indeed, intend to harm himself, but the baldly stated opinion of the victim that the accused might hurt himself if she left adds nothing of value to the evidence. It is the opinion of the jury, not the absent witness, that counts, particularly when the victim’s opinion might have been based on nothing more than speculation. Had she been alive to testify, she would not have been permitted to state her opinion as to what the accused might do if she left him, without articulating the factual basis for feeling that way.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:200%">While the jury could be permitted to use this evidence as indicating the state of mind of the victim at that time, there is a grave danger that the jury might misuse this evidence to infer that there was, indeed, good reason to believe the accused was suicidal, despite any limiting instruction I might give. That would be highly prejudicial to the accused. Since the state of mind of the victim one month before her death is only marginally probative, I conclude that the prejudicial impact of this evidence outweighs its probative value.</p>

line-height:200%">[103]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second theory fails for the same reason as the first: we are asked to use Poirier’s opinion to infer the state of mind of third parties, without having any idea of the basis for his conclusions.&nbsp; And using the statement to infer the state of mind of “others” is even more problematic than using it to infer the state of mind of Griffin, for four reasons.&nbsp; First, the “others” contemplated are not even identified.&nbsp; Second, the principal meaning of the statement seems to be that Poirier believed Griffin meant him harm, and it is not clear that he also thought that nobody else did.&nbsp; Third, the most one could infer is that the victim <i>lacked </i>any reason to believe that others wished him harm, which is even less helpful than an inference that he <i>did </i>have some reason to believe Griffin wished him harm.&nbsp; Fourth, and finally, if a hearsay statement can be permitted to help establish anybody’s state of mind, it should be that of the accused, because the accused is available to testify or bring evidence to contradict such an inference in court.&nbsp; Indeed this is one of the principal reasons that an exception to the rule against hearsay is made for party admissions (see J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 1999), at p. 287, <span style="font-family:&quot;WP Phonetic&quot;">_</span>6.292).&nbsp; Unidentified third parties, needless to say, do not have the same ability.&nbsp; For all of these reasons, the statement was not admissible to “eliminate” other potential suspects.</p>

line-height:200%">[104]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third conceivable use of the statement is to establish that Poirier was afraid of Griffin — in other words, to establish the state of mind of the <i>victim</i>.&nbsp; At first blush, this use would seem to fall within the scope of the “state of mind” exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; However, it is necessary to recall the basic principle: that evidence should&nbsp; only be admitted where it is relevant to an issue in the case.&nbsp; This principle applies equally to our concern.&nbsp; As Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant explain, “[i]f the mental state of the declarant is directly in issue at trial, then statements of his or her mental state are generally admissible in proof of the fact” (p. 256, <span style="font-family:
&quot;WP Phonetic&quot;">_</span>6.225).&nbsp; On the other hand, the state of mind of the victim is irrelevant unless it tends to support a permissible inference regarding a relevant fact.</p>

line-height:200%">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charron J. suggests (at para. 59) that Poirier’s fear of Griffin was relevant to Griffin’s motive, and in turn to the issue of identification.&nbsp; We agree that the statement “[i]f anything happens to me it’s your cousin’s family” can be understood not only as speculation, but also as an expression of fear, which is a state of mind.&nbsp; It could also be inferred that Poirier believed that Griffin had a motive to harm him.&nbsp; Again, however, we cannot be certain what basis Poirier may have had for such a belief, and therefore cannot rely upon this statement.&nbsp; With respect for those of a contrary opinion, we do not believe the statement is admissible under this theory.&nbsp; In this case, the victim’s state of mind is irrelevant on its own, and it is impermissible to use it to infer Griffin’s motive.</p>

line-height:200%">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings us to the fourth possible use of the statement: was it admissible to support other circumstantial evidence in the case?&nbsp; There was evidence suggesting that Poirier owed Griffin $100,000, that Poirier was unable to pay, and that Poirier was hiding from Griffin.&nbsp; This evidence related to the critical issue of motive.&nbsp; Poirier’s statement to Williams — “[i]f anything happens to me it’s your cousin’s family” — does tend to support these other facts.&nbsp; It was consistent with Poirier’s situation that he should have said what he did to his girlfriend.&nbsp; In the language of <i>Arp</i>, it “tend[s] to <span style="font-family:&quot;WP Phonetic&quot;">_</span>increase . . . the probability of the existence of a fact in issue<span style="font-family:&quot;WP Phonetic&quot;">_</span>” (para. 38).&nbsp; Under this theory, the statement is tendered not for the truth of its contents, but for the mere fact that it was made.&nbsp; It thus avoids the problem identified above, that the basis for the statement is not known.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:200%">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the statement could not be admitted under this theory either, because its probative value for this purpose is greatly outweighed by its potential prejudicial effect.&nbsp; As the respondent Griffin states, Poirier’s statement “begged to be used by the jury for the prohibited purpose” of inferring Griffin’s intent (Factum, at para. 82).&nbsp; When the jury hears “[i]f anything happens to me it’s your cousin’s family”, it is simply too tempting for the jury to reason that <span style="font-family:&quot;WP Phonetic&quot;">_</span>something happened: it must have been his cousin’s family<span style="font-family:&quot;WP Phonetic&quot;">_</span>.&nbsp; The statement could assume an almost superstitious significance.</p>

line-height:200%">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This great risk of prejudice could not be attenuated by a limiting instruction.&nbsp; It is difficult to justify admitting the statement for a marginally probative and tangential purpose while insisting that the jury not use it in the most obvious and prejudicial way possible.&nbsp; Numerous cases indicate that juries should be trusted to use evidence as directed:<i> R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at p. 692; <i>R. v. B. (F.F.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697;<i> R. v. W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742; <i>R. v. Spence</i>, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 22; and <i>Smith</i>.&nbsp; But there does come a point, as in this case, where one must heed Cardozo J.’s warning: “The reverberating clang of those accusatory words would drown all weaker sounds. It is for ordinary minds, and not for psychoanalysts, that our rules of evidence are framed” (<i>Shepard v. United States</i>, 290 U.S. 96 (1933), at p. 104).</p>

line-height:200%">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude therefore that it was wrong to have admitted the statement in the first place.&nbsp; This amounted to an error in principle, and deference cannot be accorded to the judge’s decision.&nbsp;</p>

Khan</i>, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 26, apply here.&nbsp; On the one hand, the decision to admit the statement cannot be characterized as “harmless”: Poirier’s fingering of Griffin from beyond the grave, so to speak, could only have had tremendous impact, despite the limiting instruction.&nbsp; Nor can the evidence against the accused be described as “so overwhelming that . . . there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice”.&nbsp; The Crown’s case rested in significant measure on circumstantial evidence and on the credibility of certain witnesses, and so we are not persuaded that no properly charged jury could have come to another verdict.</p>
