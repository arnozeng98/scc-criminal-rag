-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only issue raised at the accused's trial for rape was identification. Complainant, the only witness with respect to this issue, was attacked on a street shortly after midnight and dragged behind a shed where she was sexually assaulted. The incident took approximately twenty minutes. She testified that although it was dark behind the shed she was still able to see her assailant's face. She described him to the police on three different occasions with some minor variations. Two weeks after the attack, the complainant took part in a courtroom identification. She reacted visibly when she saw the accused and told the police that he looked like her assailant, but she was not sure because her view was obstructed by a sheriff. On a second courtroom identification two days later, she positively identified the accused as her assailant. She did so again at the preliminary hearing and at the trial. At the close of the Crown's case, the trial judge weighed and considered the quality of the evidence and granted a motion for a directed verdict. The majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial. This appeal is to determine whether the trial judge erred in directing a verdict of acquittal despite the fact that there was some evidence as to the identification of the accused. </span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Beetz, Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ.: In deciding whether to grant a motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge must determine "whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty". A trial judge is not entitled to withdraw a case from a jury where there is admissible evidence which could, if believed, result in a conviction, notwithstanding the frailties of the evidence. It is not the trial judge's function to weigh or consider the quality of the evidence. The weight that should be given to evidence, like questions of credibility, are matters for the jury only. In the case at bar, there was direct evidence of identification and the case should have been left to the jury with a proper caution.</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Dickson C.J. and Wilson J.: The governing test in Canada for a directed verdict is "whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty". This test may be susceptible of more than one interpretation, but an examination of its antecedents support the view that at this stage of the trial, the basis on which a trial judge can withdraw a case from the jury is extremely narrow. Although some cases suggest that the trial judge can direct a verdict only where there is no evidence at all, the words "no evidence", in this context, are not to be taken literally as meaning a total absence of evidence but rather as meaning no evidence capable of supporting a conviction.</span></p>

The substantial consistency in the complainant's description of the accused given on three separate occasions prior to any improper police procedures required him to put the evidence to the jury with a caution as to the inherent frailty of the identification evidence, coupled with an instruction to consider carefully the conditions under which the identification is made. A jury is in just as good a position as the trial judge to assess the witness' opportunity for observation and the strength of his evidence based on that opportunity. </span></p>

The conduct of the police lineâup, while irregular, was not so irregular by Canadian standards as to be beyond the capabilities of a jury, properly directed, to balance the overall strengths and weaknesses of her evidence against the prejudicial impact of the improper identification process and the difficulties inherent in the complainant's initial observation of her assailant.</span></p>

Thus, when applied to testimonial evidence, the test involves an assessment by the judge of the circumstances under which a witness makes his observations. These circumstances may undermine the reliability of the witness' accuracy.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case at bar, the trial judge did not err in directing a verdict of acquittal. It is clear from his reasons that he applied the proper test and that he addressed his mind to an assessment of the quality of the identification evidence. He found that the difficult conditions under which the observations were made and the improper identification procedures of the policeââprocedures that could tend to induce the witness into mistakenly identifying someoneââmade it too dangerous to rest a conviction on her testimony, honest as it might well have been.</span></p>

This did not raise a question of law alone in the Court of Appeal, and the Crown's appeal should have been dismissed.</span></p>

Although there is a considerable amount of jurisprudence on the test for a directed verdict, some confusion has been generated by the use of different terms to describe what may or may not be different tests. An examination of the existing authorities is, I believe, helpful in eliciting the proper principles.</span></p>

It would appear that the trial judge would have directed the verdict on either of these grounds. However, he clearly felt that the second ground reinforced his conclusion on the first and this is not surprising since the two are obviously linked. It would seem that the weaker the initial identification evidence the less impropriety it would take to undermine it totally. The stronger the initial identification evidence the higher the degree of subsequent impropriety it might take to undermine it.</span></p>

It is clear that Wright J. at trial felt that the complainant's testimony met the test of extreme insufficiency required for a directed verdict. What is unclear is whether this was because of the potential for inaccuracy in the complainant's initial observation of her assailant or because of the irregularities in her subsequent identification of Mr. Mezzo as the accused. Wright J. analyzed the problem before him in terms of the English Court of Appeal's decision in <i>R. v. Turnbull</i>, [1976] 3 All E.R. 549.

His failure to do so may have been due to the fact that he collapsed the issue of the quality of the initial identification with the issue of the effect of the improper police procedures. This seems to be the interpretation favoured by Matas J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal (1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 272. He expressed the view that Wright J. could not possibly have decided to direct a verdict on the basis of the complainant's initial identification evidence alone as that would be to take the principles in <i>Turnbull</i> too far.</span></p>

I think that the trial judge in the passage already quoted from his reasons did decide that the frailties of the initial identification evidence were reason enough for directing a verdict. He specifically states that "even where there has been a proper or adequate identity parade" the case must be taken from the jury. However, he went on to find that the "additional factor" of the improper police procedures "further damaged" the complainant's initial identification evidence. The question whether Wright J. erred in law in his assessment of the complainant's initial identification evidence is therefore validly raised. Indeed, as I hope to show in the ensuing analysis of the authorities, Wright J. erred in taking the case from the jury on this basis. The substantial consistency in the complainant's descriptions of the accused given on three separate occasions prior to any improper police procedures required him, in my view, to put the evidence to the jury with an appropriate caution.</span></p>

He thought that "the difficulty with the several descriptions furnished by the complainant was compounded by the improper showâup identifications" (p. 284). He concluded that it was impossible to say "if the complainant identified the accused on the second occasion only as the man she saw in court the first time or whether she was making a valid identification of the assailant" (p. 285). Accordingly, for this reason Matas J.A. thought that the only course open to the trial judge was to direct a verdict of acquittal.</span></p>

He considered that the identification evidence of the complainant should have gone to the jury for an assessment of its quality in light of the opportunity she had to see him provided proper directions were given by the trial judge. He found that the applicable principle was that enunciated in <i>R. v. Comba</i>, [1938] S.C.R. 396, and adopted by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Duhamel</i>, [1981] 1 W.W.R. 22, rather than that put forward in <i>Turnbull</i> which the trial judge had applied. In other words, the proper test in Hall J.A.'s view was whether in light of the "dubious nature of the evidence it would be unsafe to find the prisoner guilty". </span></p>

It is clear that in the present case the issue was not the credibility of the complainant but the quality of her evidence based on her opportunities for observation. However, I disagree with my colleague's view that " "quality" of evidence is truly the realm of the trial judge". A jury is in just as good a position as a trial judge to assess the witness' opportunity for observation and the strength of his or her evidence based on that opportunity. Indeed, this is something that lay people are peculiarly well equipped to do.</span></p>

C.A.), this Court had occasion to expand on the dual role of a trial judge sitting alone on a motion for a directed verdict. In support of the motion the defence had argued that the evidence adduced by the Crown should leave in the mind of the trial judge a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The trial judge proceeded to weigh the evidence in relation to the reasonable doubt standard and acquitted the accused. The Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal. However, Roach J.A. in dissent was of the view that the trial judge had no jurisdiction at this stage of the proceedings to consider the question of reasonable doubt. Rather, that question was for the jury or for the judge <i>qua</i> jury only after the defence had made its election to submit or not submit additional evidence and after that evidence, if any, was in. Roach J.A. described the limited nature of the trial judge's decision at this intermediate stage in terms of a choice between "evidence which...would justify a conviction" and "no evidence" as follows at pp. 215â16:</span></p>

I have recorded sufficient of the Crown's evidence to make it perfectly clear that as a matter of law if the accused was being tried by a Judge and jury, rather than by a Judge alone, the Judge would have had to leave the case to the consideration of the jury either to acquit or to convict. He could not have instructed the jury that there was no evidence and directed them to return a verdict of acquittal. </span></p>

Comba</i>, <i>supra</i>. In that case this Court set aside a jury verdict of guilt. Sir Lyman Duff C.J. stated, in effect, that cases comprised wholly of circumstantial evidence should be measured against the rule in <i>Hodgeâs Case</i> (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136. The rule states that where all the evidence is circumstantial the accused can be found guilty only if the evidence is both consistent with guilt and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. He also remarked that this would have been an appropriate case to direct a verdict of acquittal. A line of jurisprudence subsequently developed which incorporated the rule in <i>Hodgeâs Case</i> into the trial judge's deliberations on a motion for a directed verdict, thus creating an exception where circumstantial evidence was concerned to the narrow role of the judge at this stage of the trial.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The divergence of views on this point was not resolved until the mid 1970's. In <i>John v. The Queen</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 781, this Court stated that the rule in <i>Hodge's Case</i> was simply an elaboration of the reasonable doubt standard. The logical extension of this position occurred in <i>R. v. Paul</i>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181, and <i>Lavoie v. The Queen</i>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 193, cases in which this Court held that the rule in <i>Hodgeâs Case</i> and the question of reasonable doubt does not arise on a motion for a directed verdict. Although additional confusion has been generated by Ritchie J.'s seeming approval in <i>Shephard</i> of the notion that Sir Lyman Duff C.J. intended to create a special exception in <i>Comba</i>, I think his remarks must be read in light of the clear rejection only a few months later of the relevance of the <i>Hodge's Case</i> standard to directed verdicts in <i>Lavoie</i>, <i>supra</i>. Laskin C.J. wrote the judgment of a unanimous Court which included Ritchie J. and which reads in its entirety as follows at p. 193:</span></p>

As mentioned earlier, Roach J.A. of the Court of Appeal in <i>Morabito</i> spoke in terms of "no evidence" and several other decisions describe the directed verdict question as the "absence of evidence" question. Perhaps the strongest statement to this effect is by Pigeon J. in <i>R. v. Kyling</i>, [1970] S.C.R. 953. In the course of his reasons he stated at p. 955:</span></p>

It was rightly pointed out that whereas the absence of any evidence is a question of law, the insufficiency of the evidence is essentially a question of fact. The right of appeal by the prosecution, however, is only on a question of law. </span></p>

Morabito</i>, [1949] S.C.R. 172, establishes (i) that at that stage it was open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that whether or not there was such evidence is "a question of law alone" within the meaning of s. 1013(4) of the <i>Code</i>. I agree with this submission.</span></p>

-.15pt">Cartwright J.'s qualification of the appropriate standard in terms of whether a properly instructed jury might convict appears throughout the jurisprudence and is reflected by Ritchie J. in <i>Shephard</i>. Indeed, the link made by Ritchie J. in <i>Shephard</i> between the test for a directed verdict and that for sufficiency of evidence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec475" target="_blank">s. 475<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> supports the notion that "no evidence" represents a degree of quality rather than an absence of any evidence, good or bad. In addition, Ritchie J. in the course of his reasons gives some indication of the point at which poor quality evidence reaches that degree of extreme insufficiency. His implicit approval of the refusal to issue a warrant for extradition in <i>Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez</i>, [1973] F.C. 1206, provides a concrete illustration of identification evidence which is so dubious that a properly instructed jury could not reasonably convict. In that case, Thurlow J. (as he then was) of the Federal Court of Appeal described the evidence in question as follows at p. 1214:</span></p>

The evidence of the witness having selected the respondent's identification card is not in itself evidence implicating the respondent, and in the circumstances as described it tends to weaken rather than to strengthen the identification made by Atilano at the hearing ... Nor was there anything else to implicate the respondent or corroborate such identification.</span></p>

The use of the terms "no evidence" and "absence of evidence" at the very least imports a notion of constraint and stringency into the standard. However, I do agree with my colleague that Sir Lyman Duff C.J.'s direction in <i>Comba</i> with regard to the dubious nature of the evidence does not create a test of dubiousness which is separate and distinct from the test in <i>Shephard</i>. In my view <i>Comba</i> and <i>Shephard</i> are consistent with one another. Certainly this was the view of Ritchie J. in <i>Shephard</i>. He remarked on <i>Comba</i> at pp. 1081â82 as follows:</span></p>

It came from witnesses whose integrity was at no time put in question and who testified as to a variety of circumstances which had excited enough suspicion against the accused to occasion his arrest and trial but which taken together did not establish his guilt in accordance with the accepted standards of proof in such cases which are described by Duff C.J. ... </span></p>

As mentioned earlier, this causes some confusion over whether <i>Comba</i> imported the reasonable doubt standard into the test for a directed verdict in cases based on circumstantial evidence. In light of this Court's position in <i>Paul</i> and in <i>Lavoie,</i> it is my view that Ritchie J. in <i>Shephard</i> was using <i>Comba</i> simply to illustrate his point that poor quality evidence which merely raises a suspicion may legitimately be withheld from the jury in contraâdistinction to evidence that is poor in the sense of lacking in credibility. The question then is what content is to be given to Sir Lyman Duff C.J.'s concept of dubiousness or to Ritchie J.'s concept of a proper and reasonable basis for conviction. Can the content be articulated in a way that is useful without being overly cumbersome and inflexible?</span></p>

Again, I do not think that the controversy in this case stems from competing judicial tests. Apart from the question of Lord Widgery C.J.'s requirement of corroboration for poor quality evidence which does not arise here, I do not think there is such inconsistency between <i>Turnbull</i> and <i>Shephard</i> that they must be viewed as imposing different standards. In fact, <i>Turnbull</i> makes it quite clear that what is usually required in cases which turn on eyewitness testimony is a direction to the jury as to the inherent frailty of identification evidence coupled with an instruction to consider carefully the conditions under which the identification is made. Lord Widgery C.J. elaborated on the caution to be given as follows at p. 552:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

How long did the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance? In what light? Was the observation impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of people? Had the witness ever seen the accused before? How often? If only occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused? How long elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police? Was there any material discrepancy between the description of the accused given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and his actual appearance?</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After giving several examples of good quality evidence, Lord Widgery C.J. went on to suggest at p. 553 that where the quality is poor "as for example when it depends solely on a fleeting glance or on a longer observation made in difficult conditions", the trial judge should withdraw the case from the jury and direct a verdict of acquittal. Thus, at some point the adverse conditions for observation cannot be cured by a caution. Again this is consistent with Ritchie J.'s implicit approval of <i>Hernandez</i>. Unfortunately, Lord Widgery C.J. does not indicate, and it is perhaps impossible to do so, when the borderline is crossed. No one would take issue with the "fleeting glance" test; it represents the extreme of frailty which cannot be cured by a caution. The real difficulty is with "a longer observation made in difficult conditions". In this sense <i>Turnbull</i> is more significant for what it does not lay down. If it sets out any principle with regard to the test for a directed verdict, it is the principle that the quality of a witness' identification is directly related to the extent of the witness' opportunity for observation. However, <i>Turnbull</i> offers no workable criteria for determining when conditions are so difficult that an eyewitness' testimony should not be relied on or, in the language of the Canadian cases, when valid inferences become mere suspicions. The only guidance <i>Turnbull</i> gives is on the actual fact situation in <i>Turnbull</i> itself and in the accompanying appeals. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact situation in <i>Turnbull</i> is by and large unhelpful as the challenged evidence was recognition evidence and was supported by ample additional evidence. Accordingly, it passed Lord Widgery C.J.'s test and was found to have been properly put to the jury. In the other two appeals dealt with by the Court at the same time the convictions were quashed. However, they involved significantly worse conditions of observation than those in the present case and in this respect resemble the evidentiary basis in <i>Hernandez</i>. In <i>R. v. Roberts</i> the assailant was a stranger to the complainant, the attack was over in a few moments, the place of the attack was dark except for the flashing lights of the dance hall, the accused's subsequent conduct was consistent with his denial of guilt and there were significant contradictions in the descriptions of the identifying witnesses. In <i>R. v. Whitby</i> the identifications were of a man in a balaclava who had been seen for a short time during a robbery. One witness had seen him from the rear only; the other witness gave a completely inconsistent description before picking the accused out of a lineâup. There is very little one can point to in either of these cases which would redeem the obvious untrustworthiness of the identification evidence. Together with <i>Comba</i> and <i>Hernandez</i> they serve to delineate the line beyond which it would be improper in law to put the question of guilt or innocence to the jury. The case at hand requires that one delineate the opposite boundary, namely that beyond which it would be improper in law to withhold the question of culpability from the jury. I agree that within these broad parameters deference should in general be paid to the decision of the trial judge. Although the cases continually assert that whether there is an "absence of evidence" is a question of law upon which either party can appeal, this does not mean that the reviewing court should automatically intervene whenever it disagrees with the trial judge's assessment. However, unlike Lamer J., I do not believe that Wright J.'s assessment of the complainant's initial identification evidence falls within that area of deference.</span></p>

One can infer from the kinds of considerations enumerated in that case as going to the quality of identification evidence that, at the very least, the trial judge should address his or her mind to the same kind of considerations in determining whether or not to direct a verdict. In addition, it would seem to follow that where the frailties in the evidence can be remedied by a caution, the judge should leave the matter to the jury. This, indeed, is the ultimate test; can the frailties be remedied by an appropriate caution? It is not, in my view, good enough for a trial judge to make a finding as to the quality of the evidence. He must go on to determine whether the adverse conditions for observation can be taken care of by an appropriate caution. If they can, then Ritchie J.'s test of sufficiency in <i>Shephard</i> can be met, <i>i.e.</i>, there is "evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty" (p. 1080).</span></p>

The <i>Turnbull</i> caution does, however, identify a number of factors which can clearly affect the quality of eyewitness evidence: length of observation, distance, light, obstructions to view, recognition, time between original observation and subsequent description to the police and discrepancies between that description and the accused's appearance. No doubt there are many more. The consistency in the witness' descriptions (relevant in this case), his or her degree of attention and awareness at the time of the crime, and the witness' reaction at subsequent encounters with the accused (also relevant in this case) are some that come readily to mind. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case the evidence, apart from the suggestiveness of the courtroom identification, is dubious with regard to only two of the <i>Turnbull</i> factors, namely the poor lighting during most of the encounter and the fact that the assailant was a stranger to the complainant. These factors will be present in a large number of rape cases. I agree with Matas J.A. that we have to have regard to the realities of this particular offence. Wright J. seemed especially concerned by the lack of lighting. Admittedly in some circumstances, such as total darkness or the use of masks, a single factor by itself may require a directed verdict. However, it is clear from the <i>Turnbull</i> caution that imperfect or partial lighting does not always undermine accuracy. In my view, the question of whether or not it did so in this case should have been left to the jury. The complainant's first impression occurred under streetlights. The ensuing twenty minutes or so were in the dark but at close contact. The witness was fairly selfâpossessed a few hours later and was able at that point to give a general but coherent description. Her subsequent descriptions including the police portrait were for the most part consistent with that first description. In addition, she visibly reacted when later shown the accused in the course of a courtroom identification.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, except for the fact that her assailant was a stranger, the darkness behind the CN sheds, and several minor inconsistencies with regard to the length of hair and the fabric and length of the coat, the complainant's identification was detailed and coherent. It would be surprising indeed if such evidence was relegated to the category of mere suspicion and conjecture. The trial judge correctly focussed on the lighting as the crucial factor in relation to accuracy. However, I think that any weakness generated by the partially lit conditions was well within the ability of the jury to handle sensibly in combination with an appropriate caution. Any other interpretation would be inconsisÂ­tent with the scope and purpose of Lord Widgery C.J.'s comparatively detailed direction in this regard and with the stringency of the absence of evidence standard which underlies Ritchie J.'s test in <i>Shephard</i>. It follows that Wright J. could not have directed himself to these considerations and in particular to the question of whether the dubiousness generated by the poor lighting could be adequately addressed in a strongly worded caution. Thus, whether one regards Wright J.'s decision as flowing from a misunderstanding of <i>Turnbull</i> or as a failure to apply <i>Shephard</i>, the conclusion seems inescapable that he committed an error of law in directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis solely of the quality of the initial identification evidence.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have considered Wright J.'s assessment of the complainant's initial identification evidence in isolation from the issue of the possible detrimental impact on it of the subsequent improper police procedures. In practice, one could consider all the factors going to quality of the evidence together and only then apply the <i>Shephard</i> test with regard to the capacity of a properly instructed jury to convict on it. This was the approach taken by Matas J.A. For purposes of the present discussion I think it is helpful to proceed in two stages in order to clarify the considerations which are appropriate on a motion for a directed verdict. It will also be more efficient in a case such as this to take a twoâstep approach. Where the quality of a complainant's initial identification is so unreliable, <i>e.g.</i> the fleeting glance, that even with a strongly worded caution from the judge it could not support a verdict of guilt, there would be no need to go on to consider the impact of subsequent improper police procedures. However, where as in the present appeal, the initial identification evidence meets the test of sufficiency, the trial judge must, in my opinion, go on to the second stage and consider the impact on that evidence of the subsequent police procedures. </span></p>

Several features of it are relevant to the quality of the identification. Rather than place the accused in an identification parade the police brought the complainant to view a number of prisoners as they were brought into court. Mr. Mezzo was among them. There is no indication that this procedure was adopted because of the accused's refusal to participate in a proper parade or by urgency. The complainant knew the police had a suspect in custody. She reacted visibly when she saw Mr. Mezzo but, because her view was obstructed by the sheriff, she said that although Mr. Mezzo looked like the man she could not be certain. In addition, the police were unable to say whether Mr. Mezzo's name had been called, the charge read, or whether any of the other prisoners called at the same time looked like Mr. Mezzo. The problems in terms of evidential quality inherent in this first attempt to have the complainant identify her assailant are fairly obvious.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the complainant's uncertainty on this first lineâup, a second courtroom viewing was arranged at which Mr. Mezzo's name was definitely called out. This time the complainant positively identified Mr. Mezzo as her assailant. Matas J.A. comments that "It is impossible to say if the complainant identified the accused on the second occasion only as the man she saw in court the first time or whether she was making a valid identification of the assailant" (p. 285). He went on to say that the problem is magnified when it is coupled with the other factors of suggestiveness and the absence of Crown evidence on the particulars of the lineâup. Matas J.A. therefore agreed with the directed verdict of acquittal.</span></p>

Smierciak</i> (1946), 87 C.C.C. 175 in their assessment of the impact of the lineâup. The accused in that case was charged with attempting to pass a forged cheque by presenting it to a bank teller. When the teller asked for a registration card the accused searched his pockets and remarked that he must have left it in his car. He then walked out of the bank and did not return. Although the teller would not have taken any special care to observe the accused at the time of the transaction, the conditions for observation were very good. The police subsequently showed her a single photo of a suspect which she identified as the man. He was convicted. On appeal Laidlaw J.A. stated at p.&nbsp;177:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">In addition to such matters, and of the utmost importance, is the method used to recall or refresh the recollections of a witness who is to be relied upon to identify a person suspected of wrongdoing or who is under arrest. If a witness has no previous knowledge of the accused person so as to make him familiar with that person's appearance, the greatest care ought to be used to ensure the absolute independence and freedom of judgment of the witness. His recognition ought to proceed without suggestion, assistance or bias created directly or indirectly. Conversely, if the means employed to obtain evidence of identification involve any acts which might reasonably prejudice the accused, the value of the evidence may be partially or wholly destroyed. Anything which tends to convey to a witness that a person is suspected by the authorities, or is charged with an offence, is obviously prejudicial and wrongful. Submitting a prisoner alone for scrutiny after arrest is unfair and unjust. Likewise, permitting a witness to see a single photograph of a suspected person or of a prisoner, after arrest and before scrutiny, can have no other effect, in my opinion, than one of prejudice to such a person. </span></p>

Taken at its best we have here a fairly reliable initial identification followed by two improper and suggestive lineâups. However Laidlaw J.A.'s concern in <i>Smierciak</i>, <i>supra</i>, seems to be as much with prejudice to the accused as with the frailty of the complainant's evidence. He concludes that because of the prejudice arising from the police procedures it would be unfair and unsafe to convict. In contrast, it is the frailty of the evidence aspect that appears to have been foremost in the minds of both the trial judge and Matas J.A. in the present case. Indeed, Matas J.A. specifically states that it is not necessary to consider the issue of the exclusion of the evidence on the basis of either common law or constitutional fairness principles.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While suggestiveness and observational impediments may feature in both the frailty issue and the fairness issue, the two are approached from different standpoints and involve radically different policy concerns. Where the frailty or accuracy of the identification is under consideration, the standpoint is that of the complainant and of society. The underlying concerns are to redress the harm caused to her and to society by criminal behaviour and to ensure that the verdict is supported by proper evidence. Where fairness is at issue, the standpoint is that of the accused and the underlying concern is the affront to justice inherent in prejudicial and needlessly suggestive procedures. In spite of these conceptual differences, accuracy and unfairness are often treated as aspects of the same issue. This can in some instances be explained by the fact that ultimately the two standpoints converge. Obviously it would be unfair to convict an accused on frail evidence. In addition, where evidence is excluded for fairness reasons, the effect may be to render the remaining evidence frail. In the present appeal, the appellant has argued accuracy and fairness as separate points. I agree that they should be viewed as analytically distinct. The question whether evidence should be excluded is not properly part of the decision to direct a verdict except in the indirect sense mentioned above, namely where the exclusion effectively undermines the other perfectly acceptable evidence.</span></p>

Faryna</i> Huband J.A., with whom O'Sullivan J.A. concurred, was of the view that the use of an improper lineâup fatally weakened the Crown's case. As in the present appeal the entire case turned on eyewitness evidence. However, unlike the present appeal, the initial identifications given by the two complainants were extremely poor, consisting in one instance of two encounters lasting a total of ten seconds and in the other instance of one encounter lasting three seconds. In addition, subsequent descriptions given by the complainants had several inconsistencies and both picked the accused out of lineâups in which the persons in the line bore no resemblance to the accused. Huband J.A. distinguished <i>R. v. Smith, supra,</i> on the basis of the extraordinary frailty of the initial identifications of Mr. Faryna. He went on to describe the lineâup and its impact on the Crown's case as follows at pp. 195â96: </span></p>

Having identified the man so indicated as her assailant, there is a reasonable apprehension that her subsequent descriptions of her assailant, both at the preliminary inquiry and at trial, were based on impressions she formed of the man in the police lineup, rather than of the man she saw for fleeting seconds at the time of the assault. This is not to impute any ill motive to Mrs. Cudmore. It simply reflects the inherent danger in identification evidence of this type and highlights the reasons why police lineups must be conducted properly if any weight is to be given to the evidence obtained as a result.</span></p>

In <i>R. v. Sutton, supra,</i> Jessup J.A. ordered a new trial in part because the trial judge had failed to caution the jury with respect to the frailty generated by an improperly conducted photo lineâup. The implication is that those frailties could have been remeÂ­died by a proper direction. Likewise in R. v. Smith and <i>R. v. Engel, supra,</i> the respective Courts of Appeal were of the view that a caution to the trier of fact was all that was needed to counteract the damage caused by improper lineâup procedures.</span></p>

In support of this contention he referred to <i>Regina v. Spatola</i> (1970), 10 C.R.N.S. 143, <i>Rex v. Brown and Angus</i> (1951), 99 C.C.C. 141, <i>Rex v. Goldhar</i>, <i>Rex v.

I subscribe to what was said in all those cases but would point out that here Mr. Walker had ample opportunity of observing the facial features of the appellant enabling him to receive an impression of a definite cast of countenance. When the distinguishing red mark is added to this, in my opinion, it cannot be said that Mr. Walker could not visualize the personal characteristics and individuality of the appellant to the extent necessary to enable him to identify him late on the day of the robbery in the lineup. This being so, I would refer again to <i>Regina v. Spatola</i>, <i>supra</i>, wherein Laskin, J.A., said in effect that identification evidence is for the jury to evaluate on proper direction.</span></p>

The attempt occurred at night, albeit near a street light. The complainant spent the whole time trying to fight off her assailant. Afterwards she was able to give a description which generally corresponded to that of the accused except that she got the colour of his eyes wrong. The accused refused to participate in a lineâup. The police brought the complainant to a courtroom where he was appearing in connection with another offence. The accused entered the courtroom alone, handcuffed, and escorted by a constable. The complainant immediately began to shake and cry and was taken from the room. After she had calmed down she asked for another view in order to be sure. She was then taken back into the courtroom whereupon she positively identified the accused as her assailant.</span></p>

But you might also feel that you are entitled to overlook the unusual procedure, or at least not feel that it detracts from her identification when you consider Constable Anderson's very vivid description of how she reacted to seeing Simpson, saying "That's the man" or words to that effect. When you are looking at a man handcuffed, surrounded by police in a court room is one thing, but to react as Cathy did seems to me to be another thing, you may find, or you may not find. You may disagreeââyou may agree. You may think then that her reactions may be sufficient, or a sufficient act of identification which eliminates the problem of the method of bringing Simpson in and the fact he was handcuffed and with the police. That is one of the areas that you are going to have to make a decision upon.</span></p>

The parallels with the circumstances in <i>Mezzo</i> are quite striking. In both cases the initial encounter is under difficult conditions but the complainant's subsequent descriptions are consistent and fairly specific. If anything, the lineâup process in <i>Simpson</i> is more suggestive than that in <i>Mezzo</i>. In both cases there are two viewings and in both cases the witness has a physical reaction to the sight of the suspect.</span></p>

First, the improprieties in the lineâup do not necessarily destroy otherwise good evidence. Second, consistent with <i>Shephard</i>, damage can often be remedied by a proper caution. Third, at this stage of the analysis the assessment of the evidential basis for conviction depends not only on separate assessments of the weaknesses in the initial observation and the weaknesses in the conduct of the lineâup but also on the impact of one or the other. As I stated at the outset, the stronger the initial identification evidence the higher the degree of subsequent impropriety it might take to undermine it. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that the lineâup procedure employed in this case was not so irregular by Canadian standards as to be beyond the capabilities of the jury to weigh. Because of the failure of the Crown to record the particulars at the courtroom encounter one must assume that the viewings were tantamount to single showâups. However, in <i>Marcoux v. The Queen</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 763, a unanimous decision of this Court, single showâups were approved by implication, at least in so far as considerations of accuracy are concerned. The accused in that case refused to take part in a lineâup. The complainant who had awakened to find a robber in his hotel room in the early morning hours subsequently identified the accused in the hallway of a police station and a few minutes later in a room occupied by Mr. Marcoux and a police constable. At trial, the defence in a motion for a directed verdict vigorously attacked the failure of the police to conduct a proper lineâup. The trial judge refused the motion. On appeal to this Court the central issues were whether lineâups violated the privilege against selfâincrimination and whether evidence of an accused's refusal to participate in a lineâup is admissible. In the course of his reasons for the Court Dickson J. (as he then was) discussed the use of single showâups and inâdock identification. Although he did not make any specific finding with regard to Canadian law, he referred briefly to American and British judicial criticism of the failure to use a proper lineâup in the following passage at pp. 773â74:</span></p>

Ballott</i> (1967), 20 N.Y. 2d 600, have found the failure to employ a lineâup by the police, absent imperative circumstances, violative of due processââsee "<i>Preâtrial Identification</i>", (1971) 55 Minnesota Law Review 779, at p. 791. The Court of Criminal Appeal of England has commented adversely on the absence of an identification parade and failure to explain the omission to hold one: <i>R. v. Seiga</i>, [1961] Crim. L.R. 541. In <i>R. v. John</i> (unreported, abridged in (1973) Crim. L.R. 113), evidence was given by a detective constable that the accused had refused an identification parade. On appeal from conviction, it was urged, unsuccessfully, that the trial judge had wrongly allowed one of the witnesses to identify the accused in the dock when she had not identified him before the trial. Lord Justice Cairns, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:</span></p>

Leaving out altogether the question of whether or not it was reasonable for him to refuse an identification parade, the fact was that the Prosecution did not have that very much better method of identification available and, that being so, it does not appear to this Court to be wrong to allow that method of identification to be used by that witness, Miriam Baker.</span></p>

There is no suggestion that apart from due process considerations the potential for inaccuracy generated by the stationâhouse showâup rendered the evidence against Mr. Marcoux unsafe as a basis for conviction. The implication is that because Mr. Marcoux's refusal necessitated the showâup the fairness issue does not arise and that the trial judge properly put the evidence to the jury in spite of the problems in the quality of the initial observation and the subsequent identification. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present appeal the complainant's initial identification evidence, in my view, was such as to require the trial judge to put it to the jury with an appropriate caution. The conduct of the police lineâup was clearly improper but again, on the basis of authorities such as <i>Marcoux</i> and <i>Simpson</i>, not so improper as to be beyond the power of the jury to handle given a proper direction by the trial judge. I do not think the police lineâup had the effect of destroying the complainant's initial evidence or weakening it beyond the point where it could not be taken care of by a properly worded caution. Indeed, the visible reaction of the complainant to Mr. Mezzo was, if anything, supportive of her earlier testimony and her obvious desire to be sure before she made a positive identification in the courtroom bore witness to her good faith and credibility. Matas J.A. raises the possibility that all the complainant was doing in the second courtroom encounter was recognizing the person she had seen on the first encounter. With respect, I think this is to seriously underestimate a witness who had given a perfectly sensible and commendable reason for wanting to have an unobstructed view before committing herself. But these are, in my opinion, all matters for the jury to weigh once the judge has drawn them to its attention.</span></p>

The "imperative circumstances", namely the accused's refusal to participate in a proper lineâup, present in <i>Marcoux</i> and <i>Simpson</i>, are absent here. In addition the police by failing to record the particulars of the procedure have effectively made it impossible for the trial judge to caution the jury with respect to this portion of the evidence other than by advising them to assume the worst. In my view, these circumstances do raise a serious concern over prejudice to the accused. However, I believe that the proper context for that discussion would have been on a motion to exclude the evidence either on the basis of <i>R. v. Wray</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 272, and the accompanying jurisprudence or under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>. No such motion was made when the lineâup evidence was admitted at trial. Nor has the case been approached on that basis either by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

The trial judge was in error "not so much in adopting the wrong test but in misapplying the test in <i>Turnbull</i> to the facts of the case". He indicated that the preferable language to employ was that employed in <i>R. v. Comba,</i> [1938] S.C.R. 396. He set aside the directed verdict and ordered a new trial. Matas J.A., in dissent, set out the facts of the case clearly and completely. He reviewed many of the relevant authorities. He was concerned with the frailties of visual identification and procedures followed by the police in connection with the courtroom identification. He would have dismissed the Crown appeal.</span></p>

No authority need be cited for the proposition that in a jury trial all questions of law are for the judge alone and, of equal importance, all questions of fact are for the jury alone. The distinction is of fundamental importance. It should be preserved so long as it is considered right to continue the use of the jury in the criminal law. Much of the difficulty that has arisen on this subject has been caused by a failure to recognize and preserve this distinction. </span></p>

Shephard,</i> [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067. Ritchie J. wrote the majority judgment (Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de GrandprÃ© JJ.), while Spence J. dissented with the concurrence of Laskin C.J., Dickson and Beetz JJ. The United States applied for Shephard's extradition. The only evidence adduced before Hugessen J., sitting as an extradition judge, was an affidavit sworn by a coâconspirator of Shephard. Hugessen J. considered that he had to apply the test involved in taking a case away from a jury and, saying the evidence was "so manifestly unreliable", he declined to order extradition. An appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal was dismissed and the matter came to this Court. Ritchie J. agreed with the trial judge that the test to be applied was that expressed in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec475subsec1" target="_blank">s. 475(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>,</i> which is set out hereunder in its amended form:</span></p>

The conviction was quashed and the accused was acquitted. Middleton J.A. examined very closely the evidence led at trial. Before doing so, he referred to the rule in <i>Hodgeâs Case</i> and noted that it had been approved in this Court in <i>Fraser v. The King</i>, [1936] S.C.R. 1. He referred to Rinfret J.'s quotation of the rule in that case from Wills, <i>On Circumstantial Evidence</i>, in these terms: </span></p>

They all found that the evidence was as consistent with innocence as with guilt. Thus, it will be seen that <i>Comba</i>, as decided in the Ontario Court of Appeal, is a âno evidenceâ case and not inconsistent with the line of authority which culminates with Ritchie J. in <i>Shephard</i>. It is in this context that one must consider the words of Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in <i>Comba</i> in the Supreme Court of Canada. At page 397, he restated the test from <i>Hodgeâs Case</i> in these words:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict rests solely upon a basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the guilty person.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then concluded that the facts did not have the probative force required to satisfy the rule. He expressed agreement with the majority of the Court of Appeal, whose reasons he found convincing and conclusive, that the trial judge should have told the jury that "in view of the dubious nature of the evidence, it would be unsafe to find the prisoner guilty, and to have directed them to return a verdict of acquittal accordingly". These are the words that from time to time have caused uncertainties. It has been suggested that the use of the word `dubious' has given the trial judge a power or discretion to weigh and consider the quality of the evidence and to remove it from the jury's consideration. In my view, no such result occurred. The word `dubious', as used here, must be considered in the context of the whole case and, particularly, the judgment of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal which Sir Lyman Duff C.J. specifically approved. The evidence was dubious only because in the application of the test in <i>Hodge's Case</i> it cast the balance neither way. It led to no result and left no evidence upon which a conclusion could be based. It is evident then that like the Court of Appeal, this Court treated <i>Comba</i> as a `no evidence' case. It is then consistent with past authority. Accordingly, there is no authority from this Court which is inconsistent with <i>Shephard.</i> </span></p>

(2d) 338, the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal for the Yukon Territory held that, when faced with a motion for a directed verdict in a case dependent on circumstantial evidence, it was the duty of the trial judge to decide whether the evidence satisfied the rule in <i>Hodgeâs Case</i>. Only if it did, was the case to go to the jury for determination of guilt or innocence. In this sense a weighing process or an assessment of quality was contemplated on the part of the judge. Those cases, however, were effectively overruled in this Court in <i>R. v. Paul</i>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181, and <i>Lavoie v. The Queen</i>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 193, and even in circumstantial cases the law now is that any determination as to compliance with the rule in <i>Hodgeâs Case</i> would be left to the jury.</span></p>

Duhamel, supra</i>, and the English case of <i>R. v. Turnbull, supra</i>, upon which it is largely based. In <i>Turnbull</i>, Lord Widgery C.J., for the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division (Roskill, Lawton L.JJ., Cusack and May JJ.), stressed the dangers of injustice that can arise and in some cases have arisen because of errors made in visual identification of persons charged with crime. At the same time, he was at pains to make it clear that visual identification could not be eliminated as admissible evidence in criminal proceedings. He dwelt at length on the nature and scope of the directions which a trial judge should give to a jury which had to deal with evidence of visual identification, and he said that failure to give an adequate direction could result in convictions being quashed. In all, he was referring to what he described as the quality of the evidence. He said, at p. 552: </span></p>

-.15pt">It is impossible to disagree with Lord Widgery C.J. when he speaks of the danger of error in visual identification. Nobody could disagree with his assertion of the need for a careful and complete direction to the jury with regard to their treatment of such evidence. When, however, he introduces the suggestion that the trial judge should consider the quality of the evidence and, where he finds it wanting, take the case from the jury, he enters more controversial ground and authorizes the trial judge to encroach upon the jury's territory. Such a step blurs or even obliterates the clear line separating the functions of judge and jury. Questions of credibility and the weight that should be given to evidence are peculiarly the province of the jury. The term âqualityâ, as applied by Lord Widgery C.J., is really nothing more than a synonym for âweightâ. To consider it, the trial judge exceeds his function. I am fully aware that untruthfulness on the part of a witness is not the only factor which may render his evidence weak or even useless. The most honest witness may be mistaken or, by external interference or distraction or by lack of opportunity to observe, the value of his evidence may be diminished or even eliminated so that it should receive little if any weight. All these considerations affect the weight of the evidence and the jury, twelve indifferent persons who must be unanimous to convict the accused, may with a careful direction from the trial judge take account of all these relevant factors and reach a conclusion with at least as much reliability as a single judge.</span></p>

That time is now past and modern jurors represent a wellâeducated, wellâinformed and experienced crossâsection of our society. If it is unsafe to preserve in today's world the distinction between the functions of a judge and a jury, that fact would count as an argument for the entire abolition of the jury system rather than for a mere change in the law relating to the extent of the jury's role.

(The police officer noted this description of the assailant's hair because the complainant said that the hair came to the top of the assailant's ears.)

Further discussion between the artist and the complainant resulted in the sketch which was filed in court as Ex. 1.

He knew Mr. Mezzo well enough to know what he looked like and to identify him. He told the complainant that they would be doing a courtroom identification; she was to accompany him to the courtroom, where a number of persons would appear.

At about 10:45 a.m., when Mr. Mezzo, the fifth prisoner, came in and sat down, the police officer saw the complainant react visibly by shaking and moving from side to side. Mr. Mezzo was about 20 to 25 feet away from the complainant. He was in the courtroom about 90 seconds.

That test is set out in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec475" target="_blank">s. 475<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> as being whether "in his opinion the evidence is" (or is not) "sufficient to put the accused on trial". Before this Court's decision in <i>Shephard</i>, that test had been interpreted in three different ways: the probable guilt test, the <i>prima facie</i> case test where the judge cannot weigh the evidence at all to determine sufficiency, and the <i>prima facie</i> test where the judge does weigh the evidence.</span></p>

Rather, his discretion is, in the words of Chief Justice Duff, âwhether the evidence is of such a dubious nature as to be dangerousâ. In <i>Puerto Rico v. Hernandez</i>, <i>supra</i>, the evidence was dubious and dangerous to use as a basis for conviction because the witness purported to make observations which the learned trial judge believed were impossible. In the present case, the evidence is dangerous and dubious because it was given by a witness who was quite evidently acting in hope of a reward which had been promised to him in detail. I use Thurlow J.'s words in <i>Hernandez</i>, âI find it inconceivable that a person should be put on trial on such flimsy evidence ...â.</span></p>

Indeed, I find it inconceivable that a person should be put on trial on such flimsy evidence as a purported identification made a year after the event by a person who did not previously know the accused and whose only opportunity to observe him was a fleeting one from a distance of some sixty feet, if indeed he ever got that close. The evidence of the witness having selected the respondent's identification card is not in itself evidence implicating the respondent, and in the circumstances as described it tends to weaken rather than strengthen the identification made by Atilano at the hearing ... Nor was there anything else to implicate the respondent or corroborate such identification.</span></p>

In such cases, by the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the guilty person.</span></p>

If I am wrong in reading that distinction in Ritchie J.'s reasons, then I propose that this Court find that to be the proper test.

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">... if he is not satisfied that there is evidence on which reasonable men could act, he must not let the case go to the jury. Again, so stated, the rule might seem to be a commonplace. If there is not evidence upon which reasonable men could act, it must be immaterial whether the case is left to the jury or not since their verdict could only be negative. So the rule would be otiose were it not for the fact that judges and juries can take a different view of what reasonable men should think. When there is such a difference, it is not, as might be supposed, the view of the jury who <i>ex officio</i> are the reasonable men that prevails, but the view of the judge. This understood, the rule can be restated in its true terms: <u>the verdict cannot be supported unless a reasonable lawyer thinks that there is evidence upon which reasonable men could act.</u> There can be no doubt about the difference between the reasonable lawyer and the reasonable man. When twelve men unanimously return a certain verdict, they must believe that there is evidence to support it. When the judge rejects their verdict, he is not really telling them that not a single one among them is a reasonable man. What he is telling them is that there is a certain minimum of evidence which the law requires and that as a trained lawyer he is a better judge than they are of what that minimum should be. <u>What the minimum should be is not a question of law but a question for lawyers.</u></span></p>

The question would be: "Would it be unsafe to convict?" This would involve, given the particular nature of circumstantial evidence, asking whether innocence can be logically and reasonably excluded. Morris J. Fish, in "Committal for Trial: âSomeâ Evidence is Not<i> âSufficientâ&nbsp;" (1979), 39 R. du B.</i> 607, at p. 618, suggests the following test, which I would adopt:</span></p>

Finally, if innocence <i>can</i> be logically and reasonably excluded, the evidence is <i>sufficient</i> and may be considered by the trier of fact. Conviction will not automatically ensue. The trier of fact, it need hardly be repeated, will only convict if âconvinced <i>beyond a reasonable doubt</i> that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable explanation of the facts established by the evidenceâ.</span></p>

The reliability of the witness' accuracy may be undermined by the circumstances under which the witness was called upon to register what he later on relates in the belief that it was and still is accurate. This might be, when considering the accuracy of identification testimony, the fact that the witness had only "a fleeting glance", or had a "longer observation" but one "made in difficult circumstances"; or again the result of improper police identification proceedings that would tend to induce the witness into mistakingly identifying someone.</span></p>

The only difference in my view between the majority and the minority in <i>Shephard</i> is whether the judge can assess the truthfulness of witnesses when assessing whether there is sufficient evidence. With respect, I fail to see any essential difference between the test expressed in <i>Comba</i>, and that expressed by the majority in <i>Shephard</i>. The <i>Comba</i> formulation focuses on the nature of the evidence (dubious) and the resulting <i>unsafe</i> conviction, while the <i>Shephard</i> test focuses on the unreasonableness of the jury in founding a guilty verdict on the evidence of a given case. A reasonable jury that was properly instructed (the <i>Shephard</i> test), would never return a verdict of guilty "where the only evidence is of such dubious nature" that the verdict of guilty would be "unsafe" (the <i>Comba</i> test). I personally prefer the <i>Shephard</i> formulation of the test. It is expressed in terms that apply to all kinds of evidence while the <i>Comba</i> formulation more easily befits the kind of assessment one would make when considering circumstantial evidence. What really divided the Court in <i>Shephard</i> when assessing the quality of the evidence was the fact that the minority was of the view that the judge could, whatever the formulation of the test, consider the affiant's honesty while the majority found that he could not. Now to come back to this case. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge's decision to grant the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal rested on the finding that the identification evidence was of too poor a quality to be relied upon. This finding as regards the quality of that evidence is the resultant of two other findings of fact: the difficult conditions under which the victim made her observations as regards the identity of her aggressor and the improper police identification procedures. He assumed she was being truthful and withdrew the case because it was too dangerous to rest a conviction on her testimony, honest as it might well have been. This I conclude from a general reading of his reasons given in Court to the parties in the absence of the jury, and more particularly the following passage:</span></p>

Duhamel</i>, 1981, 1 W.W.R., 22 wherein Mr. Justice Harradence quotes approvingly and at length from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in <i>R. v. Turnbull</i>, 1976, 3 All England Reports, 549. In particular I refer to pages 28 and 29 of the Duhamel judgement wherein Mr. Justice Harradence sets out the principles expressed in Turnbull relative to the potential for miscarriage of justice based on visual identification. Towards the end of the statement of those principles the following declaration is made and I would say is made in no uncertain terms:</span></p>

If the quality is good and remains good at the close of the accused's case, the danger of a mistaken identification is lessened: but the poorer the quality, the greater the danger. In our judgment, when the quality is good, as for example when the identification is made after a long period of observation, or in satisfactory conditions by a relative, a neighbour, a close friend, a workmate and the like, the jury can safely be left to assess the value of the identifying evidence even though there is no other evidence to support it; provided always, however, that an adequate warning has been given about the special need for caution.Were the courts to adjudge otherwise, affronts to justice would frequently occur."</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear from this passage that the judge was addressing his mind to an assessment of the <i>quality</i> of the identification evidence. With "quality" in mind, he then considered the circumstances of the observation and the police identification procedures. As regards the conditions under which the observations were made, he said:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Now, it appears to me that it follows from this statement that where the evidence of identification is dependent solely on a witness who had no previous knowledge of an accused person and whose opportunity for observation has been in difficult circumstances, that evidence, in the view of the English Court of Appeal, cannot be safely left with the jury.</span></p>

The complainant had only a very limited and restrictive opportunity to observe her assailant. Although she may have been in his presence for as long as 20 minutes, the circumstances were such that her observations of the assailant were made in very difficult conditions. The place where she was first apprehended provided minimum lighting and the place behind the CNR shed where the attack proceeded and where it is evident most of the 20 minutes, if it was that, was spent, was very dark indeed. The complainant's description of her assailant, although matching the accused in many respects, is, nevertheless, one that could match any number of persons and contains no special identifying characteristics. I have concluded that these facts fall squarely within the directions in Turnbull, approved by the Alberta Court of Appeal, and even where there has been a proper or adequate identity parade, require that the case be taken from the jury.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">... of the utmost importance, is the method used to recall or refresh the recollections of a witness who is to be relied upon to identify a person suspected of wrongdoing or who is under arrest. If a witness has no previous knowledge of the accused person so as to make him familiar with that person's appearance, the greatest care ought to be used to ensure the absolute independence and freedom of judgment of the witness. His recognition ought to proceed without suggestion, assistance or bias created directly or indirectly. Conversely, if the means employed to obtain evidence of identification involve any acts which might reasonably prejudice the accused, <u>the value of the evidence may be partially or wholly destroyed</u>. Anything which tends to convey to a witness that a person is suspected by the authorities, or is charged with an offence, is obviously prejudicial and wrongful. Submitting a prisoner alone for scrutiny after arrest is unfair and unjust.</span></p>

Many crimes of violence, for example, rape or robbery, are committed in the absence of a witness other than the victim and in the absence of independent corroborating evidence. And it would be rare if the circumstances of the offence would not be difficult. Depending on the circumstances of the case, it may be that the only just course would be to direct a verdict of acquittal, as I think it was here. But the decision to direct a verdict of acquittal must depend on the circumstances of the case.</span></p>

But the essence of their decision was different and is found at p. 277 where Hall J.A., writing for himself and Monnin C.J., stated that the error of law committed by the trial judge was the misapplication of the proper test to the facts of the case.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is very easy to attribute to evidence the quality of being dubious, and therefore a view to that effect should be arrived at with restraint and not lightly if we are to have due regard for the process of trial by jury. In my view, the evidence of identification in the present case was sufficient for the jury to have passed on it after proper directions and instructions by the presiding judge. In that respect, the error of law of the trial judge was not so much in adopting the wrong test but in misapplying the test in <i>Turnbull, supra</i>, to the facts of the case. The preferable language to employ is that set out in <i>Comba, supra</i>, and adopted in <i>Duhamel, supra</i>.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears to me, when reading all of Wright J.'s reasons, that he applied the proper test, found the quality of the evidence such that it would be unsafe to rest a conviction upon it, and directed a verdict of acquittal. The manner in which he referred to "the fleeting glance" and "difficult conditions" situations offers some footing for the conclusion that he turned the examples into a test. But the context in which these references were made was one where he specifically referred in general terms to the "quality" of the identification as being the purpose of the scrutiny. Added to that is the fact that it is obviously the "quality test" that was on his mind when he addressed the question whether the improper police procedure had "partially or wholly destroyed" the "value of the evidence". The majority of the Court of Appeal found that it would not have been unsafe to convict, while Matas J.A. shared the trial judge's view that it would. This did not in my view raise a question of law alone in the Court of Appeal, and the Crown's appeal should have been dismissed.</span></p>
