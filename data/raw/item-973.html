 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reformed rule must carefully balance the accused's interests in a criminal trial with the interests of society in seeing justice done.&nbsp; Since the orthodox rule is an incarnation of the hearsay rule, a reformed rule must also deal with the "hearsay dangers" of admitting prior inconsistent statements for the truth of their contents ‚Äë‚Äë namely, the absence of an oath or solemn affirmation when the statement was made, the inability of the trier of fact to assess the demeanour, and therefore the credibility, of the declarant when the statement was made, and the lack of contemporaneous cross‚Äëexamination by the opponent.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this Court's decisions in <i>Khan</i> and <i>Smith</i>, evidence of prior inconsistent statements of a witness other than an accused should be substantively admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles being the reliability of the evidence and its necessity.&nbsp; These criteria, however, must be adapted to the present context.&nbsp; As a threshold matter, the prior inconsistent statements will only be admissible if they would have been admissible as the witness's sole testimony, lest what would be excluded as the witness's primary evidence be admitted under the reformed rule simply because the witness has recanted.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

That reliability will depend on a number of factors, among others, whether the witness giving the statement is subject to criminal prosecution for making a deliberately false statement.&nbsp; The less stringent requirements for prosecution for offences like obstructing justice, fabricating evidence or public mischief, which, unlike perjury, do not require corroboration, and the more frequent prosecutions for these offences would have a better deterrent effect upon those who might be prone to make false statements.&nbsp; A requirement that the police administer an oath to the witness cannot further deter the witness from lying and seems to be superfluous.&nbsp; Liability for these offences does not rest in any way on the oath and a witness cannot be found guilty of perjury arising from a sworn declaration made in the course of a criminal investigation.&nbsp; The absence of the oath should thus not presumptively stand in the way of the admissibility for substantive purposes of a prior inconsistent statement. Although it would be preferable to give a warning to a witness of the possibility of criminal proceedings if that person gives a false statement, it may not be essential to give such a warning in order to render the statement admissible.&nbsp; Canadians are well aware and indeed expect that witnesses who make deliberately false statements to the police would be subject to criminal prosecution.</span></p>

It is not essential, however, that a statement be videotaped in order to be admissible. Where a complete and comprehensive record of the statement is preserved together with satisfactory evidence of the circumstances of the interview and the demeanour of the witness all the requirements on this count will be met.&nbsp; If the prior statement, while not videotaped, meets all the criteria of reliability it should be admissible.</span></p>

In assessing the statement, the jury should take into account all the circumstances in which it was made and should be instructed that they may consider that the statement should be given less weight because it was not subject to cross‚Äëexamination at the time it was made and because there was not the same opportunity to assess the demeanour of the witness as there would have been had the statement been made in court.</span></p>

Beckett</i> (1833), 1 M. &amp; Rob. 414, 174 E.R. 143, at p. 145 E.R.:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Estey J. noted that courts continued to apply this rule after the enactment of <i>The Common Law Procedure Act, 1854</i> (U.K.), 17 &amp; 18 Vict., c. 125, s. 22, and its criminal law parallel in S.C. 1869, c. 29, s. 68, which have survived in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec9subsec1" target="_blank">s. 9(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.&nbsp; However, Estey J. also observed that the rule was not unchallenged in the 19th century.&nbsp; In <i>Attorney General v. Hitchcock</i> (1847), 16 L.J. Ex. 259, at p. 261, Pollock C.B., Parke B. concurring, said:</span></p>

Duckworth</i> (1916), 26 C.C.C. 314 (Ont. S.C., App. Div.), in which the court affirmed the orthodox rule of limited admissibility by a 4 to 1 margin.&nbsp; For the majority, Clute J. characterized the Crown's suggestion that evidence of prior inconsistent statements by Crown witnesses who recanted should be substantively admissible as (at p. 324) a rather "startling proposition and one to which I cannot accede except upon the clearest authority.&nbsp; None has been cited."&nbsp;&nbsp; Clute J. further said of s. 9 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1906, c. 145, that (at p. 329):</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

(Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ. concurring) held that the Court of Appeal had misconstrued s. 9(2) as requiring the witness to be adverse, when in fact all the trial judge was required to do under the section was to determine whether the previous statement in writing or reduced to writing was in fact inconsistent with the witness's present testimony.&nbsp; Martland J. was of the opinion that there was a clear inconsistency in the witness's testimony and that the trial judge had correctly exercised his discretion.&nbsp; Furthermore, Martland J. noted (at p. 605) that "[t]he trial judge was careful to explain ... the limited extent to which that cross-examination might be considered by the jury."</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The author cites as rare examples of Canadian judges explicitly recognizing the hearsay rule as the basis of the orthodox rule the reasons of Riddell J. in <i>Duckworth</i>, and Estey J. in <i>McInroy</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Evidence:&nbsp; Principles and Problems</i> (2nd ed. 1989), at p. 247, R.

W. Morden (now Morden A.C.J. of the Ontario Court of Appeal), "Evidence -- Proof of Own Witness's Prior Inconsistent Statement Where "Adverse" -- Section 24, Evidence Act (Ont.)" (1962), 40 <i>Can.

F. Dugdale, "Against oath-taking", [1985] <i>N.Z.L.J.</i> 404).&nbsp; Furthermore, commentators argue that the witness is under oath at trial when he or she is asked to adopt or deny the prior statement, thus invoking the power of the oath at the trial as it relates to the truthfulness of the prior statement.&nbsp; However, I note that while the witness faces the legal consequences of violating an oath or solemn affirmation at trial, in most cases there is less incentive to be truthful when the statement is made, leading to a natural preference for the testimony at trial if the alternative is unsworn or unaffirmed testimony.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Critics assert that there is a greater opportunity for coercion, intimidation and fabrication in the time between the taking of the statement and the trial than when the statement was made closer to the time of the events described.&nbsp; Proponents of the orthodox rule point to the time between the events described and when the statement was made as presenting opportunities for identical coercion and intimidation, and assert that later coercion may be directed towards convincing the witness to tell the truth at trial.&nbsp; It is clear that statements are neither more nor less likely to be true based solely on a consideration of when they were made.</span></p>

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1965] A.C. 1001 (H.L.), at p. 1047, that "[t]he common law is moulded by the judges and it is still their province to adapt it from time to time so as to make it serve the interests of those it binds" (p. 931).&nbsp; Significantly, <i>Myers</i> was a decision in which a majority of the House of Lords refused to create a new hearsay exception relating to business records, leading to a legislative response overcoming the decision.</span></p>

Olafson</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750, at p. 760), and only "those incremental changes which are necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric of our society" (Iacobucci J. in <i>R. v. Salituro</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at p. 670), it is important to assess the change in the correct frame of reference.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">What is important, in my view, is the departure signalled by <i>Khan</i> from a view of hearsay characterized by a general prohibition on the reception of such evidence, subject to a limited number of defined categorical exceptions, and a movement towards an approach governed by the principles which underlie the rule and its exceptions alike.&nbsp; The movement towards a flexible approach was motivated by the realization that, as a general rule, reliable evidence ought not to be excluded simply because it cannot be tested by cross-examination.</span></p>

Beckett</i>, <i>Duckworth</i>, or <i>Deacon</i> were decided, prior statements can be placed before the trier of fact in their entirety and in a form which ensures their integrity.&nbsp; This change has significantly undermined the "presence" rationale for the orthodox rule.</span></p>

Williams</i> (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 321, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1985] 1 S.C.R. xiv, Martin J.A. for the Ontario Court of Appeal stated, at p. 341, that "[g]enerally speaking, the accused, rather than the Crown, is the beneficiary of the rule that prior inconsistent statements of a witness (unless adopted by him in his evidence) are not evidence of the facts contained in them."&nbsp; This is because the Crown bears the burden of leading evidence, much of which will be based on police interviews with potential witnesses, leading to a greater likelihood that a Crown witness will recant and allow the Crown to take advantage of a reformed rule.&nbsp; The accused and his counsel will not often have the same access to witnesses to collect prior statements, and may not in fact lead evidence at all.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do not think that it can be conclusively stated that a reformed rule would necessarily broaden the scope of criminal liability in the sense intended by Dickson C.J. in <i>Bernard</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Bernard</i>, at pp. 860-61, Dickson C.J. wrote of the fourth guideline:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Respect for the principle of certainty and the institutional limits imposed upon the law-making function of the courts should constrain the Court from overruling a prior decision where the effect would be to expand criminal liability.&nbsp; It is not for the courts to create new offences, or to broaden the net of liability, particularly as changes in the law through judicial decision operate retrospectively.&nbsp; The same argument does not apply, however, where the result of overruling a prior decision is to establish a rule favourable to the accused.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Thus, it can be seen that Dickson C.J. was speaking of a more causally direct expansion of criminal liability; for example, in <i>Bernard</i> by reconsidering the effect of drunkenness on criminal liability, and in <i>Chaulk</i> by reconsidering the meaning of insanity.&nbsp; Merely admitting substantive evidence which will more often perhaps, incriminate the accused than it will exculpate the accused does not, in my view, expand criminal liability in the sense intended by Dickson C.J. in <i>Bernard</i>.&nbsp; To enable the Crown to secure more convictions with a new evidentiary rule expanding the scope of admissibility is not to expand the scope of criminal liability; it is, rather, to find more criminals liable.&nbsp; It cannot be said that the accused has any "certainty" interest in the orthodox rule, unless one considers the situation where the accused convinces a Crown witness to recant, secure in the knowledge that the prior statement will not be substantively admissible.&nbsp; This is not a result that the value of certainty is intended to promote.&nbsp; In addition, the courts are not institutionally limited from adjusting common law rules, as I have stated above, the same way they are from making wholesale changes to the elements of substantive offences.&nbsp; While it may be true that prior inconsistent statements will more often be tendered by the Crown, this is not to say that such statements will always be believed by the trier of fact in preference to the witnesses' present testimony.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the witness's prior statement merely repeated the direct evidence of another person ("X said he saw Y fire the gun"), such a statement, even when made with circumstantial guarantees of reliability, will not be substantively admissible for the truth of the evidence of that other person:&nbsp; because the statement is naked hearsay if offered to prove the fact that Y fired the gun, it would not have been admissible to prove that fact (absent a hearsay exception) as direct evidence from the testifying witness, and it does not become admissible evidence to prove that fact through the operation of the reformed rule.&nbsp; The only use that can be made of such prior statements is as proof that the statement was made to the witness, but not, obviously, as proof that Y fired the gun.&nbsp; This is no more than the hearsay rule applied to the prior statement as if it was evidence tendered at trial.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final possibility in this category is the present case ("Y told me he fired the gun"), in which the statement relates hearsay which is admissible under an established hearsay exception:&nbsp; while the statement repeats the evidence of another person, as in the second example, the hearsay exception applicable to the reported statement because it is an admission applies to the prior statement, again, as if the prior statement itself had been the witness's sole testimony.&nbsp; Because of the circumstantial guarantees of reliability attaching to admissions (on the assumption that an accused would not falsely incriminate himself), the hearsay statement may be admitted to prove the fact that Y fired the gun.&nbsp; But it is crucial that the matters in the prior statement would have been admissible if offered as the witness's sole testimony.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Broyles</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595.&nbsp; For the Court, Iacobucci J. held that the right to silence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> was engaged only when the accused was detained, and that the right to silence would be violated when a person acting as an agent of the state, but who is not obviously a state agent in the eyes of the accused, elicits a statement from the accused.&nbsp; Evidence so obtained in violation of the accused's right to silence would then be subject to exclusion under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, and with respect to the first of the factors enumerated in <i>R. v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, Iacobucci J. held (at p. 618) that "the fact that evidence is obtained by conscripting the accused against himself or herself will generally be sufficient to render the trial unfair".&nbsp; The other factors (seriousness of the violation, and the effect of excluding the evidence) would also have to be considered, but the first factor may well be determinative.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Barker</i> (1744), 1 Atk. 21, 26 E.R. 15, Willes L.C.J. stated, at p. 31 E.R.:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Similarly, Lord Hardwicke L.C. referred (at p. 32 E.R.) to the oath as "an appeal to the Supreme Being, as thinking him the rewarder of truth, and avenger of falsehood".&nbsp; The difference between sworn and unsworn evidence was therefore crucial, and the absence of an oath when the prior statement was made was an important obstacle to admitting prior inconsistent statements for their truth.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We no longer require this belief in divine retribution; in <i>Reference re Truscott</i>, [1967] S.C.R. 309, at p. 368, this Court stated in the context of child witnesses that the witness need only understand "the moral obligation of telling the truth".&nbsp; In this sense the oath can be said to have a changed significance, and if critics of the oath suggest only that its original supernatural force has disappeared, I agree with that observation.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.&nbsp; Furthermore, with the Court's decision in this case, prior statements which satisfy the criteria of admissibility will be used as substantive evidence in a subsequent trial; as a result, a witness who makes a false statement will also be liable to prosecution under s. 137 (fabricating evidence), once he or she is informed that the statement can, and indeed <u>will</u>, be used at trial if he or she recants.&nbsp; Finally, it may well be that, in light of this decision, Parliament will wish to extend other criminal sanctions (such as the offence of perjury, for example) to one who lies under oath, solemn affirmation or solemn declaration in the course of a criminal investigation.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Green</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 159:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">... the inability to cross-examine the witness at the time he made his prior statement cannot easily be shown to be of crucial significance as long as the defendant is assured of full and effective cross-examination at the time of trial.&nbsp; The most successful cross-examination at the time the prior statement was made could hardly hope to accomplish more than has already been accomplished by the fact that the witness is now telling a different, inconsistent story, and -- in this case -- one that is favorable to the defendant.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, unlike the oath and presence, it is the hearsay danger which is impossible to address outside of judicial or quasi-judicial processes.&nbsp; Whereas the police can easily administer a warning and oath, and videotape a statement in the course of a witness interview, it would restrict the operation of a reformed rule to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings to require contemporaneous cross-examination, and thereby severely restrict the impact of a reformed rule.&nbsp; Consider the facts of the present case:&nbsp; when the three witnesses were interviewed by the police, no one had yet been charged with an offence.&nbsp; Who could have cross-examined the witnesses at that point?&nbsp; How could cross-examination have been effective before the case to be met was known?&nbsp; These and other practical difficulties in requiring contemporaneous cross-examination tip the balance in favour of allowing cross-examination at trial to serve as a substitute.&nbsp; Again, we must remember that the question is not whether it would have been preferable to have had the benefit of contemporaneous cross-examination, but whether the absence of such cross-examination is a sufficient reason to keep the statement from the jury as substantive evidence.&nbsp; Given the other guarantees of trustworthiness, I do not think that it should be allowed to be a barrier to substantive admissibility.&nbsp; Of course, it will be an important consideration for the trier of fact in deciding what weight to attach to the prior inconsistent statement, and it is likely that opposing counsel will stress the absence of such cross-examination to the trier of fact.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">As an example of the second type of necessity, many established hearsay exceptions do not rely on the unavailability of the witness.&nbsp; Some examples include admissions, present sense impressions and business records.&nbsp; This is because there are very high circumstantial guarantees of reliability attached to such statements, offsetting that fact that only expediency or convenience militate in favour of admitting the evidence.</span></p>

Venner</i>, [1970] S.C.R. 608, for example, nurses' records were admitted as evidence at a medical negligence trial.&nbsp; The nurses, though present in court through the trial, were not called as witnesses.&nbsp; The Alberta Court of Appeal ordered a new trial, on the basis that Wigmore's necessity ground for the admission of hearsay was not satisfied since the nurses were available to testify.&nbsp; This Court allowed an appeal from this decision, holding at p. 626 that:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The Court made no reference to the present availability of the nurses as it related to the admissibility of the hearsay evidence, except to note their presence in court meant that the defendant could have challenged the accuracy of the notes if he had so wished.&nbsp; Similarly, the maker of the prior inconsistent statement is present in court as a witness to be examined and cross-examined as to the accuracy of the recording of the statement.&nbsp; <i>Ares v. Venner</i> stands as an example of a judicially-created hearsay exception which did not require unavailability.&nbsp; While the decisions in <i>Khan</i> and <i>Smith</i> established that Canadian courts will no longer carve out categorical "exceptions", the new approach shares the same principled basis as the existing exceptions.</span></p>

College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</i> (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 641, the Ontario Court of Appeal returned to the incident which led to this Court's decision in <i>R. v. Khan</i>.&nbsp; The disciplinary hearing took place some four years after the initial incident, at which time the child complainant was old enough to testify.&nbsp; However, the committee also heard evidence from the complainant's mother and other persons to whom the complainant had described the assault.&nbsp; The Ontario Court of Appeal held that this was not an error, since the interval between the time of the assault and the time of the disciplinary hearing meant that the complainant's ability to recall and recount the assault had deteriorated, compared to her statements immediately after the incident.&nbsp; Thus, the court held that the testimony of certain of the witnesses to whom the complainant described the assault was admissible under the <i>Khan</i> test, since it was "reasonably necessary" in the circumstances, and (at p. 655) "[a] rule which would automatically exclude the out-of-court statement where the child testifies is inconsistent with <i>Ares v. Venner</i>, <i>supra</i>, the authority relied on in <i>Khan</i>."</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 696, I wrote that even if the <i>Ibrahim</i> test was satisfied to make a confession admissible, such a confession "shall nevertheless be excluded if its use in the proceedings would, as a result of what was said or done by any person in authority in eliciting the statement, bring the administration of justice into disrepute."</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 23, at pp. 25-26,&nbsp; Cartwright C.J. noted that:</span></p>

The Queen</i> [[1968] S.C.R. 902], the answer to the question whether such a confession should be admitted depends on whether or not it was voluntary not on whether or not it was true.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

H. Graham "Employing Inconsistent Statements for Impeachment and as Substantive Evidence:&nbsp; A Critical Review and Proposed Amendments of Federal Rules of Evidence 801(d)(1)(A), 613, and 607" (1977), 75 <i>Mich.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">... [it] would virtually destroy the utility of provision (A), which deals with prior inconsistent statements.&nbsp; If the witness has made a prior statement under oath, the threat of a perjury charge makes it highly unlikely that he will subsequently relate a different story again under oath.&nbsp; Hence the instances in which the rule would operate under the suggested redraft would be greatly curtailed.&nbsp; The problem area consists of cases in which the prior statement was not under oath, whether in the course of a judicial proceeding or not, and a rule which does not deal with these cases is of no practical significance.</span></p>

Boisjoly</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 42, could result in a conviction for perjury arising from a sworn declaration made in the course of a criminal investigation.&nbsp; In <i>Boisjoly</i>, police charged an individual with making a false statement under oath contrary to what was then <i>Criminal Code</i>, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 114.&nbsp; The police believed that Boisjoly had lied to them in a sworn statement which dealt with his involvement in the coercion of a witness at a preliminary inquiry.&nbsp; Fauteux C.J., for an unanimous Court, held that even if the affidavit were deceitful, the accused was not liable for making a false statement.&nbsp; In his opinion, s. 114 only applied to a person "permitted" by law to make sworn declarations.&nbsp; He found that "permitted" could not mean simply "not prohibited" since the legislative history demonstrated that the purpose of the section was to limit the circumstances in which oaths would be administered.&nbsp; Indeed, the equivalent section found in an earlier Canadian statute, S.C. 1874, c. 37, was headed <i>Unnecessary Oaths Suppression</i>.&nbsp; Fauteux C.J. was unable to find in any relevant legislation a provision empowering witnesses to make sworn statements to police.&nbsp; He concluded (at p.&nbsp;51):</span></p>

Thus deprived of the ability to observe the demeanour of the witness, the trier will be unable to reach any conclusion as to the truth of the prior statement.</span></p>

Green</i>, 399 U.S. 149 (1970), the United States Supreme Court considered a California law authorizing the substantive use of all prior inconsistent statements.&nbsp; It was argued that this legislation violated the right of the accused to confront all the witnesses called against him guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.&nbsp; The majority of the court concluded that the legislation did not infringe the constitutional right.&nbsp; On this issue the majority stated (at pp.&nbsp;160 and 188):</span></p>
