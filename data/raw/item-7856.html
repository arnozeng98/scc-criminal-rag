The appellants, however, have failed to establish the fourth criterion.&nbsp; The alleged offences are of sufficient seriousness to justify the decision of the police to investigate the criminal allegations.&nbsp; The physical evidence is essential to the police investigation and likely essential as well to any future prosecution.&nbsp; While it is appropriate under this criterion to assess the likely probative value of the evidence sought, the reviewing judge ought not to have pre‑empted the forensic investigation by seemingly prejudging the outcome without first considering all the relevant factors in her assessment.&nbsp; DNA analysis is capable of producing results even under exceptionally unpromising circumstances.&nbsp; The police should not be prevented from pursuing well‑established modes of forensic analysis of relevant physical evidence on the basis that in the end such analysis may prove to be unsuccessful.</span></p>

The criteria are met, including the fourth criterion, which requires the claimant to demonstrate that the injury that would inure to the relationship by the disclosure of the communications is greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of the litigation.&nbsp; The harm caused by the disclosure of the identity of the confidential source in this case is far weightier on the scales than any benefit to the investigation of the crime. </span></p>

The chilling effect that could result from the compelled exposure of confidential journalistic sources also cannot be ignored.&nbsp; In the case before us, X’s confidentiality was crucial to M’s ability to write on a subject of public interest.&nbsp; M had prior positive experiences with X where he had been able to confirm the authenticity of information provided by X via an intermediary.&nbsp; He also took steps to assure himself of X’s credibility and integrity in connection with the latest document by asking for a confidential affidavit and telling X that his/her confidentiality would only be protected if M were satisfied that he was not being misled.&nbsp; Where a journalist has taken credible and reasonable steps to determine the authenticity and reliability of a source, one should respect his or her professional judgment and pause before trespassing on the confidentiality which is the source of the relationship.&nbsp; In this case, demonstrable and profound injury to the journalist/source relationship will result from disclosure of the documents and potentially of the identity of the source.&nbsp; </span></p>

200%"><span lang="EN-GB">On the other side of the balancing exercise, the benefits of disclosure range from speculative to negligible.&nbsp; While it is undisputed that the investigation of crime is an important public objective, the evidence sought by the state is of only questionable assistance in this case.&nbsp; The police hoped to find DNA and fingerprint evidence on the envelope and the document which they thought might reveal the identity of the source of the alleged forgery.&nbsp; However, there is a fatal disconnect between the envelope, the document, the identity of X and the alleged forgery.&nbsp; X received the document anonymously and discarded the original envelope in which he/she received the document.&nbsp; Since X does not know the identity of the sender, learning X’s identity will yield virtually no evidence that could assist in determining who was responsible for the alleged forgery.&nbsp; Moreover, the more documents are manipulated, the less likely the chances of obtaining fingerprints.&nbsp; Both the document and the envelope had been extensively handled.&nbsp; X is therefore in no position to provide any information of assistance to the investigation and is, in any event, under no legal obligation to speak to the police.&nbsp; The benefit to the forgery investigation of getting the documents is, therefore, at best marginal.&nbsp; The only remaining purpose for learning the confidential source’s identity is to discover who created this public controversy.&nbsp; This by itself is not an acceptable basis for interfering with freedom of the press.&nbsp; Lastly, the remote possibility of resolving the debt forgery — a crime of moderate seriousness — is far from sufficiently significant to outweigh the public benefit in protecting a rigorously thorough and responsible press. </span></p>

Moreover, as Laskin and Simmons JJ.A. noted, “[t]he document and the envelope are not merely pieces of evidence tending to show that a crime has been committed.&nbsp; They are the very <i>actus reus</i> [or <i>corpus delicti</i>] of the alleged crime” (para. 115).&nbsp; In such circumstances the identity of the individual who shipped Mr. McIntosh the forged document has no continuing claim to the protection of the law.</p>

First, searches may be physically disruptive and impede efficient and timely publication. Second, retention of seized material by the police may delay or forestall completing the dissemination of the news. Third, confidential sources of information may be fearful of speaking to the press, and the press may lose opportunities to cover various events because of fears on the part of participants that press files will be readily available to the authorities. Fourth, reporters may be deterred from recording and preserving their recollections for future use. Fifth, the processing of news and its dissemination may be chilled by the prospect that searches will disclose internal editorial deliberations. Finally, the press may resort to self-censorship to conceal the fact that it possesses information that may be of interest to the police in an effort to protect its sources and its ability to gather news in the future. All this may adversely impact on the role of the media in furthering the search for truth, community participation and self-fulfillment. [p. 452]</p>

While valid questions may remain as to what constitutes a media organization for the purpose of giving notice, there can be no dispute in the present appeal that a large news media business like the<i> National Post</i> belongs to this class.</p>

The process of applying for a search warrant should be sensitive to the need to prevent undue or overly intrusive interference in their operations, regardless of whether the activity in question is investigation, reporting or commentary.&nbsp; The presumption of a notice requirement would allow media organizations to raise their concerns at the first opportunity, thereby precluding or minimizing unnecessary intrusions into their activities.</p>

If the applicant feels that notice should not be given because the situation is urgent or because the information or documents being sought might be lost, the application should state this and explain why the notice requirement should be waived. It would then fall to the authorizing judge to determine whether the requirement should in fact be waived and to craft conditions that would, so far as possible, limit interference with the operations of the affected media organization.</p>
