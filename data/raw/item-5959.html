   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant was charged with unlawfully driving a motor vehicle, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s.&nbsp;236 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>Although there was no evidence adduced that the arresting constable had any reasonable or probable grounds for believing that an offence under s.&nbsp;234 of the <i>Code </i>had been committed, the appellant submitted to a breathalyzer test and a certificate of analysis was admitted in evidence. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta dismissed an appeal by way of stated case from the conviction of the accused and an appeal with leave was then brought to this Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. <i>dissenting</i>): The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Martland, Judson, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: As held by the Appellate Division, the absence of reasonable and probable grounds for belief of impairment may afford a defence to a charge of refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test laid under s.&nbsp;235(2) of the <i>Code, </i>but it does not render inadmissible certificate evidence in the case of a charge under s.&nbsp;236.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., <i>dissenting</i>:<i> </i>The requirement in both s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>)<i> </i>and s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) that the breath test should have been made pursuant to the demand under s.&nbsp;235(1) was inserted by Parliament with the intention of limiting those cases where the analysis could be proved by a certificate of a</span></p>

   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">qualified technician and then that such analysis would provide <i>prima facie </i>proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused only to those cases where the peace officer had, on reasonable and probable grounds, believed that the accused was or had been driving while impaired. This was only a proper requirement when the test was one which the citizen was required to submit to on penalty of committing an offence if he refused.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Accordingly, there having been no evidence adduced that the arresting officer had reasonable grounds for believing the appellant to have been driving while impaired, the Crown could not prove its case by the production of the certificate of the “qualified technician” since it was not the result of a test taken “pursuant to a demand under subsection&nbsp;235(1)” as required by s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>).</span></p>

   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 185]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">ary 9, 1973. By that judgment, the Appellate Division dismissed an appeal by way of stated case from the conviction of the appellant by a Provincial Judge on a charge under s.&nbsp;236 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The stated case follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">CASE STATED by Dean Saks, Provincial Judge, sitting at the City of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Edmonton</span><span lang="EN-CA">, in the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Province</span><span lang="EN-CA"> of Alberta, under the provisions of Section 762 of the Criminal Code of Canada.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. The Appellant, Ronald Joseph Rilling, was charged that on or about the 21st day of January, A.D. 1972 at the City of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, he did unlawfully drive a motor vehicle, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to Section 236 of the Criminal Code of Canada.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">2. The hearing of the said charge was commenced before me on the 29th day of May, A.D. 1972 in the presence of the accused. The accused was represented by Counsel at the hearing.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">3. Evidence for the Crown was given by the arresting officer, Constable William Hargarten of the Edmonton City Police, who stated inter alia that the accused blew into the breathalyzer machine and that he did not recall who was the operator of the machine.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">4. The Crown applied to introduce as exhibits three Certificates, one of which was the Certificate of Analysis showing the alcohol content in the blood as provided by the provisions of the Criminal Code.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">5. The appellants counsel admitted service of the Certificates upon the accused, but objected to the Certificate of Analysis pertaining to the alcohol content in the blood being admitted as evidence on the grounds that there was no evidence before the Court that the arresting Constable had any reasonable or probable grounds for believing that an offence under Section 234 of the Criminal Code as required by Section 235(1) of the Criminal Code, had been committed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">6. In my opinion there was no evidence adduced before the Court to show that the arresting Constable had any reasonable or probable grounds for believing that an offence under Section 234 of the Criminal Code had been committed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">7. Following the decision of Mr.&nbsp;Justice Neil Primrose of the Supreme Court of Alberta in the case of Regina vs. Joseph William McHarg, (unreported, a copy of</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 186]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">which is attached) I allowed the said Certificate to be admitted as evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">8. One of the arguments set forth by counsel in his summation was that there was no evidence identifying the accused as being the person referred to in the said Certificate. This question was not brought up during the trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">9. The said Certificate of Analysis showed that the result of the chemical analysis was 160 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and as a result, I found the accused guilty as charged.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant Ronald Joseph Rilling desires to question the validity of the conviction on the grounds that it was erroneous in law.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The questions submitted for the judgment of this Honourable Court are as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(a) Did I err in permitting the Certificate of Analysis pertaining to the alcohol content of the blood to be entered when there was, in my opinion, no evidence before the court that the arresting Constable had any reasonable or probable grounds for believing that an offence under Section 234 of the Criminal Code had been committed?</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(b) Did I err in ruling that there was evidence identifying the accused as being the person referred to in the said Certificate?</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The issue as to identification was dropped in the Appellate Division so that Court was and this Court is concerned solely with the question in para.&nbsp;(a) <i>supra.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is necessary to consider the provisions of ss. 234 to 237 inclusive of the <i>Criminal Code </i>which are as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">234.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>for a first offence, to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to imprisonment for three months or to both;</span></p>

   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 187]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>c</i>)<i> </i>for each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than three months.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">235.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) Where a peace officer on reasonable and probable grounds believes that a person is committing, or at any time within the preceding two hours has committed, an offence under section&nbsp;234, he may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as practicable, require him to provide then or as soon thereafter as is practicable a sample of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made in order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, and to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample to be taken.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) Every one who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under subsection&nbsp;(1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">236.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> Every one who drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It must be realized that to answer the question put in the stated case we are concerned solely with the admissibility of the certificate of the technician produced at the trial of the appellant as Ex. 3. No <i>viva voce </i>evidence was adduced at trial as to the analysis and in fact the only witness who testified at the trial was the arresting constable. Counsel for the Crown had given notice to the appellant of the intention to produce the certificate in accordance with the provisions of s.&nbsp;237(5) of the <i>Code.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The admissibility of this certificate is governed solely by the provisions of s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) of the <i>Code </i>which I now repeat:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It will be seen that if the certificate is admissible then it alone is evidence of the statements contained therein and was sufficient to prove the Crown’s case. Apart from the provisions of this paragraph of the subsection, the certificate of course would not have been admissible and the Crown would have had to adduce the <i>viva voce </i>evidence of the technician. There is no issue here whether such <i>viva voce </i>evidence would have been admissible and its effect is provided in s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>). That issue is not before the Court and cases which deal with the admissibility of <i>viva voce </i>evidence as to the analysis are irrelevant. The simple problem here is whether the Crown in the exact circumstances of this case may prove the guilt of the appellant by the mere production and filing of the technician’s certificate.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Prior to the amendments wrought by 1968-69 (Can.), c.&nbsp;38, the <i>Code </i>dealt with the offences of driving when intoxicated or under the influence of drugs and impaired driving. Section 224 then provided for the admission of evidence of chemical analysis of blood and the form of proof in subsections&nbsp;(3) to (7) inclusive, as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(3) In any proceedings under section&nbsp;222 or 223, the result of a chemical analysis of a sample of the blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance of a person may be admitted in evidence on the issue whether that person was intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic drug or whether his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol or a drug, notwithstanding that he was not, before he gave the sample, warned that he need not give the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 192]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">sample or that the results of the analysis of the sample might be used in evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(4) No person is required to give a sample of blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance for chemical analysis for the purposes of this section&nbsp;and evidence that a person refused to give such a sample or that such a sample was not taken is not admissible nor shall such a refusal or the fact that a sample was not taken be the subject of comment by any person in the proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(5) In any proceedings under section&nbsp;222 or 223, a certificate purporting to be signed by an analyst stating that he has performed a chemical analysis on the blood, urine, breath or other bodily substances of a person and stating the results of his analysis or examination is <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the facts stated in the certificate without proof of the signature or the official character of the person by whom it purports to be signed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(6) In this section&nbsp;“analyst” means a person designated by the Attorney General as an analyst for the purposes of this section.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(7) Subsection&nbsp;(5) does not apply in any proceedings unless at least seven days’ notice in writing is given to the accused that it is intended to tender the certificate of the analyst in evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I note that by subs. (3) the evidence of chemical analysis by an analyst was permitted and by subs. (5) the proof of that evidence by a certificate was permitted and such certificate was to provide <i>prima facie </i>evidence. But s.&nbsp;224(4) clearly provided that no person was required to give a sample of his, <i>inter alia, </i>breath so that any sample taken and analyzed and then made subject to a certificate was provided voluntarily by the person.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Parliament made most important amendments by s.&nbsp;16 of 1968-69 (Can.), c.&nbsp;38. By that section, ss. 222 to 224 of the <i>Code </i>were repealed and replaced by ss. 222, 223, 224 and 224A. Those replacing sections&nbsp;now appear in the <i>Criminal Code, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c.&nbsp;C-34, as ss. 234 to 237 which I have set out in these reasons. Hereafter, I shall refer to the sections&nbsp;as now numbered. One of the most drastic amendments is that appearing in the present s.&nbsp;235. As I have said, under the <i>Code </i>as it had provided before, no one could be required</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 193]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">to provide a sample of his blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance. Under the present s.&nbsp;235(1), where a peace officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that a person is driving while impaired or has done so within the preceding two hours, he may demand that such person provide a sample of his breath. By s.&nbsp;235(2), a person who refuses to comply with such a demand commits an offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">When Parliament thus diametrically reversed the provisions of the <i>Code </i>as to the provision of breath samples, it provided in the series of sections&nbsp;quoted a number of protective provisions for the citizen. So s.235(2) permits the defence of reasonable excuse for refusal to provide the sample of breath. By s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>)(i), the person taking the sample was required to offer to the person from who it was taken a specimen of his breath in an approved container and by the provisions of s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>)(iii)(A) to so certify in the certificate. The provision as to evidence of the analysis of the breath sample given in compliance with the demand and the proof of the analysis by certificate both commence with the words, “Where a sample of the breath of the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection&nbsp;235(1)”. These are specific provisions only applicable to cases where the police officer has made such a demand. Parliament, in express words, made proof by the filing of a certificate in such case possible only when the test was made <i>pursuant to a demand </i>under subsection&nbsp;235(1). (The italics are my own.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Because of technical difficulties preventing the production of an “approved container” referred to in s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>)(i), the Governor in Council, using the provisions of s.&nbsp;120 of 1968-69 (Can.), c.&nbsp;38, declared in effect the whole of what are now ss. 234 to 237 inclusive, except the said s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>)(i), 237(1)(<i>f</i>)(iii)(A) and the definition</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 194]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">of “approved container” in s.&nbsp;237(6). This piecemeal proclamation of the statute was approved by a five to four majority of this Court in a judgment upon a reference, <i>Re Proclamation of Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a><i>. </i>As a result, the protections inserted in the procedure by Parliament have been effectively removed. The provisions, however, of s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>), and s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) except the reference to “approved container” have been declared in effect.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The result of the judgment of the Appellate Division from which this appeal is taken as well as some of the decisions in other Provinces cited therein is to effectively remove another protection of the accused. I am of the opinion that the requirement in both s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>) and s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) that the test should have been made pursuant to the demand under s.&nbsp;235(1) was inserted by Parliament with the intention of limiting those cases where the analysis could be proved by a certificate of a qualified technician and then that such analysis would provide <i>prima facie </i>proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused only to those cases where the peace officer had, on reasonable and probable grounds, believed that the accused was or had been driving while impaired. This was only a proper requirement when the test was one which the citizen was required to submit to on penalty of committing an offence if he refused. It is also noted that the person who makes the analysis was changed from an “analyst” in the old s.&nbsp;224 to a “qualified technician” in the present s.&nbsp;237.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">An “analyst” was not defined in the previous provisions of the <i>Code. </i>Now, the “analyst” makes the analysis of the chemical used in the breathalizer and then a “qualified technician” makes the analysis of the specimen of breath expelled into the breathalizer. Section 237(6) defines an “analyst” merely as a person so designated by the Attorney General and a “qualified technician” as being a</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 195]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">person designated by the Attorney General “as being qualified to operate an approved instrument”, quite plainly someone, probably a police officer, merely trained to operate a device with no skill in chemistry. Therefore, the lower degree of technical qualification required for the tester and issuer of the certificate would be another reason for Parliament only to authorize the use of such evidence, and its proof of mere filing of a certificate, to those cases which had commenced with a peace officer believing, on reasonable and probable grounds, that the accused was or had been driving while impaired.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Allen J.A., in his reasons for judgment for the Appellate Division, stated that he did not think it fair to assume that members of the public who were not showing visible signs of impairment would be harassed. That issue is, in my opinion, irrelevant. The appellant here was charged with an offence solely statutory in its creation, that is, driving an automobile with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of his blood, contrary to s.&nbsp;236 of the <i>Code. </i>The Crown seeks to prove that offence by first requiring him to submit to a breath test and then prove his guilt by the mere production and filing of a certificate of the result of that test made by a “qualified technician”. Yet all the Courts below are agreed, and the stated case so stipulates, that there was no evidence whatever adduced to show that the arresting officer had any reasonable grounds for believing that the accused was driving while impaired. It is difficult to understand how such a test could have been taken and such a certificate issued “pursuant to a demand under subsection&nbsp;235(1)”. It is, in fact, exactly contrary to a demand made pursuant to that section.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In my consideration of the appeal, I have found most informative the very careful analysis of the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 196]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">whole question of the use of the breathalizer by the learned authors of <i>Breathalizer Law in Canada, </i>McLeod and Takach.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the result, there having been no evidence adduced that the arresting officer had reasonable grounds for believing the appellant to have been driving while impaired, I would rule that the Crown could not prove its case by the production of the certificate of the “qualified technician” since it was not the result of a test taken “pursuant to a demand under subsection&nbsp;235(1)” as required by s. 237(1)(<i>f</i>).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I would allow the appeal and direct the acquittal of the appellant.</span></p>
