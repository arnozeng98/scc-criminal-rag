(dissenting):&nbsp; The trial judge’s omission of limiting instructions about N’s opinion evidence, based in part on a body of information not otherwise before the jury, was a serious error that may well have directly affected the jury’s assessment of the credibility not only of the accused V but of K.&nbsp; Credibility and existence of reasonable doubt on all the evidence were the key issues before the jury.&nbsp; Without the required limiting instructions on investigative hearsay and police opinion testimony, there were two related dangers that would go unaddressed:&nbsp; first, that the jury would improperly use the “investigative hearsay” evidence as evidence of its truth and, second, that the jury would wrongly attach weight to N’s personal opinion that V was guilty.&nbsp; In combination, these two problematic aspects were of more concern than either might have been on its own.&nbsp; Each reinforced the other.&nbsp; N’s opinion likely strengthened K’s credibility, as did the implication that N relied in forming that opinion on material not before the jury but which corroborated K’s evidence.&nbsp; [66] [74-75] [101]</span></p>

It was at best unclear and at worst a likely inference that N’s opinion was based solely on evidence other than that which had been admitted before the jury.&nbsp; Finally, there was a danger that the jury would put more credence in the improperly offered opinion simply because it came from an experienced and respected police officer, thus bolstering K’s credibility while undermining that of V.&nbsp; The Crown’s assertion that the jury likely assumed that the investigating officer thought V was guilty underlines the need for the limiting instructions rather than providing an excuse for their omission.&nbsp; [80-84] [86]</span></p>

Morton compiled a number of photographs of possible suspects and brought them to the hospital on the day of the fruitful interview with Mr. Kong on January 2, 2001.&nbsp; The photographs were never shown to Mr. Kong, however, as the officers’ working theory was abandoned when the victim promptly identified his attacker as “Man Tak”, that person being the respondent Mr. Van.&nbsp; At that time, Det. Morton also discovered that the wound on Mr. Kong’s hand was simply a result of Mr. Kong’s attempt to defend himself during the stabbing, which further eroded the basis for the loan-shark theory.&nbsp; Detective Sergeant Nealon also provided detailed testimony of the officers’ subsequent attempts to locate Mr. Van and to obtain corroborating evidence of Mr. Kong’s story.&nbsp;</p>

In this case, it is not disputed that the failure to give a limiting instruction is an error of law that falls within s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) and that the appeal could therefore have been allowed.&nbsp; However, it still falls to this Court to determine whether the convictions can be upheld despite the existence of an error, with resort to s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Code</i>. Under this provision, a conviction can be upheld providing that the error has not resulted in a substantial wrong or a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; The Crown bears the burden of showing the appellate court that the provision is applicable, and satisfying the court that the conviction should stand notwithstanding the error.&nbsp; To do so, it must establish that the error of law falls into one of two categories.&nbsp; First, that it is an error so harmless or minor that it could not have had any impact on the verdict.&nbsp; In the second category are serious errors that would otherwise justify a new trial or an acquittal, but for the fact that the evidence against the accused was so overwhelming that any other verdict would have been impossible to obtain: <i>&nbsp;Khan</i>; <i>R. v.

Chibok v. The Queen </i>(1956), 24 C.R. 354 (S.C.C.), at p. 359).&nbsp; This is consistent with Lamer C.J.’s pronouncement in <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, that, in respect of errors in a trial judge’s charge to the jury, “accused individuals are entitled to <u>properly</u> instructed juries. There is, however, no requirement for <u>perfectly</u> instructed juries” (para. 2 (emphasis in original)).&nbsp; Thus, a slight deviation from the standard of a perfect jury charge is likely to constitute a harmless error that could justify upholding a conviction.&nbsp; Errors might also be characterized as having a minor effect if they relate to an issue that was not central to the overall determination of guilt or innocence, or if they benefit the defence, such as by imposing a more onerous burden on the Crown (<i>Khan</i>, at para. 30).&nbsp; The question of whether an error or its effect is minor should be answered without reference to the strength of the other evidence presented at trial.&nbsp; The overriding question is whether the error on its face or in its effect was so minor, so irrelevant to the ultimate issue in the trial, or so clearly non-prejudicial, that any reasonable judge or jury could not possibly have rendered a different verdict if the error had not been made.</p>

line-height:200%">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An appellate court can also uphold a conviction under s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) in the event of an error that was <i>not </i>minor and that <i>cannot </i>be said to have caused no prejudice to the accused, if the case against the accused was so overwhelming that a reasonable and properly instructed jury would inevitably have convicted (<i>Khan</i>, at para. 31).&nbsp; The ability to uphold a conviction in the face of a serious error at trial was aptly expressed by Sopinka J. in <i>R. v. S. (P.L.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, who wrote that “depriving the accused of a proper trial is justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable result would be another conviction” (p. 916, affirmed in <i>Khan</i>, at para.&nbsp;31).&nbsp; The high standard of an invariable or inevitable conviction is understandable, given the difficult task for an appellate court of evaluating the strength of the Crown’s case retroactively, without the benefit of hearing the witnesses’ testimony and experiencing the trial as it unfolded (<i>Trochym</i>, at para. 82).&nbsp; It is thus necessary to afford any possible measure of doubt concerning the strength of the Crown’s case to the benefit of the accused person.&nbsp; The rationale for upholding a conviction in these circumstances is persuasive; in the words of Binnie J. in <i>R. v. Jolivet</i>, 2000 SCC 29, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, at para. 46:&nbsp;</p>

Sgt.&nbsp;Nealon’s references to statements made by Mr. Kong, for example, were matched by Mr.&nbsp;Kong’s direct testimony at trial.&nbsp; The hearsay evidence that was <i>not </i>before the jury through other sources was peripheral to the main issue at trial, and the jury’s use of this evidence for the truth of its contents would not have affected the verdict.&nbsp; For instance, the respondent seeks to impugn Det.&nbsp;Sgt.&nbsp;Nealon’s statements regarding the notes he received from the officers who had initiated the investigation, his communications with Mr. Kong’s sisters, and his interviews with employees of Casino Niagara and an Ontario Provincial Police officer stationed at that casino.&nbsp; However, none of this evidence was controversial or contested by the defence at trial, and none pointed to the guilt or innocence of the accused.&nbsp; It simply formed part of the narrative of the investigation, and the jury’s knowledge of these events could not have caused any prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; The lack of centrality of the otherwise inadmissible hearsay evidence introduced through Det.

Again, the jury were properly instructed on numerous occasions to rely only on evidence presented at trial and not to engage in speculation.&nbsp; For instance, the trial judge stated in his charge to the jury:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">Thus, I concur with Winkler C.J.O., dissenting at the Court of Appeal, that it is highly unlikely that the jury would have understood Det.

Nealon in which counsel asked if there was anything else concerning the investigation that might “assist the jury in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused”, I believe that her choice of words was, while misguided, of little consequence and would not have caused any real prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; The jury would have been aware that she was merely seeking to conclude the examination-in-chief and to ensure that there was nothing the witness had neglected to mention. The suggestion that the jury would use this statement to infer that everything Det. Sgt. Nealon had recounted previously could go to the ultimate issue of guilt is unfounded.&nbsp; Even taken together with the other troubling aspects of Det.&nbsp;Sgt.&nbsp;Nealon’s testimony, the lack of a limiting instruction on this issue would not have made any significant difference to the jury’s perception of Det. Sgt. Nealon’s testimony.</p>

Sgt. Nealon, whose answers are now the subject of appeal, and that counsel registered no complaint following the trial judge’s charge to the jury in which a limiting instruction was notably absent.&nbsp; A failure to object to an error may suggest that the error was not serious or that it did not result in an unfair trial (<i>Jacquard</i>, at para. 38; <i>R. v. Daley</i>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 58).&nbsp; That said, an error might still be considered serious despite the absence of an objection at trial (<i>R. v. Arcangioli</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, at p. 143; <i>R. v. Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at pp.&nbsp;1319-20).&nbsp; In this case, the appellant suggests that defence counsel’s failure to object may have been tactical, as the defence would not have wanted to further confine the use to which the officers’ testimony, so central to the defence, could be made.&nbsp; However, the majority of the Court of Appeal questioned the logic of this submission, since the trial judge <i>had </i>cautioned the jury about the shortcomings of the defence’s loan-shark theory.&nbsp; Accordingly, a limiting instruction with respect to the officers’ testimony could not have done any further harm to the defence theory.&nbsp; I am inclined to this view myself, and believe that counsel’s lack of objection to the errors at trial arose not from a calculated decision, but from the fact that the error was, in the context of the case, not significant.&nbsp;</p>

The medical evidence, however, clearly showed that these injuries had occurred.&nbsp; With respect, I must confess that I find this argument bordering on absurd.&nbsp; Regardless of whether Mr. Kong was fully aware of the extent of his injuries, the injuries themselves are not contested.&nbsp; Moreover, one would not expect the victim of an attack so severe as this to be cognizant of each and every injury he sustained.</p>

As set out by Sharpe J.A., writing for the majority of the Court of Appeal (2008 ONCA 383, 92 O.R. (3d) 462, at paras. 21‑28),&nbsp; Det. Sgt. Nealon, then a 19‑year veteran of the Toronto Police Service, led the investigation together with Det. Craig Morton.&nbsp; Detective Sergeant Nealon’s position before the jury was prominent. As the lead investigator assisting the Crown, he was exempted from the order excluding witnesses and, for most of the trial, he sat with the Crown at the counsel table. Detective Sergeant Nealon testified after all but one of the other police officers had given their evidence and immediately before Mr. Kong testified. Detective Sergeant Nealon’s evidence added little to the testimony of the other police officers or to the direct evidence of Kong that would follow. The purpose of his evidence appears to have been to explain the steps the police had taken to investigate the attack, and to satisfy the jury that the crime had been properly and thoroughly investigated.</p>

He explained that, as there initially had been some thought that the attack might have been gang‑related, a police guard had been placed at Kong’s bedside “in the off‑chance that whoever it was that committed this crime had wanted to finish the job off”.&nbsp; Detective Sergeant Nealon testified that he spoke to an Ontario Provincial Police (“OPP”) officer at the casino who shared “intelligence information” which “more or less corroborated what the victim was telling [him]”.</p>

At various points in his evidence, Det. Sgt. Nealon offered his personal opinion as to the respondent’s guilt: “It was my intention [<i>sic</i>] at that point [following an interview with Mr. Kong] that the man responsible for this attack on [Mr. Kong] was a person known as Duc Van, driving a 1987 Dodge Caravan, red in colour, with that licence plate.”</p>

He agreed that he had received information regarding a story in a Chinese‑language newspaper that had caused Mr. Kong fear because it identified him as a victim and published his name and address. Detective Sergeant Nealon also agreed that once Mr. Kong identified the respondent as his assailant, all other investigation stopped and the police focussed on finding the respondent and evidence to corroborate his guilt.</p>

Repeated references to information that “unfolded” and to “information that I received” could well have been taken by the jury to suggest that this senior and respected police officer had evidence inculpating the appellant that had not been presented at trial.

The Crown concedes that one aspect of proper instructions in these circumstances should have brought it home to the jury that the Detectice Sargeant’s opinion that he arrested the guilty party was not evidence of anything and must be disregarded.&nbsp; This instruction would not have undercut the defence in any respect or been less favourable to the defence than was its omission.</p>

D.D.</i>, 2000 SCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
29.15pt;line-height:200%">A basic tenet of our law is that the usual witness may not give opinion evidence, but testify only to facts within his knowledge, observation and experience.&nbsp; This is a commendable principle since it is the task of the fact finder, whether a jury or judge alone, to decide what secondary inferences are to be drawn from the facts proved.

In this case, it was at best unclear and at worst a likely inference that the officer’s opinion was based on evidence other than that which had been admitted before the jury.&nbsp; Finally, there was a danger that, given the long experience and excellent career history of Det. Sgt. Nealon, the jury would attach undue weight to his opinion: see, for example, <i>Graat v. The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1982] 2 S.C.R. 819, at pp. 839-40.&nbsp;</p>

There was a real risk that&nbsp; jurors would put more credence in the improperly offered opinion simply because it came from an experienced and respected police officer.&nbsp; In other words, there is a legitimate concern that the “jury might forego independent analysis of the facts and bow too readily to the opinion of an expert or other influential witness”: <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> (6th ed. 2006), vol. 1, at § 12. While of course this opinion was not presented as expert opinion evidence, the dangers noted by Major J. in <i>D.D.</i> at para. 53 in that context were also present here:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

line-height:200%">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective Sergeant Nealon referred in his evidence to several sources of information that were not otherwise before the jury.&nbsp; He testified, for example, that he reviewed the notebooks of the officers involved up to the point that he took over the investigation.&nbsp; Some of these officers were named, others were not and none of them testified at trial.&nbsp; He testified about his interviews with Mr. Kong’s three sisters, none of whom testified.&nbsp; His evidence was that he did this to “get some information about [Mr. Kong] and his background, and any information . . . with respect to [the] offence.”&nbsp; He referred to his conversation with an OPP intelligence officer at the casino whose information “more or less corroborated what the victim was telling [him]”.&nbsp; He referred to interviews with eight unnamed casino employees and to a videotaped statement he took from Mr. Kong.&nbsp; None of this material was otherwise before the jury. His testimony also included references to a “lot of information”, and his opinion that the respondent was the guilty party was based on all of his investigation.&nbsp; His evidence gave the impression that all of the information he received from all of these sources corroborated Mr. Kong’s version of the events.&nbsp; The re-examination evidence, which I set out earlier, demonstrates the likelihood that the jury would have understood the officer’s opinion to be based on everything he had done, including many things that were not in the evidence. His evidence was, in effect, that the officer’s opinion that the respondent was guilty was based, as he put it, on “[his] investigation . . . and information that [he] received”.</p>

line-height:200%">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I respectfully agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the officer’s testimony created the impression that his personal opinion about the respondent’s guilt was based in part on a body of information not disclosed to the jury. I would add that some of this information (such as from the OPP intelligence officer) was expressly represented to the jury as corroborating Mr. Kong’s version of events while it was implicit in the officer’s testimony that other information also had this effect, as for example, the interviews with the three sisters and the eight casino employees.</p>

line-height:200%">[92]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the jury would have had the impression that Det. Sgt. Nealon’s opinion about the respondent’s guilt and about the credibility of Mr. Kong was based not only on his long experience as a police officer, but also on a body of information not disclosed to them.&nbsp; This impression compounded the seriousness of the omission of proper instructions that his opinion should be given no weight.</p>

line-height:200%">[93]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the Crown submits that the impact of the failure to give the proper limiting instructions was mitigated in this case by other instructions given by the judge.&nbsp; These instructions consist of a single, brief mid-trial instruction given during Det. Sgt. Nealon’s testimony in relation to his use of Det. Morton’s notes and several instructions that the jury must decide the case on the evidence it saw and heard in the courtroom.&nbsp;</p>

I do not accept this view.</p>

line-height:200%">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The failure to object is, of course, a relevant consideration in assessing the importance of a legal error as seen in the concrete reality of the trial.&nbsp; Thus, as this Court has held, defence counsel’s failure to comment at the trial is worthy of consideration: <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 38; see also <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129,<i> </i>and<i> R. v. Chambers</i>,<i> </i>[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293.&nbsp; The failure to object may inform a court’s conclusion on both the overall accuracy of an instruction and the seriousness and likely impact of the error.&nbsp; It is, however, only one consideration.</p>

line-height:200%">[97]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The omission of the limiting instructions was a mistake, and there is no plausible argument, in my view, that the substance of the required instructions was addressed in other aspects of the charge.&nbsp; The failure to object, therefore, is of no assistance in determining the overall accuracy of the judge’s directions.&nbsp; All other considerations, in my respectful view, support the Crown’s concession that this error was serious and, in my view, there are strong reasons to think that the omission had a direct impact on the critical issue of the credibility of the respondent and Mr. Kong.&nbsp; So it becomes a question of whether the failure to object, on its own, should persuade us that there is no reasonable possibility that the error had any impact.&nbsp;</p>
