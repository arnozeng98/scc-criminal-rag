D. Wilson, N. J. Garson and C. E. Hinkson’s <i>Civil Jury Instructions</i> (2nd ed.

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">4.&nbsp; What does “proof on a balance of probabilities” mean?&nbsp; It does not mean proof beyond a reasonable doubt — that standard of proof applies only in criminal trials.&nbsp; In civil trials, such as this one, the party who has the burden of proof on an issue must convince you that what he or she asserts is more probable than not — that the balance is tipped in his or her favour.&nbsp; You must examine the evidence and determine whether the party who has the burden of proof on an issue is relying on evidence that is more convincing than the evidence relied on by the other side.&nbsp; In short, you must decide whether the existence of the contested fact is more probable than not.</p>

When examining a trial judge’s instructions to a jury, the reviewing court must focus on “the general sense which the words used have likely conveyed to the jury . . .&nbsp;. The standard that a trial judge’s instructions are to be held to is not perfection.&nbsp; The accused is entitled to a properly instructed jury, not a perfectly instructed jury . . . . It is the overall effect of the charge that matters”: <i>R. v. Daley</i>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 31. The reviewing court must not be distracted from the key question on appeal.&nbsp; That question is not whether the judge’s directions could have been better. In this case, the question is whether the charge and recharge, taken as a whole, give rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not understand the legal requirement that the Crown must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt: <i>R. v.

Brydon </i>(1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 1 (B.C.C.A.), rev’d [1995] 4 S.C.R. 253, and the line of cases in this Court following <i>Lifchus</i> give the flavour of these difficulties. Charges that had been widely used for years were found to contain reversible errors.&nbsp; The case law has developed a long list of “do’s” and “don’ts”, each of which may constitute reversible error.&nbsp; By way of illustration, the judgments of this Court teach that trial judges must not define reasonable doubt as an ordinary concept or equate it to a moral certainty or qualify the word “doubt” with anything other than the word “reasonable” or use specific examples that may cause the jury to ascribe an everyday meaning as opposed to a legal one to the term: see <i>Lifchus</i>; <i>Starr</i>; <i>R. v. Bisson</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 306.&nbsp; The complexity of the area is underscored by the fact that, in this Court, a rehearing was held in <i>Lifchus</i> which resulted in changes in the instruction proposed in the reasons released initially: see footnote at p. 320.&nbsp; The legal landscape in this area resembles a battlefield on which many verdicts have been casualties.&nbsp; The possibility of reversible error in this part of the jury charge is great.&nbsp; </p>

However, a court reviewing a judge’s answer to the jury’s question should take a practical view of the risks and benefits of the trial judge’s doing what it is asserted, after the fact, the trial judge ought to have done. In this case, my view is that the judge’s reluctance to depart on this subject from the well-established language approved by the voluminous case law was entirely justified: not only were the risks of attempting some further explanation significant, but also the potential for its appreciably helping the jury was meagre.</p>

line-height:200%">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The reality of this point is underlined by the suggestions made by counsel at trial as to how the judge should respond to the jury’s question.&nbsp; Both counsel agreed that the judge should not start from scratch.&nbsp; Crown counsel, with apparent approval of the defence, suggested that what was needed was a re-reading of the main charge “with inflection” (A.R., at p. 155).&nbsp; Both counsel thought the difficulty was with the term “balance of probabilities”, but they had little in the way of suggestions as to how to explain it.&nbsp; </p>

line-height:200%">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The point is also made clear by the meagre improvements to the judge’s charge proposed by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; For the Court of Appeal, simply linking “balance of probabilities” to “probable or likely guilt” and saying that “absolute certainty” means to know something beyond the possibility of any doubt would have been adequate (paras. 26-27).&nbsp; My difficulty with this is that, realistically assessed, these additions would have contributed very modestly, if at all, to the jury’s understanding of the critical concept of reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Requiring the trial judge to attempt to achieve these negligible improvements while under the very real and immediate pressure of responding to a jury’s question opens up a very considerable risk of error in exchange for no real benefit.</p>

line-height:200%">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>I do not share the Court of Appeal’s concern that, as a result of the judge’s answer to the jury’s question, they would have been “at least discouraged, if not dissuaded” from asking further questions (para. 24).&nbsp; While I agree with the principle that the judge should not discourage jury questions on points of difficulty, my view is that, on this topic, the judge’s instructions were realistic.&nbsp; </p>

line-height:200%">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>This point is reinforced by the difficulty trial counsel had in making any significant suggestions as to what the answer should contain and by the very modest suggestions made by the Court of Appeal. The judge said that she had to leave the jury with the instruction as she had repeated it because reasonable doubt defies precise interpretation, attempts to explain it further lead to more confusion than clarity and there was very little that she could add.&nbsp; In the context of the full and perfectly accurate instructions which she gave and repeated on reasonable doubt, my view is the judge’s statements to the jury accurately reflected the state of the law.&nbsp; The trial judge’s job in giving legal instructions to the jury is to help them to understand the law accurately, not to push its boundaries.</p>

line-height:200%">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>It is also my view that the Court of Appeal’s analysis overlooks one important aspect of the judge’s answer to the question.&nbsp; The judge did not simply repeat the reasonable doubt instructions she had previously given.&nbsp; Her answer added a section that, in my view, correctly helped to refocus the jury on reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The judge told the jury that her obligation was to provide a direction on reasonable doubt and directed their attention to that concept in the instructions.&nbsp; This, in itself, was a useful response to the jury’s question; it reminded them of what was critical to their deliberations.</p>
