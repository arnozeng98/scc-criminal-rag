   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Respondent was convicted of conspiring to import drugs in contravention of s.&nbsp;5(1) of the <i>Narcotic Control Act, </i>thereby committing a breach of s.&nbsp;423(1) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The indictment was preferred by the Attorney General and signed by his agent. The accused appealed on the ground, <i>inter alia, </i>that the indictment was a nullity because the Attorney General of Canada did not have the right to prefer it. The Court of Appeal for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Quebec</span><span lang="EN-CA"> allowed the appeal upon this ground. This judgment was rendered before the judgment of this Court in <i>R. v. Hauser, </i>[1979] 1 S.C.R. 984, but respondent argued that this decision was not conclusive because it held that the Attorney General of Canada could prefer indictments for breaches of the <i>Narcotic Control Act, </i>while in the case at bar the offence alleged, that of conspiracy, is a breach of the <i>Criminal Code.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">: The appeal should be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 189]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The right of the Attorney General of Canada to initiate proceedings is incidental to the definition of “Attorney General” in s.&nbsp;2 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>In <i>Hauser, </i>a majority of this Court found that the Parliament of Canada had the power to authorize the Attorney General of Canada to prefer indictments for a breach of the <i>Narcotic Control Act, </i>and it held unanimously that the Parliament of Canada could authorize the Attorney General of Canada to conduct proceedings instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of any breach or conspiracy to commit a breach of a statute of the Parliament of Canada, other than the <i>Criminal Code. </i>It is true that in the case at bar the charge against the accused was that of conspiracy under s.&nbsp;423 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>but it is clear that, had it wished to do so, Parliament could have provided for a conspiracy to commit a breach of the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>itself. This course was not necessary in view of the provision contained in s.&nbsp;115(2) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>Additionally, s.&nbsp;27(2) of the <i>Interpretation Act </i>provides essentially that if Parliament can give the Attorney General authority to institute proceedings for the enforcement of a federal statute, it is necessarily incidental that, for the proper enforcement of such an Act, it can also institute proceedings for a conspiracy to commit a breach of that Act. There is no sound reason for now reconsidering the judgment in <i>Hauser </i>and reversing it.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of the Court was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">MARTLAND J.—The issue in this appeal is as to whether or not the Attorney General of Canada has the power to institute a prosecution against the appellant for having conspired with others to import drugs in contravention of subs. 5(1) of the <i>Narcotic Control Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, which provides:</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Except as authorized by this Act or the regulations, no person shall import into </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> or export from </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> any narcotic.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The indictment charged that the appellant:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">[TRANSLATION] Between the 22nd day of March 1975 and the 25th day of April 1976 unlawfully did conspire with Michel Véronneau, Jean-Claude Pomerleau, Paul Pomerleau, Normand Pomerleau, Buddy Wells, Amedh Hassan Chairi, Robert Barbeau, Claude Ménard, and with persons unknown to this day to commit an indictable offence, namely to import narcotics into Canada, namely about 50 pounds of hashish (Cannabis resin) contrary to section&nbsp;5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, chap. N-1, committing thereby an indictable offence contrary to section&nbsp;423(1) of the Criminal Code.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The indictment was preferred by the Attorney General for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> and signed by his agent. Following a lengthy trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for eight and one-half years.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Quebec</span><span lang="EN-CA"> and, before that Court, raised as a ground of appeal that the indictment was a nullity because the Attorney General for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> did not have the right to prefer the indictment. It was the appellant’s contention that only the Attorney General for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Quebec</span><span lang="EN-CA"> had that right. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal upon this ground, and</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 191]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">so did not find it necessary to consider the other grounds of appeal. At the time that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was rendered, the judgment of this Court in <i>R. v. Hauser</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a> had not been delivered.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The right of the Attorney General of Canada to institute these proceedings depends upon the definition of “Attorney General” contained in s.&nbsp;2 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>That definition is as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">“Attorney General” means the Attorney General or Solicitor General of a province in which proceedings to which this Act applies are taken and, with respect to</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Northwest Territories</span><span lang="EN-CA"> and the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Yukon Territory</span><span lang="EN-CA">, and</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>proceedings instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada and conducted by or on behalf of that Government in respect of a violation of or conspiracy to violate any Act of the Parliament of Canada or a regulation made thereunder other than this Act,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">means the Attorney General of Canada and, except for the purposes of subsections&nbsp;505(4) and 507(3), includes the lawful deputy of the said Attorney General, Solicitor General and Attorney General of Canada;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the <i>Hauser </i>case, the accused had been charged on two counts: (1) of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking and (2) of possession of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking. The indictment had been signed by an agent of the Attorney General of Canada. It was contended on behalf of the accused that the enactment of para.&nbsp;(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>of the definition of “Attorney General” was <i>ultra vires </i>of the Parliament of Canada. The constitutional question was settled by the Chief Justice of this Court in these terms:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Is it within the competence of the Parliament of Canada to enact legislation as in Section 2 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>to authorize the Attorney General of Canada or his Agent</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(1) to prefer indictments for an offence under the <i>Narcotic Control Act,</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) to have the conduct of proceedings instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of a violation or conspiracy to violate any Act of the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 192]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Parliament of Canada or regulations made thereunder other than the <i>Criminal Code</i>?</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">(Hereinafter referred to as the “first question” and the “second question”.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The submission of the accused, supported by nine provincial attorneys general, was that the proceedings were criminal in nature and, therefore, could only be instituted by a provincial attorney general. It was contended that this limitation of federal power was by reason of s.&nbsp;92(14) of the <i>British North America Act (B.N.A. Act) </i>which gave to the provincial legislatures exclusive power to legislate in relation to the administration of justice both criminal and civil in the province.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The position taken by the Attorney General of Canada was that the institution of criminal proceedings was within the power of the Attorney General of Canada by virtue of s.&nbsp;91(27) of the <i>B.N.A. Act </i>which gave to the federal Parliament power to legislate in relation to criminal law and procedure in criminal matters. In any event, the proceedings in question were not brought under the <i>Criminal Code, </i>but were brought in respect of a violation of a federal statute (the <i>Narcotic Control Act) </i>other than the <i>Criminal Code, </i>as provided in para.&nbsp;(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>of the definition of “Attorney General”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The appeal was heard by seven judges in this Court. There was a division of opinion with respect to the first question. Pigeon J., speaking for himself and three other members of the Court, answered in the affirmative on the ground that the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>was not enacted pursuant to s.&nbsp;91 (27) of the <i>B.N.A. Act </i>(criminal law) but was enacted under the general residual power in s.&nbsp;91 (peace, order and good government). He expressed the view that the constitutional question, as worded, did not put in issue the broad proposition submitted by the Attorney General of Canada, <i>i.e. </i>complete federal legislative authority over the conduct of all criminal proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Spence J. agreed with the contention of the Attorney General of Canada as to the interpreta-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 193]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">tion of s.&nbsp;91(27) of the <i>B.N.A. Act. </i>He also held that the provincial power under s.&nbsp;92(14) was limited by the words “in the province” and did not include the enforcement and prosecution of breaches of federal statutes. Accordingly, he answered the first question in the affirmative.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The reasons of the other two members of the Court were delivered by Dickson J. whose view was that the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>was, in pith and substance, criminal law and that, in consequence, provincial supervisory control was maintained under s.&nbsp;92(14) of the <i>B.N.A. Act </i>in respect of the prosecution of offences under the <i>Narcotic Control Act. </i>He was of the opinion that the first question should be answered in the negative.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In respect of the answer to the first question, the disagreement between the reasons of Pigeon J. and Dickson J. was as to whether the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>depended for its constitutional validity upon s.&nbsp;91(27) of the <i>B.N.A. Act </i>or upon some other federal power.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">In the result, the issue raised in the first questions was answered in the affirmative by a majority of five to two.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The second question did not relate specifically, as did the first question, to the <i>Narcotic Control Act. </i>By its terms it raised the general question as to whether Parliament had the constitutional authority to enact para.&nbsp;(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>of the definition of “Attorney General” in the <i>Criminal Code.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Pigeon J., for himself and three other members of the Court, answered this question as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Yes, in respect of a violation or conspiracy to violate any Act of the Parliament of Canada or regulations made thereunder the constitutional validity of which does not depend upon head 27 of s.&nbsp;91 of the <i>British North America Act, </i>no opinion being expressed whether the competence of the Parliament of Canada extends beyond that point.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Spence J. answered the second question in the affirmative.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 194]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Dickson J., for himself and another member of the Court, answered this question as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) It is within the competence of the Parliament of Canada to enact legislation, as in s.&nbsp;2 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>to authorize the Attorney General of Canada, or his agent, to act as the “Attorney General”, and indeed the <i>only </i>“Attorney General”, in respect of a violation or conspiracy to violate an Act of Parliament enacted under any head of power in s.&nbsp;91 of the <i>British North America Act, other than </i>head 27 relating to the criminal law power.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The <i>Hauser </i>case has decided that in respect of the enforcement of federal statutes, whose constitutional validity does not depend upon s.&nbsp;91(27) of the <i>B.N.A. Act, </i>the Attorney General of Canada has the right to initiate proceedings for a violation or a conspiracy to violate such statute, and a majority of the Court has decided that the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>is such a statute.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Attorney General of Canada contends that the judgment in the <i>Hauser </i>case should govern the disposition of this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The respondent and the provincial attorneys general who were interveners contend that the <i>Hauser </i>case is not conclusive. It was argued that the <i>Hauser </i>case involved an alleged violation of the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>and was not concerned with a conspiracy to violate that Act. It was submitted that the answer given unanimously to the second question, in so far as it dealt with a conspiracy to violate, was <i>obiter </i>and without binding effect. The argument is that in the present case the respondent was charged with having committed a criminal act in breach of para.&nbsp;423(1)(<i>d</i>)<i> </i>of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>which is an offence separate and distinct from the commission of the offence to which the conspiracy relates. As the offence charged is an offence under the <i>Criminal Code, </i>the Attorney General of Canada does not have authority to institute proceedings in respect of it.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am not in agreement with these contentions.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is clear that the second question formulated by the Chief Justice put in issue the power of the Attorney General of Canada to have the conduct</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 195]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">of proceedings instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of any conspiracy to violate a federal statute other than the <i>Criminal Code. </i>That question was answered unanimously in the affirmative in respect of statutes whose validity was not dependent upon s.&nbsp;91(27) of the <i>B.N.A. Act.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The substance of the answer given to the question is that Parliament can provide for the enforcement of such statutes. This power includes the institution and carriage of proceedings for that purpose.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is true that the charge against the respondent was for conspiracy under para.&nbsp;423(1)(<i>d</i>) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>but it is clear that, had it wished to do so, Parliament could have provided for a conspiracy to violate the Act in the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>itself, as it has done in para.&nbsp;239(1)(<i>e</i>)<i> </i>of the <i>Income Tax Act. </i>This course was not necessary in view of the provision contained in subs. 115(2) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>Section 115 provides:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">115.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) Every one who, without lawful excuse contravenes an Act of the Parliament of Canada by wilfully doing anything that it forbids or by wilfully omitting to do anything that it requires to be done is, unless some penalty or punishment is expressly provided by law, guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) Any proceedings in respect of a contravention of or conspiracy to contravene an Act mentioned in subsection&nbsp;(1), other than this Act, may be instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada and conducted by or on behalf of that Government.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The provision contained in subs. (2) has the same effect as if it had been specifically enacted, in substance, in the <i>Narcotic Control Act. </i>The mere fact that it appears as a general provision in the <i>Criminal Code </i>does not affect its constitutional validity.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Reference may also be made to subs. 27(2) of the <i>Interpretation Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">27.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (2) All the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code </i>relating to indictable offences apply to indictable offences created by an enactment, and all the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code </i>relating to summary conviction offences apply to all other offences created by an enactment,</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 196]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">except to the extent that the enactment otherwise provides.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">“Enactment” is defined as an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or a regulation.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The essence of the matter is that if Parliament can give to the Attorney General of Canada authority to institute proceedings for the enforcement of a federal statute, it is necessarily incidental that, for the proper enforcement of such an Act, it can also institute proceedings for a conspiracy to violate that Act.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In considering this issue, I do not agree with the contention of the respondent that we should consider the charge made against the respondent of conspiring to import narcotics without reference to the offence, <i>i.e. </i>the unlawful importation of narcotics, to which the conspiracy relates. While it is true that conspiracy is, in itself, a crime distinct from the unlawful act to which it relates, we are entitled, in dealing with the constitutional issue before us, to give consideration to the nature of the conspiracy.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The nature of a conspiracy to traffic in narcotics was considered by this Court in <i>Cotroni v. Attorney General of Canada</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[3]</span></span></span></a>.<i> </i>That case involved the validity of a warrant of committal under the <i>Extradition Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21. The charge against the appellant in the </span><span lang="EN-CA">United States</span><span lang="EN-CA"> was for conspiracy to import a narcotic drug. It was contended that conspiring to import a narcotic drug was not listed in Schedule I to the <i>Extradition Act </i>although certain other conspiracies were so listed. Extradition crimes were defined in s.&nbsp;2 of the Act:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">“extradition crime” may mean any crime that, if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of the crimes described in Schedule I; and, in the application of this Act to the case of any extradition arrangement, “extradition crime” means any crime described in such arrangement, whether or not it is comprised in that Schedule;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">By a Supplementary Convention in 1925, there was added a classification, “Crimes and offences against the laws for the suppression of the traffic</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 197]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">in narcotics”. This convention was an “extradition arrangement” within the meaning of the definition in s.&nbsp;2. The question in issue was as to whether a conspiracy to import a narcotic was within the classification defined in the convention. Spence J., who delivered the judgment of this Court, said, at pp. 222-23:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am of the opinion that it matters not whether the particular indictment, had it been laid in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA">, would have been laid under the provisions of the <i>Criminal Code </i>or the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>or in fact any other statute. The test is what is the essence of the crime charged. I am also of the opinion that the essence of the crime charged in the indictment by the United States Grand Jury was and only could be for a crime against the laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It was submitted in argument that the answer to the second question was merely an opinion and did not have binding effect. The answer made was in respect of a constitutional issue raised in the proceedings. It is certainly entitled to the same weight as an answer given to a question posed in a reference to the Court and, as to that, Rinfret C.J. in <i>Attorney General of Canada v. Higbie et al.</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[4]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>after referring to a judgment of this Court, said at p.&nbsp;403:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is needless to mention here that, although this was not a judgment in the true sense of the word, but merely what is sometimes referred to as an opinion made in a Reference to this Court by the Governor General in Council as provided for by section&nbsp;55 of the <i>Supreme Court Act </i>and the special jurisdiction therein given to this Court, we should regard an opinion of that kind as binding upon this Court and, moreover, one which, in the particular circumstances and in view of the wide experience in these matters which must be recognized to Mr.&nbsp;Justice Newcombe, cannot be held but as having the greatest weight and authority.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, we were urged in argument to reconsider and reverse our judgment in the <i>Hauser </i>case. That case was decided on May 1, 1979, after a full argument in which the attorneys general of nine provinces participated. In my opinion, there is no sound reason for now reversing it.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 198]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal. As it appears that the respondent had other grounds of appeal besides the one considered in this Court and not dealt with by the Court of Appeal, I would return the case to the Court of Appeal for consideration of the respondent’s other grounds of appeal.</span></p>
