 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two schools of thought in Canada as to how, and under what circumstances, a person can be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy.&nbsp; The narrower approach (the <i>Trieu</i> model) limits such liability to aiding or abetting the formation of the agreement.&nbsp; The broader approach (the <i>McNamara</i> model) extends such liability to also include aiding or abetting the furtherance of the conspiracy’s unlawful object.&nbsp; The approach to be followed is <i>Trieu </i>and not <i>McNamara</i>.&nbsp; Party liability is limited to cases where the accused aids or abets the initial formation of the agreement, or aids or abets a new member to join a pre‑existing agreement.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Trieu </i>model is a legitimate basis for party liability to a conspiracy.&nbsp; A person becomes party to an offence if he aids or abets a principal in the commission of the offence.&nbsp; It follows that party liability to a conspiracy is made out where the accused aids or abets the <i>actus reus </i>of conspiracy, namely the conspirators’ act of agreeing<i>.</i>&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>McNamara </i>model is not a basis for party liability to conspiracy.&nbsp; Acts that further the unlawful object of a conspiracy are not an element of the offence of conspiracy.&nbsp; Aiding or abetting the furtherance of the unlawful object does not establish aiding or abetting the principal with any element of the offence of conspiracy, and thus cannot ground party liability for conspiracy.&nbsp; However, where a person, with knowledge of a conspiracy, does or omits to do something for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful circumstantial evidence from which membership in the conspiracy can be inferred.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While party liability to conspiracy includes aiding or abetting the formation of a new agreement (the <i>Trieu </i>model), it also includes aiding or abetting a new member to join a pre‑existing agreement.&nbsp; Such assistance or encouragement facilitates the new member’s commission of the offence of conspiracy — that is, the <i>act </i>of agreeing.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the conclusion that party liability does not extend to acts done in furtherance of the unlawful object of the conspiracy, party liability should not, in the present case, have been put to the jury.&nbsp; There is no evidence that J aided or abetted the initial formation of the agreement between R and T to murder their mother or aided or encouraged a new member to join the existing conspiracy.&nbsp; The trial judge’s error, however, could not possibly have affected the verdict.&nbsp; The curative proviso under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>applies.&nbsp; The evidence implicating J as a member of the conspiracy was overwhelming and, once the jury rejected J’s defence, a finding of guilt under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec465subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;465(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> was inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the two grounds of appeal relating to evidence admitted under the co‑conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule are dismissed.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charge of conspiracy to commit murder, for which the appellant stands convicted, revolves around the killing of A.K. by her two daughters R and T.&nbsp; The evidence at the appellant’s trial established that R and T conspired to kill their mother and eventually carried out their plan.&nbsp; R and T were tried as youths and both were convicted of first degree murder.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Case Against the Appellant</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The theory of the Crown against the appellant was that he and T were friends and that he learned from T that she and R were planning to kill their mother.&nbsp; It was their intention to ply her with alcohol, drown her in the family bathtub, and make it look like an accident.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the Crown, the appellant took various steps to help R and T achieve their plan.&nbsp; An MSN chat log, discovered by the police on a computer belonging to R and T, contained a revealing conversation between the appellant and T a few days before the killing.&nbsp; In that conversation, the appellant provided information to T about death by drowning and explained what R and T should do if their mother woke up during the drowning process.&nbsp; He further suggested that in addition to plying their mother with alcohol, R and T should give her about five Tylenol 3 pills as this would “knock [her] right out” (A.R., at p. 198).&nbsp; Autopsy results revealed codeine in A.K.’s blood at 3.5 times the upper therapeutic level — a level consistent with the consumption of four to six Tylenol 3 tablets.&nbsp; The Crown advanced evidence that it was the appellant who supplied R and T with Tylenol 3 tablets shortly before the killing.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the same conversation, the appellant promised to provide R and T with an alibi for the time of the murder and he proposed a plan that he described as “irrefutable”.&nbsp; R and T did not take up the appellant’s suggestion, choosing instead to follow a plan of their own which involved meeting the appellant and another friend at a specified restaurant a short time after the killing.&nbsp; Evidence presented by the Crown showed that the appellant agreed to that suggestion and attended the restaurant as planned.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in the same chat with T, the appellant offered to be present with R and T when the police arrived and he suggested ways in which R and T should behave to mislead the police.&nbsp; At one point in his conversation with T, the appellant made the following telling admission:&nbsp; “I’m involved this much, I’m willing to help you out with any of it [T]” (A.R., at p. 197).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a statement made to the police following his arrest, the appellant did not deny that he was the one communicating with T in the MSN chats; rather, he maintained that he was not being serious and did not expect that his comments would be taken seriously (R.F., at para. 20).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against that backdrop, I turn to what I believe are the two main issues in this appeal, namely:&nbsp; Can a person be a party to the offence of conspiracy <i>as a matter of</i> <i>law</i> and, if so, how and under what circumstances?&nbsp; For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that a person can be a party to the offence of conspiracy as a matter of law under s. 21 of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[17]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The more perplexing issue — and the one that in my view forms the centerpiece of this appeal — is how and under what circumstances.&nbsp; The answer to that question hinges on how one conceptualizes the offence of conspiracy for purposes of party liability.&nbsp; Accepting that the prohibited act in a conspiracy (the <i>actus reus</i>) consists of an agreement by two or more persons to pursue an unlawful object, specifically a criminal offence (<i>R. v. O’Brien</i>, [1954] S.C.R. 666), the question that arises is this:&nbsp; Should party liability be restricted to those who aid or abet the agreement that forms the basis of the conspiracy, or does party liability extend as well to those who aid or abet the furthering of the unlawful object of the conspiracy?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Canadian jurisprudence on the subject is divided.&nbsp; Alberta and Quebec have adopted the narrower approach, restricting party liability to those who aid or abet the agreement itself, with a particular focus on its formation.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Trieu</i>, 2008 ABCA 143, 429 A.R. 200, and <i>R. v. B</i><i>érubé </i>(1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 304 (Que. C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2000] 1 S.C.R. vii.&nbsp; Ontario and British Columbia have adopted the broader approach, expanding party liability to also include those who aid or abet the furthering of the unlawful object.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. McNamara</i> <i>(No. 1)</i> (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Vucetic</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 178 (Ont. C.A.); and <i>United States of America v. Lorenz </i>(2007), 222 C.C.C. (3d) 16 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2008] 1 S.C.R. vi (<i>sub nom.</i> <i>Cheema</i> <i>v. Attorney General of Canada on behalf of the United States of America</i>).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the language of s. 21 suggests that party liability does not apply to offences that punish inchoate behaviour. The appellant’s real complaint, as I understand it, is that party liability ought not to apply to the offence of conspiracy because being a party to a conspiracy “is an offence unknown to the law” (A.F., at para. 41).&nbsp; It suffers from the same problem of remoteness that led this Court in <i>R. v. Déry</i>, 2006 SCC 53, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 669, to conclude that “attempted conspiracy” is not an offence known to law.&nbsp; As Fish J. explained, the separate rationales underlining the offences of “conspiracy” and “attempt” lose their justification when these two forms of inchoate liability are stacked upon one another:&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When applied to conspiracy, the justification for criminalizing attempt is lost, since an attempt to conspire amounts, at best, to a risk that a risk will materialize.&nbsp; [para. 50]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much as the appellant seeks to apply the logic of <i>Dé</i><i>ry</i> to party liability where the offence in issue is conspiracy, I am respectfully of the view that the comparison is inapt — no less so than comparing apples with oranges.&nbsp; Quite simply, unlike the crime of attempt, party liability is not inchoate.&nbsp; In order for the Crown to rely on party liability, the underlying offence must have been committed by the principal.&nbsp; Consequently, being a party to a conspiracy does not involve stacking one form of inchoate liability upon another.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raised this argument before the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; Rosenberg J.A. rejected it for the following reasons, with which I agree:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the holding in <i>Déry </i>does not warrant reconsideration of this court’s decisions in <i>McNamara</i> and <i>Vucetic</i>.&nbsp; Party liability for conspiracy does not suffer from the problem of remoteness identified in <i>Déry</i> with respect to attempt to conspire.&nbsp; A person can be liable as a s.&nbsp;21(1) party to conspiracy <u>only if the Crown proves an agreement by at least two other people to commit a substantive offence.&nbsp; If no agreement materialized, the alleged party’s conduct would be at most an attempt to conspire and would fail on the holding in <i>Déry</i>.</u>&nbsp; If, however, the accused is a party to the conspiracy, . . . the risk of commission of the criminal offence has sufficiently materialized to warrant criminal sanction.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 20.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would accordingly not give effect to this aspect of the appellant’s argument.&nbsp; In short, I am satisfied that being a party to a conspiracy is an offence known to law.&nbsp; The more difficult question, to which I now turn, is how and under what circumstances a person can be found liable as a party to a conspiracy.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The leading authority in support of the narrower view is <i>Trieu</i>.&nbsp; The facts are straightforward.&nbsp; Trieu<i> </i>operated a small business selling cellular phones.&nbsp; He sold phones to five people who were involved in a conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.&nbsp; Trieu knew that the conspirators were engaged in drug trafficking, that they worked as a group, and that they would use the phones in their trafficking operation.&nbsp; He claimed, however, that he was not a member of the conspiracy and denied agreeing with any of the conspirators to traffic in cocaine.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acquitted Trieu (<i>R. v. Lam</i>, 2005 ABQB 849 (CanLII)).&nbsp; In his view, the evidence fell short of establishing that Trieu was a member of the conspiracy.&nbsp; He also rejected the Crown’s alternate theory that in selling cellular phones to the conspirators, Trieu intentionally assisted the conspirators in attaining their object — trafficking in cocaine — and as such, he should be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognizing that there were two lines of authority on the subject, the trial judge adopted the narrower approach.&nbsp; In his view, party liability for the offence of conspiracy did not extend to those who took steps to further the unlawful object of the conspiracy; rather, it was restricted to those who aided in the formation of the agreement that had a particular unlawful object as its goal. &nbsp;And since there was no evidence that Trieu aided in the formation of the agreement hatched by the conspirators, he could not be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed Trieu’s acquittal to the Alberta Court of Appeal, claiming that the trial judge erred in taking the narrower approach to party liability.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal disagreed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the court, Costigan J.A. commenced his analysis by reviewing some of the basic principles applicable to the law of conspiracy and party liability.&nbsp; Citing this Court’s decisions in <i>Papalia v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256, and <i>Sheppe v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 22, he noted that the essence of the offence of conspiracy is the agreement, and acts done in furtherance of the unlawful object are not an element of the offence.&nbsp; He cited <i>R. v. Hibbert</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, for the proposition that “[t]o be a party to an offence, a person must aid the principal in the commission of that offence” (para. 32).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having identified the basic principles that apply to the law of conspiracy and parties, Costigan J.A. turned to the facts of <i>Trieu</i> and commented as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="margin-left:49.5pt;text-indent:27.0pt">It follows from these principles that for Trieu to be a party to the offence of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, the Crown had to prove that Trieu performed acts for the purpose of aiding <u>the formation of an agreement</u> to traffic in cocaine.&nbsp; Acts performed after the agreement was formed did not aid in the commission of the offence of conspiracy on the facts of this case.&nbsp; Therefore, Trieu could not be a party to the offence of conspiracy for facilitating the conspirators in attaining their object of trafficking in cocaine.&nbsp; Although acts performed after the agreement was reached could have aided in the commission of the offence of trafficking, Trieu was not charged with the offence of trafficking.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 33.]</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="margin-left:49.5pt;text-indent:31.5pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Trieu</i> was brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal in the present case.&nbsp; Rosenberg J.A. considered the reasoning underlying the narrower approach endorsed by <i>Trieu</i> but refused to follow it, choosing instead the more expansive approach adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>McNamara</i> and <i>Vucetic</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[35]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At issue in <i>McNamara</i> was whether two individuals and a company were liable as co-conspirators for joining an ongoing bid-rigging scheme operated by a number of pre-existing conspirators.&nbsp; One of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the two individuals and the company could be found liable as parties to the offence of conspiracy.&nbsp; The court answered that question in the affirmative:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:58.5pt">On the other hand, if, at any time before the object of the conspiracy had been attained, that is, the receipt of the contract money from the Crown, [the individuals and the company] abetted or encouraged any of the conspirators to <u>pursue its object</u>, they would become parties to the criminal offence of conspiracy by virtue of s. 21 of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 454.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Vucetic</i>, the Ontario Court of Appeal re-affirmed the expansive approach to party liability endorsed in <i>McNamara</i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:58.5pt">However, in order to find him guilty as an aider and abettor, the jury would have to be instructed that the appellant knew the object of the conspiracy and that his assistance was intended to assist the conspirators <u>in attaining their unlawful criminal object</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 7.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In choosing to follow <i>McNamara</i> and <i>Vucetic</i>, Rosenberg J.A. made the following observations in his reasons:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:27.2pt">Again, I can see no basis in principle for refusing to follow <i>McNamara</i> and <i>Vucetic</i> on this issue.&nbsp; I appreciate the point made in <i>Trieu</i> that the essence of a conspiracy is an agreement, but it is not an agreement in the abstract; it is an agreement to attain a common goal, a particular unlawful object. . . .</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="text-indent:27.2pt">Admittedly, including party liability for aiding or abetting pursuit of the unlawful object blurs the line between the conspiracy and the substantive offence.&nbsp; The distinction, however, is that party liability for conspiracy requires proof of an agreement; there is no requirement of proof that the unlawful object was attained.&nbsp; Liability as a party to the substantive offence requires proof that the substantive offence was committed.&nbsp; Thus, in this case, the appellant could be guilty of conspiracy if he aided or abetted the sisters within the meaning of s. 21(1) to pursue their unlawful object, even if they ultimately did not carry out the plan or the deceased had survived the attempt on her life.&nbsp; [paras. 26 and 27]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To sum up, the cases illustrate two strands of authority.&nbsp; The first, favoured in <i>Trieu</i>, is narrower, grounding party liability on aiding or abetting the agreement itself, specifically its formation.&nbsp; The second, as endorsed in <i>McNamara</i>, is broader, including within the ambit of party liability aiding or abetting the furtherance of the conspiracy’s unlawful object.&nbsp; The question remains which of these two approaches should be adopted.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="text-indent:40.5pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Approach to Be Followed</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The scope of party liability for conspiracy turns on a proper understanding of the elements of the offence of conspiracy.&nbsp; That is because, to be a party to an offence, a person must aid or abet the principals “in the commission of the offence”: <i>R. v. Briscoe</i>, 2010 SCC 13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 16.&nbsp; With respect to the offence of conspiracy, this Court in <i>Papalia</i> held that “[t]he <i>actus reus</i> is the fact of agreement” (p. 276).&nbsp; Aiding or abetting the formation of an agreement between conspirators (as contemplated in <i>Trieu</i>) amounts to aiding or abetting the principals in the commission of the conspiracy, and should therefore lead to party liability for conspiracy.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[41]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows, in my view, that the <i>Trieu</i> model represents a legitimate basis upon which party liability for the offence of conspiracy may be found.&nbsp; I hasten to add that a review of the jurisprudence in Canada and elsewhere reveals that there are few reported cases where the facts have come within the <i>Trieu </i>paradigm.&nbsp; <i>Trieu </i>itself was not such a case.&nbsp; And the only authority that has come to my attention is<i> People v. Strauch</i>, 240 Ill. 60 (1909).&nbsp; In that case, a father introduced his son to another person with the intention that they enter into a conspiracy, which they did.&nbsp; The father was convicted as a party to the conspiracy for aiding and abetting its formation.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[42]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That brings me to the broader approach endorsed in <i>McNamara </i>and the central issue in this appeal — namely, whether party liability can attach to someone who knows of a conspiracy and who does (or omits to do) something for the purpose of furthering its unlawful object.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to those who hold a different view, I have concluded that it should not.&nbsp; Party liability should be restricted to conduct that aids or abets the formation of the <i>agreement</i> that comprises the essence of the crime of conspiracy.&nbsp; In all other cases, a conviction for conspiracy will not lie absent proof of membership in the conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have explained, agreement is a central element to the offence of conspiracy.&nbsp; Conversely, an act done in furtherance of the unlawful object is not an element of the offence of conspiracy.&nbsp; Although such acts can serve as circumstantial evidence to support the existence of a conspiracy, they are not themselves a component of the <i>actus reus</i> of conspiracy.&nbsp; Indeed, a conspiracy can be established in the absence of any overt acts done in furtherance of its unlawful object. In other words, “[t]he crime of conspiracy is complete once the agreement is reached”: <i>Trieu</i>, at para. 31.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows, in my view, that the broader approach as endorsed in <i>McNamara</i> must be rejected.&nbsp; Aiding or abetting the furtherance of the unlawful object does not establish aiding or abetting the principal with any element of the offence of conspiracy.&nbsp; It cannot ground party liability for conspiracy.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">But to aid and abet a crime it is necessary not merely to help the criminal, but to help him in the commission of the particular criminal offense.&nbsp; A person does not aid and abet a conspiracy by helping the “conspiracy” to commit a substantive offense, for the crime of conspiracy is separate from the offense which is its object.&nbsp; It is necessary to help the “conspiracy” in the commission of the crime of conspiracy, <u>that is, in the commission of the act of agreement</u>.&nbsp; Only then is it justifiable to dispense with the necessity of proving commission of the act of agreement by the defendant himself.&nbsp; In all other cases, to convict the defendant of conspiracy it is necessary to prove not only knowledge on his part that he was helping in a wrongful enterprise, but also knowledge on another’s part that he intended to do so, and at least a tacit agreement to give and accept such help.

Alexander </i>(2005), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (Ont. C.A.), a case involving various charges, including conspiracy to extort, Doherty J.A. stated the following:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:.25in">The appellants’ submissions stand on firm legal footing.&nbsp; The <i>actus reus</i> of the crime of conspiracy lies in the formation of an agreement, tacit or express, between two or more individuals, to act together in pursuit of a mutual criminal objective.&nbsp; Co-conspirators share a common goal borne out of a meeting of the minds whereby each agrees to act together with the other to achieve a common goal.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-indent:.25in">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:.25in">It follows from the mutuality of objective requirement of the <i>actus reus</i> that a conspiracy is not established merely by proof of knowledge of the existence of a scheme to commit a crime or by the doing of acts in furtherance of that scheme.&nbsp; Neither knowledge of nor participation in a criminal scheme can be equated with the <i>actus reus</i> of a conspiracy:&nbsp; see <i>R. v. Lamontagne</i> (1999), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 561 (Que. C.A.), at 575-76; <i>R. v. Cotroni</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 17-8.&nbsp; <u>Knowledge and acts in furtherance of a criminal scheme do, however, provide evidence, particularly where they co-exist, from which the existence of an agreement may be inferred.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; citations omitted; paras. 46-47.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">I agree with the emphasized comment, but would state it slightly differently and in somewhat more emphatic terms.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, where a person, with knowledge of a conspiracy (which by definition includes knowledge of the unlawful object sought to be attained), does (or omits to do) something for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful circumstantial evidence from which membership in the conspiracy can be inferred.&nbsp; To be precise, it would be evidence of an agreement, whether tacit or express, that the unlawful object should be achieved.&nbsp; Ultimately, that issue is one for the trier of fact, who must decide whether any inference other than agreement can reasonably be drawn on the evidence.&nbsp; But, as I will explain, the case at hand illustrates how a constellation of such facts can make a finding of membership a virtual certainty.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In so concluding, I note that conspiracies are often proved by way of circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; Direct evidence of an agreement tends to be a rarity.&nbsp; However, it is commonplace that membership in a conspiracy may be inferred from evidence of conduct that assists the unlawful object.&nbsp; Justice Rinfret made this basic point in <i>Paradis</i> <i>v. The King</i>, [1934] S.C.R. 165, some eight decades ago:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Conspiracy, like all other crimes, may be established by inference from the conduct of the parties. No doubt the agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but only in very rare cases will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence.&nbsp; [p. 168]</p>

Genser</i> (1986), 39 Man. R. (2d) 203 (C.A.), aff’d [1987] 2 S.C.R. 685.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; Any degree of assistance in the furtherance of the unlawful object can lead to a finding of membership as long as agreement to a common plan can be inferred and the requisite mental state has been established.</p>

Vu</i>, 2012 SCC 40, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 411.&nbsp; In particular, the Crown maintained that because conspiracy has been identified as a continuing offence (<i>Bell v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 471, at p. 488), party liability can attach to anyone who aids or abets the agreement at any point during the life of the conspiracy.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Trieu</i>, Costigan J.A. opined that because conspiracy is an ongoing crime, party liability can arise after the initial agreement is formed if, for example, a person aids in the addition of a new member to join an existing conspiracy (para. 34).&nbsp; Justice Doherty also took the position that party liability attaches to someone who encourages or assists others to join an existing agreement: “Conspiracies and Attempts”, in National Criminal Law Program, <i>Substantive Criminal Law </i>(1990),&nbsp;vol.&nbsp;1, at p. 37.&nbsp; These authorities observe, and I agree, that aiding or encouraging someone to become a member of a pre-existing conspiracy facilitates that new member’s commission of the offence of conspiracy — that is, the <i>act</i> of agreement.&nbsp; To be consistent in principle, party liability should thus extend to assistance or encouragement that results in the addition of a new member to a pre-existing conspiracy.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Crown argued that the appellant could become a party to the conspiracy by encouraging the sisters to continue their conspiracy when there were signs that they might abandon it (R.F., at para. 34).&nbsp; As well, at least one American author has suggested that a person might be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy “by facilitating the continuance of the conspiracy as by ‘providing the group with a hideout so that it does not have to disband’” (C. R. Williams, “Complicity in a Conspiracy as an Approach to Conspiratorial Liability” (1968), 16 <i>U.C.L.A. L. Rev.</i> 155, at p. 162, citing “Developments in the Law: Criminal Conspiracy”, at pp. 934-35).&nbsp; The same author suggests that “encouraging one or more persons to follow through with already formulated conspiratorial plans” might also attract party liability (p. 162).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant says that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that the co-conspirators’ exception applied only to membership and not to party liability.&nbsp; Once again, defence counsel at trial did not raise this issue with the trial judge.&nbsp; Moreover, the instructions given by the trial judge on the co-conspirators’ exception referred to use of that evidence only to prove membership.&nbsp; There was no suggestion that the evidence could be used to prove party liability.&nbsp; That being so, I would not give effect to this ground.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Furthermore, in light of my conclusion that the facts of this appeal do not give rise to party liability for the offence of conspiracy, this is not an appropriate case to determine how, if at all, the framework for the co-conspirators’ exception established by <i>R. v. Carter</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, might apply in the case of a party to a conspiracy.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a final matter, I note that there are conflicting appellate decisions on the applicability of the co-conspirators’ exception where conspirators are tried separately:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Naicker</i>, 2007 BCCA 608, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 187, leave to appeal refused, [2008] 1 S.C.R. xi; <i>R. v. Simpson</i>, 2007 ONCA 793, 230 C.C.C. (3d) 542, leave to appeal refused, [2008] 2 S.C.R. xi.&nbsp; This issue, however, was not raised before us or in the courts below.&nbsp; Accordingly, I see no need to consider it.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Conclusion</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The aiding and abetting of a conspiracy is an offence known to Canadian law.&nbsp; The offence is made out where the accused aids or abets the <i>actus reus </i>of conspiracy, namely the <i>act of agreeing.</i>&nbsp; It follows that the approach adopted in <i>Trieu</i> is the only basis upon which party liability for the offence of conspiracy may be found.&nbsp; The <i>McNamara</i> approach is rejected.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I caution, however, that the behaviour captured by <i>McNamara </i>may well support a charge of conspiracy.&nbsp; As indicated, where a person with knowledge of a conspiracy does (or omits to do) something for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful circumstantial evidence of his membership in the conspiracy.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[74]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The approach I have adopted brings a measure of simplicity and clarity to the law. &nbsp;Party liability to a conspiracy is limited to cases where the accused encourages or assists in the initial formation of the agreement, or where he encourages or assists new members to join a pre-existing agreement.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[75]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons above, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Appeal from Sentence</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[76]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this Court, the appellant also sought to appeal his sentence, even though he did not apply for or receive leave to do so.&nbsp; I see no basis for granting leave to appeal from sentence.&nbsp; Accordingly, I would not consider the proposed sentence appeal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Appeal dismissed.</i></p>
