It should be regarded, instead, as an assessment of the reasonableness of the inferences to be drawn from the circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; In this case, before committing the accused to trial, the preliminary inquiry judge considered the evidence as a whole, surveying the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown, as well as the allegedly exculpatory evidence tendered by the defence.&nbsp; There is no reason to believe that he arrived at the wrong result in committing the accused to trial. </span></p>

No. 3974 (QL), at para. 69.&nbsp; It was the accused‚Äôs view that a preliminary inquiry judge is required to consider exculpatory evidence.&nbsp; The Crown conceded that a preliminary inquiry judge must evaluate all of the evidence but argued that this did not mean that the judge must weigh evidence to arrive at a ‚Äúnet effect‚Äù.&nbsp; The Crown‚Äôs position was that the task of weighing circumstantial inculpatory evidence against direct exculpatory evidence is a task for the jury, not the preliminary inquiry judge.</p>

Shephard</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080, which held that a preliminary inquiry justice is ‚Äúrequired to commit an accused person for trial in any case in which there is admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction‚Äù.&nbsp; He then stated that the application of the <i>Shephard</i> test to the facts of particular cases ‚Äúhas brought sharp disagreement even at the highest level‚Äù: para. 75.&nbsp; In support of this proposition, he cited this Court‚Äôs decision in <i>R. v. Charemski</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 679, in which both the majority and the dissent affirmed <i>Shephard</i> but the latter went on to state that ‚Äúwhether the evidence is direct or circumstantial, the judge, in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence must, by definition, weigh it‚Äù: <i>Charemski</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 23 (<i>per</i> McLachlin J., dissenting).&nbsp; Lampkin Prov. J. reasoned that this statement reflected a disagreement with the majority position and the traditional common law rule.&nbsp; In his view, the proposition that a preliminary judge must weigh the evidence ‚Äúcomes awfully close to saying that if the evidence presented by the Crown is so weak, the case ought to be withdrawn from the jury‚Äù: para. 85.&nbsp; He therefore rejected the accused‚Äôs contention that the judge must weigh the evidence, holding at para. 96 that</p>

Where the Crown adduces direct evidence on all the elements of the offence, the case must proceed to trial, regardless of the existence of defence evidence, as by definition the only conclusion that needs to be reached is whether the evidence is true.&nbsp; However, where the Crown‚Äôs evidence consists of, or includes, circumstantial evidence, the judge must engage in a limited weighing of the whole of the evidence (i.e.<i> </i>including any defence evidence) to determine whether a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty.</p>

P. Taylor, <i>‚Äú</i>The Test for Committal on the Preliminary Inquiry: U.S.A. v. Shephard -- A View of Sufficency‚Äù (1977), 11 <i>U.B.C. L. Rev.</i> 213, at p. 230 (‚Äúcarried to its logical extreme, the decision in <i>Shephard</i>, unless it is to be limited to cases in which the defense does not offer evidence, would not allow the justice to weigh the evidence of the Crown when compared with the evidence given by the defense‚Äù).&nbsp;</p>

Russell</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 804, 2001 SCC 53, at para. 20.&nbsp; Thus the traditional formulation of the common law rule should not be understood to foreclose consideration of defence evidence.&nbsp; It remains true that in certain cases (such as, for example, where the Crown adduces direct evidence as to every element of the offence) the case will necessarily go to the jury regardless of the exculpatory evidence proffered by the defence.&nbsp; This is the inevitable consequence of the principle that credibility determinations are within the exclusive province of the jury.&nbsp; This result is not inconsistent, however, with the preliminary inquiry judge‚Äôs mandate under s. 548(1).&nbsp; Whatever the evidence of the Crown and defence, the judge must consider ‚Äúthe whole of the evidence‚Äù, in the sense that she must consider whether the evidence, if believed, could reasonably support a finding of guilt.&nbsp; The question is the same whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial.&nbsp; The only difference is that, where the evidence is direct, the evidence will by definition support a finding of guilt, the only remaining question being whether the evidence is to be believed, which is a question for the jury.</p>

J. properly interpreted and applied the law in this case.&nbsp; I have reservations about two aspects of Lampkin Prov. J.‚Äôs reasons.&nbsp; The first is with Lampkin Prov. J.‚Äôs characterization of the dissent in <i>Charemski</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 85 as ‚Äúcom[ing] awfully close to saying that if the evidence presented by the Crown is so weak, the case ought to be withdrawn from the jury‚Äù.&nbsp; Under the traditional common law rule, which I affirmed in <i>Charemski</i>, the preliminary inquiry justice‚Äôs role is limited to determining whether a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty.&nbsp; If the evidence could result in a conviction, the accused must be committed.&nbsp; Otherwise, he must be discharged.&nbsp; The preliminary inquiry justice does not herself draw inferences from the evidence, and she does not assess the credibility of witnesses.&nbsp; Thus it overstates the case to say that a preliminary inquiry justice is entitled to discharge an accused simply on the grounds that the Crown‚Äôs evidence is ‚Äúweak‚Äù.</p>

J.‚Äôs statement at para. 96 that ‚Äúif ‚Äòthere is admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction‚Äô, . . . there must be a committal notwithstanding the presence of exculpatory evidence‚Äù.&nbsp; Again, the statement is too broad.&nbsp; If the Crown‚Äôs case is direct, it is true that the matter is always one for the jury; as by definition there is no inferential gap between direct evidence and the fact to be proved, there is no inference whose reasonableness the preliminary inquiry justice must assess.&nbsp; If, however, the Crown relies on circumstantial evidence, then the preliminary inquiry justice must engage in the limited weighing of the whole of the evidence (i.e. including the defence evidence) to assess whether a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a finding of guilt.</p>

J. reached the wrong result.&nbsp; Before committing the appellant to trial, the preliminary inquiry justice thoroughly surveyed the circumstantial evidence that had been presented by the Crown ‚Äì principally the sighting of a car similar to the appellant‚Äôs on Pine Valley Drive just after 2:00 p.m., the sighting of a man similar in appearance to the accused exiting the car and leaving clothes in the ditch, the D.N.A. evidence linking the accused to the shirt left in the ditch, the foot-imprint evidence linking the accused to the shoes left in the ditch, the evidence that blood on the shirt was Mora‚Äôs, and the evidence that soil on the shoes matched soil found on Mora‚Äôs body and at the presumed murder site.&nbsp; Lampkin Prov. J. also surveyed the evidence proffered by the defence.&nbsp; Indeed, he identified at para. 89 eleven arguments that favoured the accused, including the ‚Äúabsolute and complete absence of any evidence of motive or possibility of gain‚Äù, and the absence of evidence of animus.&nbsp; Only after considering ‚Äúthe evidence as a whole‚Äù did Lampkin Prov. J. commit the appellant to trial.</p>
