The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in T’s case, quashed D’s guilty verdict and ordered a new trial on a charge of second degree murder.&nbsp; However, D negotiated a guilty plea to a reduced charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to 12&nbsp;years in a penitentiary. During its investigation into the activities of the Sûreté du Québec, the Poitras Commission discovered that the police and the Crown had failed to disclose to the accused the existence of a considerable amount of evidence relevant to the defence at the 1991 trial.&nbsp; The accused then appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; After an item-by-item review of the fresh evidence, the court, in two separate judgments, held that there was no sufficient ground to warrant quashing the guilty verdicts and ordering new trials.</span></p>

Moreover, all statements obtained from persons who have provided relevant information to the authorities should be produced notwithstanding that these persons are not proposed as Crown witnesses.&nbsp; Having regard to the substantial amount of evidence that was not disclosed, and to the extremely relevant nature of that evidence, of which the prosecution could not have been unaware, it must be acknowledged that the accused were the victims of a serious infringement of their right to disclosure of evidence.&nbsp; While the jury’s verdict was rendered before the decision in <i>Stinchcombe</i>, the Crown cannot rely on uncertainties in the law relating to the disclosure of evidence to justify the failure to disclose for which it is the focus of criticism in this case.&nbsp; A review of the case law confirms that the duty already existed prior to <i>Stinchcombe</i> as a component of the accused’s right to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; In addition, the duty arises naturally from the Crown attorney’s role as an officer of the court in our criminal justice system.</span></p>

The principles that apply to the admission of fresh evidence discovered after the breach of the duty to disclose were clearly established by this Court in <i>Dixon</i>.&nbsp; The method of analysis prescribed by <i>Dixon</i> consists of two distinct stages.&nbsp; The first stage involves assessing the impact of the fresh evidence on the outcome of the trial.&nbsp; The undisclosed information must be examined to determine the impact it might have had on the decision to convict.&nbsp; The onus is on the accused to demonstrate that there is a reasonable possibility that the verdict might have been different but for the Crown’s failure to disclose all of the relevant evidence.&nbsp; Second, the appellate court must determine whether there was a reasonable possibility that the jury, with the benefit of all of the relevant evidence, might have had a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt.&nbsp; The existence of a reasonable possibility of a different verdict must be determined in the light of the evidence taken as a whole.&nbsp; The appellate court should not examine the undisclosed evidence, item by item, to assess its probative value; that is the role assigned to the trier of fact.&nbsp; Rather, an effort must be made to reconstruct the overall picture of the evidence that would have been presented to the jury. A negative answer at the first stage does not bring the analysis to a close.&nbsp; The second stage requires that the appellate court assess the impact of the fresh evidence on the overall fairness of the trial. It will not be enough to determine whether the right to make full answer and defence has been infringed having regard solely to the nature of the fresh evidence.&nbsp; The potential usefulness of that evidence to the defence will have to be considered.&nbsp; This reasonable possibility of affecting the overall fairness of the trial must be based on reasonably possible uses of the non‑disclosed evidence or reasonably possible avenues of investigation that were closed to the accused as a result of the non-disclosure.&nbsp; Here again, the appellate court must not assess the possible uses of the fresh evidence based on an item-by-item analysis of the probative value of the evidence.&nbsp; It must ascertain whether the failure to disclose deprived the accused of certain evidential or investigative resources.&nbsp; The infringement of the right to make full answer and defence may arise from a reasonable possibility that the failure to disclose had an impact on the overall fairness of the trial, even if it cannot be concluded that the verdict might have been different.</span></p>

Many parts of the fresh evidence could have been used by the defence at trial, whether to impeach the credibility of certain witnesses and the credibility of the Crown’s theory or to gather new evidence.&nbsp; In D’s case, the Court of Appeal erred when it applied a subjective test in determining whether there was a reasonable possibility that D would have decided not to stand trial again if he had known about the undisclosed evidence.&nbsp; The test is what the reasonable person in the same situation would have done.&nbsp; The court did not give any attention to the reasonable possibilities of using the fresh evidence that were available to the defence and to the effect of such possibilities on a reasonable decision to take the risk of a second trial.&nbsp; In the circumstances of this case, having regard to the volume, weight and relevance of the undisclosed evidence and the new possibilities that the opportunity to use that evidence would have offered, it does not seem unreasonable to think that an accused, armed with a more solid defence than at his first trial, at which the&nbsp; jury deliberations had lasted 14&nbsp;days, would have hesitated to admit his guilt or would have had more confidence about standing trial a second time. <i>&nbsp;</i>The Crown’s breach of its duty to disclose all of the relevant evidence cast doubt on the validity of the accused’s admission of guilt and the waiver of the presumption of innocence that a guilty plea involves.&nbsp; The constitutional right of the accused to make full answer and defence has been seriously infringed<i>.</i></span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The appropriate and just remedy for an infringement of the right to make full answer and defence arising out of the Crown’s breach of its duty to disclose must be determined on the basis of the seriousness of the infringement.&nbsp; Where the breach of that duty results in an infringement of the accused’s right to make full answer and defence, ordering a new trial will be the minimum remedy. A stay of proceedings is ordered only in exceptional circumstances, where the accused has demonstrated that the infringement of the right is irreparable.&nbsp; In T’s case, the appropriate and just remedy in the circumstances is committal for a new trial on the charge of a first degree murder.&nbsp; It would be premature to order a stay of proceedings, in the case of such a serious crime, where the charge is still first degree murder.&nbsp; The transcripts of all of the testimony given at the preliminary inquiry and the first trial are still available.&nbsp; As well, at this stage in the case, we can only speculate as to the prejudice that the accused would suffer by reason of the impeachment of the witnesses’ credibility and the loss of opportunities for investigation.&nbsp; While the infringement of the accused’s rights might be characterized as very serious, it certainly appears to result from an incorrect understanding of the nature and scope of the duty of disclosure.&nbsp; In the event that the trial judge determines that the accused cannot be given a fair trial, that judge could exercise his or her discretion at any time and order a stay of proceedings.&nbsp; On the particular facts of D’s case, a stay of the proceedings is the appropriate remedy.&nbsp; Ordering a new trial when the accused has already served two thirds of his sentence and is eligible for parole would contribute to perpetuating an injustice and would tarnish the integrity of our judicial system.&nbsp; The accused has already effectively spent the time in prison that is normally imposed in the case of any term to which he might be sentenced if he were convicted.&nbsp; This is plainly one of those cases where the need to avoid offending fair play and decency prevails over society’s interest in the prosecution of criminal cases.&nbsp; There is no other remedy that would cure the prejudice suffered by D.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;759, which sets out the requirements for admitting fresh evidence on appeal.&nbsp; Before permitting the guilty plea to be withdrawn, [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “the Court must be persuaded, after examining the evidence now in the record, that together with the other evidence adduced at trial, the fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the result and prompted the appellant to run the risk of a second trial on a murder charge” (para.&nbsp;59).</p>

Egger</i>, [1993] 2&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;451, at p.&nbsp;467:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">One measure of the relevance of information in the Crown’s hands is its usefulness to the defence: if it is of some use, it is relevant and should be disclosed — <i>Stinchcombe</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;345.&nbsp; This requires a determination by the reviewing judge that production of the information can reasonably be used by the accused either in meeting the case for the Crown, advancing a defence or otherwise in making a decision which may affect the conduct of the defence such as, for example, whether to call evidence.</p>

C. (M.H.)</i>, [1991] 1&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;763, which was decided a few months before <i>Stinchcombe</i>, this Court had defined the parameters of the duty to disclose evidence that the Crown was under at common law.&nbsp; McLachlin&nbsp;J. (as she then was), writing for the Court, had observed that the Crown’s common law duty to disclose to the defence “all material evidence whether favourable to the accused or not” had repeatedly been recognized by this Court (p.&nbsp;774).&nbsp; In support of her opinion, she cited <i>Lemay v. The King</i>, [1952] 1&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;232, <i>Duke v. The Queen</i>, [1972]&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;917, and <i>Caccamo v. The Queen</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786.&nbsp; She had stressed the potential importance of a breach of that duty to the overall fairness of a criminal trial (at pp.&nbsp;774-75):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
24.45pt;line-height:12.2pt">It is not necessary on the facts of this case to establish the exact ambit of the Crown’s duty of disclosure.&nbsp; It is sufficient to note that failure to disclose may constitute grounds for appeal where it results in an unfair trial. As Spence J. observed in his reasons in <i>Caccamo</i> (dissenting on another ground, Laskin C.J. concurring), courts must not hesitate to interfere where conduct of the Crown suggests there was unfairness at trial, at p.&nbsp;796:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
24.45pt;line-height:12.2pt">In my view, it is the duty of the court to be vigilant to assure itself that the appellant has had a fair trial and if the regrettable conduct of the prosecution, using that term to cover both the police and Crown counsel, ever results in unfairness then the court should act with decisiveness to reverse such unfairness.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
24.45pt;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, the failure of the Crown in this case to disclose either the statement or the existence of the potential witness created such prejudice against the appellant that it cannot be said with certainty that he received a fair trial.</p>

La Reine</i>, [1989] R.J.Q. 2023, the accused alleged that the Crown had not disclosed its intention to introduce the incriminating statements he had made to the police within a reasonable time, thereby depriving him of the right to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; After reviewing the law applicable to the disclosure of evidence, I had summarized the law as it then stood, as follows (at p. 2032):</p>

La</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680, at para. 27:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The appropriateness of a stay of proceedings depends upon the effect of the conduct amounting to an abuse of process or other prejudice on the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; This is often best assessed in the context of the trial as it unfolds.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial judge has a discretion as to whether to rule on the application for a stay immediately or after hearing some or all of the evidence.&nbsp; Unless it is clear that no other course of action will cure the prejudice that is occasioned by the conduct giving rise to the abuse, it will usually be preferable to reserve on the application.&nbsp; This will enable the judge to assess the degree of prejudice and as well to determine whether measures to minimize the prejudice have borne fruit.</p>

Conway</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667; <i>O’Connor</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 69).&nbsp; Although there is a considerable quantity of undisclosed and undeniably relevant evidence, the evidence does not show that the Crown acted in bad faith, out of improper motives or in any other way that would have the effect of tarnishing the integrity of our system of justice (<i>O’Connor</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 69).&nbsp; While the infringement of the accused’s rights might even be characterized as very serious, it certainly appears to result from an incorrect understanding of the nature and scope of the duty of disclosure.&nbsp; In this case the need for the precedent provided by this Court in <i>Stinchcombe</i> can be readily appreciated.</p>

Young</i> (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289; <i>R. v. Keyowski</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, at pp. 658-59; <i>R. v. Mack</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 941; <i>R. v. Power</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at pp. 615-16).&nbsp; In this case, in my opinion, the need to avoid offending fair play and decency prevails over society’s interest in the prosecution of criminal cases.&nbsp; This Court is faced here with one of those situations in which the proper administration of justice will be best served by a stay of proceedings (<i>Conway</i>, at p. 1667).&nbsp; A resumption of the proceedings, so that the trial judge could find, at the end of those proceedings, that the accused has already effectively spent the time in prison that is normally imposed in the case of any term to which he might be sentenced if he were convicted does not seem to be in the public interest in any sense, and places an excessive burden on the appellant.&nbsp; At some point or other, in circumstances like these, a stay of proceedings seems to be virtually inevitable.</p>
