The preliminary question of war crimes or crimes against humanity is more of a political inquiry than one of culpability and accordingly does not traditionally fall within the province of the jury.&nbsp; The international community actively encourages the prosecution of those whose criminal conduct also constitutes war crimes or crimes against humanity.</span></p>

Commonwealth of Australia</i> (1991), 101 A.L.R. 545 (Aust. H.C.).&nbsp; Another technique is to enable prosecution under domestic law by the device of deeming the acts constituting a war crime or crime against humanity to have been committed in Canada.&nbsp; Since these acts are then deemed to have been committed in Canada, the person accused of having committed them may be charged with any of the relevant underlying offences that encompass these acts under the law of Canada.&nbsp; That is the course that was taken by Parliament, an approach somewhat similar to that followed in Great Britain; see <i>War Crimes Act 1991</i>, 1991 (U.K.), c. 13.&nbsp; By section 7(3.71), a provision cited and discussed at length later, Parliament provided that a person who has committed an act or omission outside Canada that constitutes a war crime or crime against humanity shall be deemed to have committed that act in Canada.&nbsp; The provision adds a second requirement for the operation of this clause.&nbsp; To avoid punishing someone for an act that would not at the time have been a crime under Canadian law, it further requires that the act must constitute a crime in Canada according to the law at the time, a provision reinforced by s. 7(3.72) which requires that any prosecution in respect of such act be conducted according to the then existing laws of evidence and procedure.</span></p>

C. Green, <i>International Law:&nbsp; A Canadian Perspective</i> (2nd ed. 1988), Part VI, at §§ 359-64.</span></p>

DeSousa</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at pp. 964-65, this Court held that reading in such a requirement for every element of an offence misconstrues and overgeneralizes earlier decisions of this Court.&nbsp; Rather, the proper approach, it noted, was that "there must be an element of personal <u>fault in regard to a culpable aspect</u> of the <i>actus reus</i>, but not necessarily in regard to each and every element of the <i>actus reus</i>" (p. 965).

The King</i>, [1905] 2 K.B. 391, at p. 402, they also render "valuable service in helping to create the opinion by which the range of the consensus of civilized nations is enlarged".&nbsp; But, as he went on to add (at p. 402), "in many instances their pronouncements must be regarded rather as the embodiments of their views as to what ought to be... the conduct of nations <i>inter se</i>, than the enunciation of a rule or practice as universally approved or assented to [by nation states] as to be fairly termed .&nbsp;. . `law'".&nbsp;&nbsp; In a word, international conventions and the practices adopted and approved as law by authoritative decision makers in the world community, along with the general principles of law recognized by civilized countries are what constitute the principal sources of international law.&nbsp; The pronouncements of learned writers on international law are extremely useful in setting forth what these practices and principles are, but the personal views of learned writers in the field, though useful in developing consensus, are of a subsidiary character in determining what constitutes international law.&nbsp; This approach, which is universally accepted by the international community, is authoritatively set down in Art. 38(1) of the <i>Statute of the International Court of Justice</i> which reads:</span></p>

Y.B. Int'l L.</i> 178, at pp. 196-97, almost all the serious crimes of the municipal law of civilized nations are also in some basic sense culpable offences in the minds of humanity; for a similar view, see Law Reform Commission of Canada, <i>Our Criminal Law</i> (1976), at pp. 3, 5 and 7.&nbsp; The additional conditions of the <i>actus reus</i> requirement under international law are intended to be used to ascertain whether the factual conditions are such that the international relations concerns of extraterritorial limits do not arise.&nbsp; Since in almost all if not every case the <i>mens rea</i> for the war crime or crime against humanity will be captured by the <i>mens rea</i> required for the underlying offence that will have to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge will rarely, if ever, have to make any additional findings in relation to the <i>mens rea</i> to satisfy the jurisdiction requirements.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">I do not take our reasons in <i>Vaillancourt</i>, <i>supra</i>, to have dictated a necessary standard of proof or to have required that the jury decide certain matters, in cases of special stigma, in order to accord with the principles of fundamental justice.&nbsp; As I read it, the Court viewed certain offences, which import a high degree of stigma, as demanding a higher degree of <i>mens rea</i>, on a substantive level, reflecting the nature of the relevant offence.&nbsp; The debate arises on a substantive, not a procedural plane.&nbsp; The issue is one of finding where, on the objective-to-subjective scale of intent, a particular offence falls.&nbsp; Our assessment of fundamental justice in <i>Vaillancourt</i>, <i>supra</i>, and in all subsequent cases, did not lead us to conclude that because a special stigma might attach to certain offences, only the jury is to be entrusted with finding <i>mens rea</i> and only on a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; I note that in <i>R. v. Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, this Court has held that a hearing for the "labelling" of a convicted person as a dangerous criminal does not require the determination of dangerousness&nbsp; by a jury, though such a determination clearly carries a serious stigma.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme set up by Parliament in s. 7(3.71)-(3.77) of the <i>Code</i> does not deprive the accused of his or her rights in a manner inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice.&nbsp; The accused cannot be found guilty of the offence with which he or she was charged, i.e., the underlying domestic offence, unless the jury finds the relevant mental element on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, a mental element which, we saw, coincides with that of the war crime or crime against humanity.&nbsp; And if any excuse, justification or defence for the act arises under international law, the accused is entitled to the benefit of any doubt about the matter, including any relevant <i>mens rea</i> attached to such excuse, justification or defence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The question, in the eyes of the Court of Appeal, thus was properly left to the jury.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, Canada always has an interest, or a moral claim, in bringing those who commit acts that it regards as offensive behaviour to justice.&nbsp; Conduct is not viewed as any less culpable merely because it is committed abroad; murder of anybody anywhere is something we find abhorrent.&nbsp; This is reflected, as I earlier noted, in our laws of immigration and extradition.&nbsp; However, because of Canada's respect for the underlying premises of international relations, i.e., comity and respect for the sovereignty of independent states, a self-imposed limit is placed on its ability to prosecute these culpable acts when committed outside its territory.&nbsp; As part of our respect for sovereignty and part of our confidence in the standards of other nations, we would normally expect that other nations would punish the culpable conduct.&nbsp; Such a limit is also justified on the basis of efficacy of prosecution; it is usually more efficient and effective to prosecute in the place where the criminal act actually occurred.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we should never forget that, throughout, in our view, this conduct constitutes culpable conduct in violation of our legal standards.&nbsp; This perspective is reflected in s. 6 of the <i>Code</i>, explored above.&nbsp; The general principle embodied therein does not strip extraterritorially committed offences of their culpability in Canadian eyes; rather, the ability to convict or to discharge is removed.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concern towards which the jurisdictional portion of s. 7(3.71) is directed is, rather, the determination of the appropriate court to hear the case.&nbsp; Put another way, the inquiry goes to assessing whether Canadian courts are able to convict or discharge the perpetrator of the relevant conduct.&nbsp; The international community agreed, presumably because of the general revulsion for these types of conduct and their recognition of the need for cooperation because of the difficulty in bringing offenders to justice in the place where they were committed, that war crimes and crimes against humanity presented cases worthy of exception to the general concerns of international law.&nbsp; The preliminary question in s. 7(3.71), whether the relevant conduct constitutes a situation evaluated by the international community to constitute one warranting treatment exceptional to the general precepts of international law, involves an assessment of Canada's international obligations and other questions concerning the interrelationship of nations.&nbsp; The culpability of the acts targeted by this provision, from Canada's perspective, arises from, and will be assessed according to our standards of offensive behaviour as embodied in the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; In the absence of international accord, we would still have found the conduct criminal and culpable, but for other policy reasons, would not have prosecuted in our courts.&nbsp; It is this domestic evaluation of culpability that served as the instigator for Canada's agreement to be bound by international conventions in this area.&nbsp; The decision to&nbsp; give Canadian courts jurisdiction in the case of war crimes and crimes against humanity, as is the case in the other situations of extraterritorial jurisdiction granted in s. 7 of the <i>Code</i>, is based not on culpability, but on other often totally unrelated policy considerations.&nbsp; The preliminary question of war crime or crime against humanity is more of a political inquiry than one of culpability.&nbsp; As such, the issue is not one that is viewed as traditionally falling within the province of the jury.&nbsp; Admittedly, the standard used to determine whether these exceptional cases are present is one of international "crimes".&nbsp; However, this does not take away from the fact that the considerations underlying this determination will involve questions of international obligations, with which the trial judge is better equipped to deal.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 178, a case concerning Canadian criminal jurisdiction.&nbsp; I there noted that the concerns of international comity normally called for restraint in the extraterritorial application of Canadian criminal law.&nbsp; But I added that, in the context there, the dictates of international comity were not offended because there was a substantial Canadian element in the criminal activities involved.&nbsp; Moreover, I noted that our respect for the interest of other states was in fact served by assisting in the prosecution of offences having a transnational impact on other states.&nbsp; In an increasingly interdependent world, I observed (at p. 214), "we are all our brother's keepers" ‑‑ we are all responsible for the welfare of those in other societies.&nbsp; Nowhere can our international responsibility be more at stake than in the situation of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&nbsp; The international community has not only stated that it does not object to our exercising jurisdiction in this field; it actively encourages the prosecution of those whose criminal conduct also constitutes war crimes or crimes against humanity.&nbsp; From the sheer viewpoint of our moral responsibility, I fail to see any injustice in prosecuting these crimes in accordance with our normal criminal procedures.</span></p>

The difficulty lies in determining what are `general principles of law' and what percentage of the world's States constitutes a sufficient proportion to be considered `the community of nations'.&nbsp; Does this collection have to include every major power or be representative of all the leading legal systems of the world?</span></p>

J. Fenrick, "The Prosecution of War Criminals in Canada" (1989), 12 <i>Dalhousie L.J.</i> 256, at pp. 273-74.&nbsp; However, no such international justifications, excuses or defences are claimed here, and none applies.</span></p>

C. Green; see, for example, <i>Superior Orders in National and International Law</i> (1976).&nbsp; The defence is not simply based on the idea of obedience or authority of <i>de facto</i> national law, but rather on a consideration of the individual's responsibilities as part of a military or peace officer unit.&nbsp; For these reasons, such a defence can be considered by the jury, and is not excluded under s. 7(3.74).</span></p>

C. Green,"The Defence of Superior Orders in the Modern Law of Armed Conflict" (1993), 31 <i>Alta. L.

Penno</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 865.&nbsp; Less controversially, justifications and excuses are commonly restricted in their application, and there is no suggestion that this violates the principles of fundamental justice.&nbsp; For example, s. 14 of the <i>Code</i> prevents the operation of the defence of consent in relation to offences of causing death.</span></p>

Sault Ste. Marie</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299), to a constitutionally required element (<i>R. v.

Vaillancourt</i>, <i>supra</i>, this Court held that there are certain crimes where, because of the special nature of the available penalties or of the stigma attached to a conviction, the principles of fundamental justice require a mental blameworthiness or a <i>mens rea</i> reflecting the particular nature of that crime.&nbsp; It follows that the question which must be answered is not simply whether the accused is morally innocent, but rather, whether the conduct is sufficiently blameworthy to merit the punishment and stigma that will ensue upon conviction for that particular offence.&nbsp; In the present case there must be taken into account not only the stigma and punishment that will result upon a conviction for the domestic offence, but also the additional stigma and opprobrium that will be suffered by an individual whose conduct has been held to constitute crimes against humanity or war crimes.&nbsp; In reality, upon conviction, the accused will be labelled a war criminal and will suffer the particularly heavy public opprobrium that is reserved for these offences.&nbsp; Further the sentence which will follow upon conviction will reflect the high degree of moral outrage that society very properly feels toward those convicted of these crimes.</span></p>

DeSousa</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, while it is not a principle of fundamental justice that fault or <i>mens rea</i> must be proved as to each separate element of the offence, there must be a meaningful mental element demonstrated relating to a <u>culpable aspect</u> of the <i>actus reus</i>.&nbsp; See also:&nbsp; <i>R. v.

Cherif Bassiouni, testified that at the time the offences were alleged to have been committed, "state action or policy" was a pre-requisite legal element of crimes against humanity.&nbsp; Thus, in my view, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that they had to be satisfied that Finta knew or was aware of the particular factual circumstance which rendered the acts he was alleged to have committed crimes against humanity.&nbsp; The trial judge properly distinguished this factor from motive which, he clearly indicated to the jury, the Crown did not have to establish.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220).&nbsp; A defence should not be put to the jury if a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would have been unable to acquit on the evidence presented in support of that defence.&nbsp; However, if a reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit on the basis of the evidence giving rise to the defence, then the defence must be put to the jury.&nbsp; It is for the trial judge to decide whether the evidence is sufficient to give rise to the defence as this is a question of law (<i>Parnerkar v. The Queen</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 449; <i>Dunlop v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 881).&nbsp; There is thus a two-stage process to be followed.&nbsp; The trial judge must look at all the evidence to consider its sufficiency.&nbsp; Then, if the evidence meets the threshold, it should be put before the jury which will weigh it and decide whether it raises a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; See:&nbsp; <i>Wigmore on Evidence</i> (1983), vol. IA, at pp. 968-69; <i>R. v. Faid</i>, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p.&nbsp;276.&nbsp; This is all that is meant by the requirement of sufficient evidence.</span></p>

Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740.&nbsp; The evidence of Dallos meets all these criteria and was therefore admissible.</span></p>

The fact that D was acting under orders may, nevertheless, be very relevant.&nbsp; It may negative <i>mens rea</i> by, for example, showing that D was acting under a mistake of fact or that he had a claim of right to do as he did, where that is a defence; or, where the charge is one of negligence, it may show that he was acting reasonably.</span></p>

Penno</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 865) it is not a violation of s. 7 to limit the use that can be made of the defence of obedience to superior orders.</span></p>

(Prostitution Reference</i>), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, it was held that it is not fatal that a particular legislative term is open to varying interpretations by courts.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, it was stated that the threshold for finding a law vague is relatively high.&nbsp; There Gonthier J. provided guidance for determining whether a provision is so vague that it violates the principle of legality in these words at p.&nbsp;639:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">And later, at p.&nbsp;643 he stated:</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">... the limited and qualified character of the rule on crimes against humanity as formulated in the Charters of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals militates against the rule being accepted as one declaratory of international customary law.&nbsp; This rudimentary legal system [of international law] does not know of distinctions as subtle as those between crimes against humanity which are connected with other types of war crime and, therefore, are to be treated as analogous to war crimes in the strict sense and other types of inhumane acts which are not so linked and, therefore, are beyond the pale of international law.&nbsp; The Four-Power Protocol of October 6, 1945, offers even more decisive evidence of the anxiety of the Contracting Parties to avoid any misinterpretation of their intentions as having codified a generally applicable rule of international customary law.</span></p>
