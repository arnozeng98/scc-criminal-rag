   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused, Y, and D.S., the co-accused shooter, were charged with first degree murder after a failed drug deal.&nbsp; D.S. was tried separately as a young offender. &nbsp;He pleaded guilty to second degree murder.&nbsp; As part of his plea agreement, D.S. signed a written Agreed Statement of Facts (ASF) drafted by Crown counsel, with input from defence counsel.&nbsp; The ASF directly implicated Y in the murder.&nbsp; At the time of his plea, D.S. acknowledged the accuracy of the ASF.&nbsp; The ASF was neither videotaped nor preceded by sworn oath or affirmation. &nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During Y’s trial, the Crown asked D.S. to adopt the ASF.&nbsp; D.S. testified that he could not remember signing the document, but acknowledged that it bore his signature.&nbsp; D.S. further denied the facts in the ASF implicating Y.&nbsp; In response to D.S.’s denials, the Crown sought to adduce the ASF for the truth of its contents.&nbsp; Following a <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge found insufficient means for the jury to assess the reliability of the ASF as a prior inconsistent statement and ruled the signed ASF did not meet the threshold reliability required for it to be admissible as evidence for the truth of its contents.&nbsp; When D.S. asserted solicitor-client privilege, the ability to cross-examine was curtailed and the trial judge found the opportunity for an effective cross-examination at trial was to a large extent illusory.&nbsp; The trial judge granted the defence’s application for a directed order acquitting Y.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i> (Rothstein and Wagner&nbsp;JJ. dissenting): &nbsp;The appeal should be allowed and the acquittal restored.</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</i> McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. and Fish, Abella, Cromwell and Karakatsanis&nbsp;JJ.: &nbsp;A prior inconsistent statement of a non-accused witness may be admitted for the truth of its contents if the following reliability indicia are met: &nbsp;(1)&nbsp;the statement is made under oath or solemn affirmation after a warning as to possible sanctions if the person is untruthful; (2)&nbsp;the statement is videotaped or recorded in its entirety; and (3)&nbsp;the opposing party has a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness on the statement.&nbsp; The prior inconsistent statement’s threshold reliability may also be established by: &nbsp;(1)&nbsp;the presence of adequate substitutes for testing truth and accuracy (procedural reliability); and (2)&nbsp;sufficient circumstantial guarantees of reliability or an inherent trustworthiness (substantive reliability).&nbsp; A trial judge is well-placed to assess the hearsay dangers in a particular case and the effectiveness of any safeguards to assist in overcoming them. &nbsp;Thus, absent an error in principle, the trial judge’s determination of threshold reliability is entitled to deference. &nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge did not err in finding that there were insufficient safeguards to establish threshold reliability to admit the ASF as evidence for the truth of its contents.&nbsp; Only a full and complete opportunity to cross-examine would have provided a genuine basis on which to assess the reliability of D.S.’s statements.&nbsp; D.S.’s invocation of solicitor-client privilege, however, curtailed significantly the cross-examination available to assess the threshold reliability of the prior inconsistent statement.&nbsp; The Crown could not have probed the conversations between D.S. and his counsel about legal advice in connection with his decision to plead guilty or to accept the ASF.&nbsp; The trial judge may have overstated the scope of solicitor-client privilege and its consequences for the cross-examination of D.S.; however, any overstatement would not have had a material impact on the conclusion that cross-examination was not, in this case, a sufficient means to satisfy threshold reliability. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown cannot ask for a new trial on the basis that the prosecution should have been conducted differently.&nbsp; The trial judge did not preclude the Crown from conducting a more probing cross-examination of the witness or from calling other witnesses about the creation of the ASF.&nbsp; The trial judge made no comments suggesting that there should be no further cross-examination of the witness on the <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; The judge was not asked for a ruling on this issue.&nbsp; Had Crown counsel wished to call further evidence, he could have sought direction.&nbsp; Since this was the same Crown counsel who had prosecuted D.S. at his separate youth trial, and who negotiated the plea bargain and drafted the ASF, he knew what D.S. or his lawyers could say about those matters, outside the scope of solicitor-client privilege. &nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge did not err in finding that the circumstances surrounding the making of the prior inconsistent statement did not provide sufficient guarantees of substantive reliability.&nbsp; The circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness asserted by the Crown — the thorough process in creating the ASF, the involvement of counsel, and the solemnity of the guilty plea proceeding — do not establish threshold reliability for the statements from which D.S. recanted, which served to minimize his involvement in the murder and shift responsibility to Y. &nbsp;In the circumstances of this case, the formality of the process and the involvement of counsel only provide comfort in respect of D.S.’s statements admitting his own culpability for the murder.&nbsp; The administration of justice would not be enhanced in permitting admissions made by a co-accused in his own interest, as part of a plea bargain for a conviction of a lesser crime and favourable sentence, to be used against a co-accused, in circumstances where the reliability of the statements cannot be adequately tested.</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>Rothstein and Wagner&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting): &nbsp;Threshold reliability should be generously interpreted in the admissibility inquiry.&nbsp; As a general rule, if a statement is accepted for its truth by the courts, and used to balance the liberty interests of the accused with societal considerations such as deterrence and retribution, then that statement provides a level of implicit reliability that warrants consideration in the admissibility inquiry in a subsequent third-party trial.&nbsp; That is not to say that a statement’s use and judicial acceptance at a prior proceeding is sufficient in and of itself to meet the reliability requirement of the principled approach.&nbsp; Rather, it is merely a factor that must be considered in the admissibility inquiry, a factor that goes towards meeting the threshold reliability standard.&nbsp; Each case will have to be examined on its particular circumstances when determining threshold reliability, but consideration should certainly be given to the general acceptance of and reliance on statements read in as part of a guilty plea.&nbsp; Limits on cross-examination should not be applied rigidly and absolutely where solicitor-client privilege is asserted.&nbsp; Rather, issues of privilege should be addressed as they arise on cross-examination.&nbsp; This way, relevant information that may not be prohibited by the assertion of privilege may still be elicited, furthering the underlying truth-seeking function of the proceedings. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of admissibility in this case must be redetermined in a new trial where threshold reliability can be properly assessed.&nbsp; The trial judge erred in his determination that the ASF did not meet the standard of threshold reliability.&nbsp; He failed to adequately assess the available indicia of reliability and erroneously found the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. to be illusory.&nbsp; That is not to say that the circumstances in this case provide sufficient evidence to conclusively determine that the ASF should be admitted.&nbsp; Rather, the admissibility inquiry was incomplete and did not provide a proper basis for the trial judge to exclude the relevant evidence.&nbsp; The opportunity to cross-examine D.S. was not entirely closed and the trial judge misapprehended the scope and impact of solicitor-client privilege on the opportunity for cross-examination.&nbsp; Had the trial judge permitted the cross-examination to proceed and addressed issues involving solicitor-client privilege as they arose, information sufficient to meet the threshold reliability standard may have been brought forward.&nbsp; D.S. was available for cross-examination, he recalled having made many of the statements within the ASF, he did not dispute understanding the key facts in the ASF which he subsequently denied at Y’s trial, and he recalled the ASF being read in at his guilty plea proceeding.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other factors were available in this case that could have satisfied the trial judge that the circumstances surrounding the drafting and reading in of the ASF provided assurances of reliability equivalent to an oath and presence.&nbsp; If these indicia had been considered and cross-examination had been permitted, it is possible that threshold reliability would have been met.&nbsp; Perhaps the most persuasive indicia of reliability are the nature of the statement and how it was constructed.&nbsp; The ASF tendered as evidence in D.S.’s guilty plea proceeding provides just such a record.&nbsp; Having been reduced to writing, signed not only by D.S. but by both Crown and defence counsel, and having been read in to the record in the context of D.S.’s guilty plea, the source of the document cannot be disputed.&nbsp; This was not a statement that was unilaterally drafted and forced upon D.S. to adopt.&nbsp; Rather, the drafting of the ASF was a collaborative effort where there is evidence that at least one crucial component to the Crown’s case against Y was supplied by defence counsel — namely the statement that Y supplied D.S. with the gun.&nbsp; Moreover, D.S. had the opportunity to review the ASF with his counsel prior to signing it and adopting it.&nbsp; This is an important aspect as it refutes any negative inferences that could be drawn against the ASF on the grounds that it was not captured in D.S.’s own words or that D.S. did not understand its contents.&nbsp; Perhaps most importantly, D.S. testified that he understood the three crucial components of the ASF, namely that Y gave D.S. the gun, Y told D.S. to shoot the victim, and demanded that D.S. return the gun.&nbsp; Without more persuasive evidence to the contrary, this essentially forecloses any argument that D.S. lacked understanding of the ASF’s contents.&nbsp; Looking beyond the construction of the ASF, the context of the proceedings under which it was read in to court and the contents of the ASF itself provide additional indicia supporting threshold reliability.&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s theory was that the appellant planned the murder and provided the murder weapon to the co-accused shooter.&nbsp; The shooter, in a separate proceeding in youth court, pleaded guilty to second degree murder.&nbsp; In doing so, he adopted a written Agreed Statement of Facts (ASF) in which he shifted responsibility for planning the murder and for obtaining the murder weapon to the appellant.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a witness in the appellant’s murder trial, the shooter resiled from those facts inculpating the appellant and refused to adopt the prior statement.&nbsp; The Crown’s case against the appellant collapsed when the trial judge found that the ASF did not meet the threshold reliability required to be admitted for the truth of its contents.</p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.S. was tried separately as a young offender.&nbsp; He pleaded guilty to second degree murder and was sentenced as a youth.&nbsp; As part of his plea agreement, D.S. signed the ASF drafted by Crown counsel, with input from defence counsel.&nbsp; In it, D.S. directly implicated the appellant in the murder: &nbsp;the appellant gave D.S. the handgun that was used in the shooting; he ordered D.S. to shoot the victim; and he demanded the return of the handgun after the shooting.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of his plea, D.S. acknowledged the accuracy of the ASF.&nbsp; At the appellant’s trial, he testified that he did not understand the words “acknowledged” or “accurate” as used by his counsel at the guilty plea proceedings.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ASF was neither videotaped nor preceded by sworn oath or affirmation.&nbsp; D.S. was told that, for endorsing the agreed statement, no further statement regarding the murder would be required from him.&nbsp; During his testimony at the appellant’s trial, he said that was one of the reasons that motivated him to plead guilty.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During examination-in-chief, the Crown asked D.S. to adopt the ASF.&nbsp; D.S. testified that he could not remember signing the document, but acknowledged that it bore his signature.&nbsp; D.S. further denied the facts in the statement implicating the appellant.&nbsp; Instead, D.S. testified that the gun was his own; he shot the victim because of the way he was talking; and he threw the gun into the river after the shooting.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to D.S.’s denials, the Crown sought to adduce the ASF for the truth of its contents.&nbsp; The trial judge rejected the Crown’s application.&nbsp; At the close of the Crown’s case, the trial judge granted the defence’s application for a directed order acquitting the appellant.</p> 
   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Decisions Below</u></p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a <i>voir dire</i>, Flynn J. ruled that the signed ASF — hearsay evidence by virtue of being an out-of-court statement adduced for the truth of its contents — did not meet the threshold reliability required for it to be admissible as evidence.&nbsp; None of the safeguards identified in this Court’s decision in <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740 (<i>K.G.B.</i>), for reducing the dangers associated with hearsay had been undertaken.&nbsp; The statement was not videotaped; there had been no recital of an oath or affirmation; and the transcript of the guilty plea proceedings was not a suitable substitute to assess D.S.’s demeanour and credibility at the time the statement was made.&nbsp; Furthermore, the statement had been drafted by counsel; it was not offered spontaneously and was not in D.S.’s own words.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Referring to <i>R. v. Conway</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 579 (C.A.), Flynn J. noted that the opportunity for an effective cross-examination at trial would be “to a large extent illusory” where the declarant experiences significant memory lapses or where he recants (A.R., vol. I, at p. 61).&nbsp; D.S.’s refusal to waive solicitor-client privilege precluded questions to D.S. or his counsel about how D.S. came to implicate the appellant (A.R., vol. I, at p. 59).</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Flynn J. found insufficient means for the jury to assess the reliability of the ASF as a prior inconsistent statement and held that it was not admissible as evidence for the truth of its contents.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in his understanding of the scope of solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; Solicitor-client privilege would not have precluded all questioning of D.S. or his counsel regarding the ASF or his choice to implicate the appellant.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal also held that the trial judge further erred in strictly focussing on the<i> K.G.B.</i> requirements for establishing reliability and in failing to consider other factors, such as the solemnity of the occasion upon which D.S. adopted the ASF and the involvement of counsel in preparing it.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Satisfied that without such errors the trial judge might have admitted the ASF into evidence, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal, and ordered a new trial.</p>

Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 2.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law has conventionally favoured the evidence of witnesses who give evidence in court because they can be observed, under oath or affirmation, and their<b> </b>credibility and reliability can be tested by cross-examination.&nbsp; These elements help the trier of fact assess the credibility of the declarant or witness, the reliability of the evidence, and the degree of probative force it carries.&nbsp; When these elements are absent, as is the case with a statement made outside of the court, it is more difficult for the trier of fact to make these assessments.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over time, however, the law has recognized that in certain circumstances, it may be safe to rely on out-of-court statements for the truth of their contents.&nbsp; Exceptions to the hearsay rule developed for statements carrying certain guarantees of inherent trustworthiness, often because of the circumstances in which they were made (for example, dying declarations and declarations that are adverse in interest).</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the traditional exceptions, however, this Court developed a principled approach that permits trial judges to admit hearsay evidence if it meets the twin threshold requirements of necessity and reliability.&nbsp; This is a flexible case-by-case examination. &nbsp;See especially <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; <i>K.G.B.</i>; <i>R. v. U. (F.J.)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764; and <i>R. v. Blackman</i>, 2008 SCC 37, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 298, at para. 38. &nbsp;With the increased flexibility provided by the principled approach, however, the gatekeeper function of the trial judge becomes more complex and nuanced.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where a witness recants from a prior statement, necessity is established: <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 78.&nbsp; The focus in this case is on whether the prior inconsistent statement meets threshold reliability.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, as the evidentiary gatekeeper, assesses the <i>threshold</i> reliability of the hearsay statement.&nbsp; The decision as to the <i>ultimate</i> reliability of the statement is left to the trier of fact:&nbsp; <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 2. Even if the necessity and reliability of the hearsay evidence are proven, the trial judge maintains discretion to exclude the evidence where the “prejudicial effect is out of proportion to its probative value”:&nbsp; <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 3.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why not simply let the trier of fact determine both threshold and ultimate reliability?&nbsp; Professors D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser provide the following explanation, with which I agree:</p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">In considering “reliability”, a distinction is made between “threshold” and “ultimate” reliability.&nbsp; This distinction reflects the important difference between admission and reliance.&nbsp; Threshold reliability is for the trial judge and concerns the admissibility of the statement.&nbsp; The trial judge acts as a gatekeeper whose function “is limited to determining whether the particular hearsay statement exhibits sufficient <i>indicia</i> of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement.”&nbsp; So long as it can be assessed and accepted by a reasonable trier of fact, then the evidence should be admitted.&nbsp; Once admitted, the jury remains the ultimate arbiter of what to do with the evidence and deciding whether or not the statement is true.</p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Historically, an out-of-court prior inconsistent statement of a non-accused witness was admissible only to impeach the credibility of the witness.&nbsp; A prior inconsistent statement — hearsay evidence — was not admissible for the truth of its contents unless the witness adopted the prior statement in court.&nbsp; Otherwise, the jury was limited to rejecting the <i>viva voce</i> evidence of the recanting witness; the jury could not substitute the contents of the out-of-court statement.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This traditional rule excluding prior inconsistent statements was altered in <i>K.G.B.</i> to conform with the evolving principled approach to hearsay.&nbsp; On an exceptional basis, a prior inconsistent statement is admissible for the truth of its contents, provided the threshold criteria of necessity and reliability are established.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>K.G.B.</i>, at p. 787, Lamer C.J. stated that the focus of the reliability inquiry, when dealing with prior inconsistent statements, “is on the comparative reliability of the prior statement and the testimony offered at trial, and so additional indicia and guarantees of reliability . . . must be secured in order to bring the prior statement to a comparable standard of reliability before such statements are admitted as substantive evidence”.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Lamer C.J. held, at pp. 795-96, that a prior inconsistent statement of a non-accused witness may be admitted for the truth of its contents if the so-called <i>K.G.B.</i> reliability indicia are met:&nbsp; (1) the statement is made under oath or solemn affirmation after a warning as to possible sanctions if the person is untruthful; (2) the statement is videotaped or recorded in its entirety; and (3) the opposing party has a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness on the statement.&nbsp; Such <i>K.G.B.</i> statements have become prevalent, especially in murder investigations.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the <i>K.G.B.</i> indicia are not the only means of establishing threshold reliability.&nbsp; The prior inconsistent statement’s threshold reliability may be established by:&nbsp; (1) the presence of adequate substitutes for testing truth and accuracy (procedural reliability); and (2) sufficient circumstantial guarantees of reliability or an inherent trustworthiness (substantive reliability):&nbsp; <i>Khelawon</i>, at paras. 61-63. These two principal ways of showing threshold reliability are not mutually exclusive:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Devine</i>, 2008 SCC 36, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 283, at para. 22.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admissibility of hearsay evidence, such as the prior inconsistent statement in this case, is a question of law.&nbsp; Of course, the factual findings that go into that determination are entitled to deference and are not challenged in this case.&nbsp; As well, a trial judge is well placed to assess the hearsay dangers in a particular case and the effectiveness of any safeguards to assist in overcoming them.&nbsp; Thus, absent an error in principle, the trial judge’s determination of threshold reliability is entitled to deference:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Couture</i>, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at para. 81.</p>

Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14.&nbsp; The Crown is not required to establish “that the verdict would necessarily have been different”:&nbsp; <i>Graveline</i>, at para. 14.&nbsp; This is still, however, a “heavy onus” for the Crown:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Briscoe</i>, 2010 SCC 13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 26.</p>

   <p class="Citation-AltC">Solicitor/client privilege precluded questions to or from [D.S.] or indeed of his counsel about how it came to be that this confession from [D.S.] as the shooter and his implication of the accused as the person who provided him with the gun and directed him to do the shooting was made on the day of his guilty plea almost two years after his arrest when he had never confessed or implicated Yousanthan Youvarajah in all that time.

(3d) 401, at para. 93).&nbsp; Further, at para. 95, the Court of Appeal cited the trial judge’s statement that “no legal witnesses that have [ever] spoken to [D.S.]” should be called (A.R., vol.

   <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">It is important to note that the availability of the declarant to be cross-examined will not necessarily tip the scales in favour of admissibility.&nbsp; In order for this factor to weigh in favour of admission, there must be a “full opportunity to cross-examine the witness” at trial (<i>K.G.B.</i>, at p. 796).

In these circumstances, there was motivation to shift responsibility to his co-accused.&nbsp; D.S. was also assured that he would not have to make any further statements to police and he testified at the appellant’s trial that this was one of the reasons that he had accepted the plea agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; D.S. further testified that he agreed to some facts in the ASF that he said he did not or could not know and that he did not understand everything that he read before agreeing to the statement’s contents.&nbsp; Those portions of the ASF that shifted responsibility for the murder to the appellant are inherently unreliable.</p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge also noted that the ASF lacked additional indicia of reliability beyond the three markers laid out in <i>B. (K.G.)</i>.&nbsp; Namely, the ASF was not spontaneous, it was not crafted in D.S.’s own words, and the circumstances of the ASF allowed the court to infer a motive to lie in order to secure a lesser sentence as part of the guilty plea.&nbsp; The trial judge further noted that D.S. was never warned of the potential penal consequences of later recanting.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed the decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal where the acquittal was set aside and a new trial ordered.&nbsp; In her reasons, Simmons J.A. addressed three issues.&nbsp; First, she held that the trial judge erred in finding that the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. was illusory.&nbsp; Specifically, Simmons J.A. found that the trial judge “put his stamp of approval” on the position of both defence and Crown counsel that a cross-examination of D.S. or D.S.’s counsel about the circumstances giving rise to the ASF was precluded due to D.S.’s assertion of privilege (2011 ONCA 654, 107 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 95).&nbsp; Simmons J.A. also distinguished the instant case from <i>R. v. Conway</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 579, where the Ontario Court of Appeal found the possibility of cross-examining a recanting witness to be illusory since he could not recall the prior statement.&nbsp; Simmons J.A. found that D.S. could recall portions of the ASF and, in fact, the three elements crucial to the Crown’s case against Youvarajah.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Simmons J.A. found that the trial judge erred by unduly focusing on the <i>B. (K.G.)</i> recommended safeguards while failing to consider other factors relevant to the reliability analysis.&nbsp; She found that the lack of “presence” at the time of the prior statement, such as in the form of a video, was irrelevant due to D.S.’s minimal involvement in the proceeding and that the solemn circumstances of D.S.’s guilty plea added to the reliability of the statement.&nbsp; Simmons J.A. also held that it could be inferred that D.S. was warned about the penal consequences of recanting since experienced defence counsel was involved in the preparation and presentation of the ASF.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Simmons J.A. briefly addressed the issue of inherent motive for D.S. to lie in the ASF.&nbsp; She found that this was an issue for the trial judge to address at the new trial if the other indicia considered were not sufficient to meet the standard of threshold reliability.</p>

   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Overview of Admissibility of Prior Inconsistent Statements Under the Principled Approach</i></p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principled approach to the admissibility of hearsay evidence was adopted by this Court in <i>B. (K.G.)</i>. Prior to <i>B. (K.G.)</i>, the use of prior inconsistent statements, or any form of hearsay evidence, was restricted to impeaching witness credibility.&nbsp; This restriction was to ensure that untested and unreliable evidence that could lead to an unfair verdict was excluded and that litigants were provided with the opportunity to confront witnesses who were adverse to their position.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In certain circumstances, hearsay evidence presents minimal dangers to trial fairness.&nbsp; In those situations, its exclusion would be more detrimental to the fact-finding function of the court than its admission.&nbsp; By endorsing the principled approach in <i>B. (K.G.)</i>, this Court sought to strike a better balance between trial fairness and the truth-seeking function of the judicial process.&nbsp; Under the principled approach, hearsay statements remain presumptively inadmissible, but may be admitted where necessity and reliability are sufficiently demonstrated.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[92]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Necessity arises from the fact that important evidence leading to the truth would otherwise be lost when a witness recants.&nbsp; This aspect of the principled approach requires no further analysis on these facts.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[93]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reliability requirement is aimed at identifying cases where the dangers of hearsay evidence may be overcome.&nbsp; Indeed, in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at paras. 62-63, Charron J. indicated that the reliability requirement will generally be met either (1) by showing that there is no real concern about a statement’s truth owing to the circumstances in which it arose; or (2) by showing that there is no real danger that the statement is made in hearsay form since, in the circumstances, its reliability can be sufficiently tested by means other than contemporaneous cross-examination and presence.&nbsp; These categories are not mutually exclusive and merely provide guidance in identifying the factors to be considered in an admissibility inquiry.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[94]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>B. (K.G.)</i>, this Court addressed the presence of adequate substitutes for traditional safeguards relied upon to test hearsay evidence. The admissibility question in <i>B. (K.G.) </i>dealt with the prior inconsistent statements made by the accused’s friends in which they told police that he was responsible for stabbing and killing the victim.&nbsp; The three friends recanted at trial and the Crown sought to have their prior statements admitted for their truth.&nbsp; While a new trial was ordered to determine the admissibility of the prior inconsistent statements, this Court outlined the principled approach to be used in the analysis.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[95]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lamer C.J. indicated that sufficient circumstantial guarantees of reliability could be found where three indicia were satisfied: if (1) the statement was made under oath, solemn affirmation or solemn declaration following an explicit warning as to the criminal consequences of making false statements; (2) the entire statement was videotaped; and (3) the opposing party has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, Lamer C.J. left the door open for alternative indicia of reliability, stating, at p. 796:</p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltC">Alternatively, other circumstantial guarantees of reliability may suffice to render such statements substantively admissible, provided that the judge is satisfied that the circumstances provide adequate assurances of reliability in place of those which the hearsay rule traditionally requires.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[97]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, subsequent cases have found hearsay evidence to be admissible even when all three of the indicia from <i>B. (K.G.)</i> are not present.&nbsp; <i>R. v. U. (F.J.)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764, was such a case.&nbsp; In that case, the accused was arrested for reported sexual activity with his 13-year-old daughter.&nbsp; During separate police interviews, both the accused and his daughter provided matching and specific details of the same sexual activities and occurrences, including having had intercourse the previous night.&nbsp; The issue on appeal was whether the trial judge erred in allowing the jury to compare the accused’s unadopted statement with his daughter’s unadopted prior inconsistent statement.&nbsp; Despite the absence of an oath and videotaped statement, this Court found that the reliability threshold was met.&nbsp; In addition to the ability to cross-examine the accused, the Court found reliability in the “strikingly similar” statements provided by the accused and his daughter.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[98]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Khelawon</i>, this Court further clarified that <i>B. (K.G.)</i> was never intended to create categorical exceptions.&nbsp; Rather, admissibility was to be determined using the principled approach on a case-by-case basis, allowing the indicia of oath, presence (or video), and cross-examination to provide guidance in the reliability assessment as opposed to rigid requirements.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[99]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless of the circumstances of a particular case and the indicia that may be available for the reliability analysis, it is crucial not to lose sight of the truth-seeking function of an admissibility inquiry under the principled approach.&nbsp; In the instance of a prior inconsistent statement, the purpose of the admissibility inquiry is not to make an absolute determination of the reliability of the hearsay statement as compared with the subsequent testimony.&nbsp; Rather, the inquiry is intended to ensure that the statement is sufficiently reliable in order for the trier of fact to assign the appropriate weight to the evidence. As Charron J. states in <i>Khelawon</i>, the “general exclusionary rule is a recognition of the difficulty for a trier of fact to assess what weight, if any, is to be given to a statement made by a person who has not been seen or heard, and who has not been subject to the test of cross-examination” (para. 35).</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[100]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This principle is articulated in <i>B. (K.G.)</i> where this Court draws the distinction between threshold reliability and ultimate reliability, stating:</p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltC">The ultimate reliability of the statement and the weight to be attached to it remain, as with all evidence, determinations for the trier of fact.&nbsp; What the reliability component of the principled approach to hearsay exceptions addresses is a threshold of reliability, rather than ultimate or certain reliability. [p. 787]</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[101]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Charron J. stresses in <i>Khelawon</i>, at paras. 92-93, this distinction does not mean that relevant factors should be categorized in terms of threshold and ultimate reliability.&nbsp; Rather, a more functional approach should be adopted by which the context will determine whether certain factors go to threshold reliability.&nbsp; The focus of the inquiry should be on the dangers of hearsay evidence and the circumstances relied upon to overcome those dangers.&nbsp; However, “it is crucial to the integrity of the fact-finding process that the question of ultimate reliability not be pre-determined on the admissibility <i>voir dire</i>” (para. 93).</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[102]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the truth-seeking function of the judicial process, I am of the view that threshold reliability should be generously interpreted in the admissibility inquiry.&nbsp; Trial fairness and protection against the dangers of hearsay are not sacrificed where the trier of fact is ultimately able to make reasonable determinations of the weight to be accorded to evidence before the court.&nbsp; The reliability inquiry does not need to ensure absolute reliability.&nbsp; Rather, the circumstances surrounding the hearsay evidence must provide a sufficient basis for the trier of fact to assess and assign the appropriate weight and eventually determine ultimate reliability.</p> 
   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Application to the Case at Hand</i></p>

Rather, the admissibility inquiry was incomplete and did not provide a proper basis for the trial judge to exclude the relevant evidence.&nbsp; As articulated by the Ontario Court of Appeal, the issue of admissibility should be addressed at a new trial where threshold reliability can be properly assessed.</p> 
   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-85.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b><u>The Nature of the Hearsay Evidence in Question</u></p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much of the jurisprudence pertaining to the admission of prior inconsistent statements deals with statements made to police (see <i>Khelawon</i>; <i>B.&nbsp;(K.G.)</i>; <i>U. (F.J.)</i>; <i>R. v. Couture</i>, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517; <i>R. v. Trieu</i> (2005), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 373 (Ont. C.A.)) and to a lesser degree with out-of-court conversations (see <i>R. v. Blackman</i>, 2008 SCC 37, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 298) or statements made at preliminary hearings for the trial where admissibility is in question (see <i>R. v. Hawkins</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043).&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hearsay statement at issue in this case is an ASF which was drafted with the contribution and approval of Crown counsel, defence counsel and the accused.&nbsp; More importantly, it was accepted by a court in the sentencing of a youth for the very serious crime of second degree murder. While the ASF and guilty plea proceedings did not include an explicit indication by the Crown that it consented to a lesser charge against D.S. because of his anticipated subsequent cooperation in proceedings against Youvarajah, it is certainly implicit in the nature of the plea agreement and the facts therein.&nbsp; Accordingly, the ASF was used in some capacity to reduce the sentence of D.S. for a very serious crime.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The characteristics of the ASF in this case are somewhat unique when compared to other statements in previous case law. Statements to police and out-of-court conversations are not generally admitted as evidence in proceedings that may limit another individual’s freedom through sentencing, or that impact on society’s interest in deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution, not to mention public protection from dangerous offenders. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An ASF presented in court carries an inherent level of reliability that the judicial system accepts and, in fact, implicitly relies upon in the workings of the administration of justice.&nbsp; It follows that not allowing an ASF to be admitted for its truth in a subsequent hearing, to be weighed and evaluated by the trier of fact, is problematic when viewed through the wider lens of the repute of the system of administration of justice.&nbsp; What does it say about the administration of justice if the courts accept the reliability of a statement to convict an individual and to vary the length of his sentence for a crime as serious as murder, but are unwilling to place that same statement before the trier of fact in another proceeding to be weighed and considered against a recantation of that statement?</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, if a statement is accepted for its truth by the courts, and used to balance the liberty interests of the accused with societal considerations such as deterrence and retribution, then that statement provides a level of implicit reliability that warrants consideration in the admissibility inquiry in a subsequent third-party trial.&nbsp; That is not to say that a statement’s use and judicial acceptance at a prior proceeding is sufficient in and of itself to meet the reliability requirement of the principled approach.&nbsp; Rather, it is merely a factor that must be considered in the admissibility inquiry, a factor that goes towards meeting the threshold reliability standard.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certainly, there are potential dangers that could arise with the use of such statements at subsequent trials.&nbsp; Indeed, these concerns are captured in a line of Ontario cases that has suggested that care should be taken when considering the admissibility of a statement for its truth under the principled approach when it is read in at a witness’s earlier guilty plea (see <i>R. v. Tran</i>, 2010 ONCA 471, 103 O.R. (3d) 131; <i>R. v. D.P.</i>, 2010 ONCA 563, 268 O.A.C. 118; and <i>R. v. McGee</i>, 2009 CanLII 60789 (Ont. S.C.J.)).&nbsp; There is a whole host of reasons for which an accused could provide untruthful information in the context of a guilty plea, including a reduced sentence, expediency of multiple proceedings, retribution against the target of a subsequent trial through cooperative testimony, or even the lack of understanding of the meaning of the statement or of the charges laid against the individual.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, these potential dangers do not apply in every case and the resulting blanket assertions of unreliability do not take account of the nuanced approach that should take stock of factors that may add to or detract from the reliability inquiry in the particular context of the statement in question.&nbsp; While these cases correctly highlight some of the reliability concerns with this type of statement, they do not address some of the potential indicia of reliability that may be found in certain circumstances.&nbsp; It requires little imagination to envision circumstances where making a statement against friends, family, or professional acquaintances could be socially or even physically detrimental to a recanting witness. These social or physical ramifications against the interests of the witness provide an indication of reliability that may be weighed against any motive to lie. But these are considerations that must be borne out by the evidence and by the unique circumstances of each case and may not even be necessary to explore in depth at this stage of the analysis.&nbsp; Certainly, motive need not be considered if reliability can be established by other means.&nbsp; Nevertheless, motive is something that can provide context to the threshold reliability analysis. <b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[112]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;I also do not accept the argument that only the essential elements of the crime detailed in the ASF are accepted for their truth by the courts in a guilty plea.&nbsp; The implication of this proposition is that the courts are willing to accept a statement that is only partially true so long as it provides the judiciary with the necessary elements to convict an individual. Beyond the obvious concerns of threatening individuals’ liberty or reducing sentencing based on documents that are deemed to be at least partially unreliable or untrue, this creates an arbitrary distinction about which aspects of a guilty plea are accepted for their truth.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[113]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certainly an argument could be made that the reliability of a guilty plea rests on the admission against the interests of the accused. However, as I have stated above, what constitutes a statement against the interests of the accused may vary from case to case depending on the circumstances.&nbsp; Indeed, an individual may place his safety or even his life in jeopardy by implicating himself in a serious crime.&nbsp; This factor should be considered on the circumstances of each case.&nbsp; A rigid rule finding that all third-party guilty pleas are unreliable is potentially detrimental to the truth-finding function of the judicial process.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[114]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, accepting that only the essential elements of a guilty plea need to be accepted for their truth ignores the interrelated nature of a guilty plea and sentencing.&nbsp; Factors that do not form part of the essential elements of a crime may nonetheless prove to be pertinent when considering mitigating or aggravating factors in sentencing.&nbsp; This is particularly true where the trial judge is presented with a joint submission by the Crown and the accused concerning sentencing and must determine whether the recommendation is appropriate within the entire context of the crime in question.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[115]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looking at the case before this Court, the three crucial facts from the ASF which the Crown relies on are certainly not essential elements of D.S.’s crime.&nbsp; The source of the gun, D.S.’s reasons for shooting Freake, and the manner in which the gun was disposed of do not form part of the <i>actus reus </i>or <i>mens rea</i> relating to D.S.’s crime.&nbsp; Nonetheless, these factors are relevant to motive and the degree of planning and deliberation, all of which are properly considered during sentencing. Allowing a judge to consider these factors in sentencing, while finding that they are not sufficiently reliable to even be weighed by the trier of fact in another case, allows for an inconsistent application of the reliability of evidence and brings the administration of justice into question.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[116]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, when dealing with threshold reliability, the fact that courts accept the statements read in on a guilty plea when considering convictions and sentencing is a factor that points to the reliability of the prior inconsistent statement, even when such statement implicates a third party.&nbsp; It would not be prudent to make blanket conclusions about the dangers associated with this sort of statement, nor about its inherent reliability.&nbsp; Each case will have to be examined on its particular circumstances when determining threshold reliability, but consideration should certainly be given to the general acceptance of and reliance on statements read in as part of a guilty plea. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[117]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the nature of the statement in question warrants consideration, it is still necessary in the instant case to determine whether the ASF meets the requirements of necessity and reliability under the principled approach.&nbsp; Since necessity is not at issue, the balance of my analysis will explore whether the threshold of reliability is met.</p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[118]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essential question before this Court is whether the trial judge erred in finding that the ASF was not sufficiently reliable to be admitted for its truth.&nbsp; For the reasons that follow, I agree with the conclusion of the Ontario Court of Appeal that the trial judge failed to adequately assess the available indicia of reliability and erroneously found the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. to be illusory.&nbsp; While the ASF may in fact prove to be too unreliable to be admitted, the trial judge’s analysis was insufficient to permit him to come to that conclusion.&nbsp; As highlighted by Charron J. in <i>Khelawon</i>, the most important contextual factor in the reliability inquiry is the availability of the declarant for cross-examination.&nbsp; Accordingly, my analysis will begin there.</p> 
   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cross-Examination</i></p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[119]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The opportunity to cross-examine the declarant in relation to his prior inconsistent statement warrants strong consideration in a reliability analysis.&nbsp; While the concerns of hearsay evidence still exist even where the declarant is available at trial, cross-examination can go a long way towards alleviating those concerns.&nbsp; As Lamer C.J. noted in <i>B. (K.G.)</i>, “the focus of the inquiry in the case of prior inconsistent statements is on the comparative reliability of the prior statement and the testimony offered at trial” (p. 787).&nbsp; The availability of cross-examination allows the opposing party to test the current version and simultaneously address the declarant’s initial statement.&nbsp; As Charron J. states in <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 41:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, although the underlying rationale for the general exclusionary rule may not be as obvious when the declarant is available to testify, it is the same — the difficulty of testing the reliability of the out-of-court statement.&nbsp; The difficulty of assessing W’s out-of-court statement is the reason why it falls within the definition of hearsay and is subject to the general exclusionary rule.&nbsp; <u>As one may readily appreciate, however, the degree of difficulty may be substantially alleviated in cases where the declarant is available for cross-examination on the earlier statement, particularly where an accurate record of the statement can be tendered in evidence.</u>&nbsp; I will come back to that point later.&nbsp; My point here is simply to explain why, by definition, hearsay extends to out-of-court statements tendered for their truth even when the declarant is before the court.

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[121]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first error committed by the trial judge was to overextend the breadth of solicitor-client privilege and its impact on the ability to cross-examine D.S.&nbsp; The trial judge found that solicitor-client privilege precluded questioning D.S. and his former counsel about the circumstances of the guilty plea, the drafting of the ASF, and D.S.’s implication of Youvarajah as the person who provided him the gun and directed him to do the shooting.&nbsp; While I am loath to provide a road map for the Crown to follow at a new trial, the Ontario Court of Appeal was correct in finding that the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. was not entirely closed and that the trial judge misapprehended the scope and impact of solicitor-client privilege on the opportunity for cross-examination.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[122]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Solicitor-client privilege is intended to prohibit the disclosure of any form of communication made in confidence between a lawyer and his client for the legitimate purpose of obtaining lawful professional advice or assistance, unless the privilege is waived by the client or a recognized exception to the privilege applies.&nbsp; This definition is captured succinctly by J. H. Wigmore in <i>Evidence in Trials at Common Law</i> (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8, at p. 554, and adopted by this Court in <i>R. v. McClure</i>, 2001 SCC 14, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445, at para. 36:</p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[125]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown elicited evidence from D.S. regarding his understanding of the ASF.&nbsp; Specifically, D.S. acknowledged that at his guilty plea he agreed that “Yousanthan Youvarajah gave [D.S.] a loaded small black handgun” and that he understood what that meant.&nbsp; Further, the Crown read the following statement to D.S. from the ASF:&nbsp; “When he was given the gun, [D.S.] was told by Yousanthan Youvarajah to shoot Mr. Freake sometime during the course of the drug rip off” (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 62-63). During the Crown’s cross-examination, D.S. admitted that he remembered the statement being read at his guilty plea and that he agreed to those facts through his counsel. </p>

III, at p. 92).&nbsp; Defence counsel was also able to elicit D.S.’s assertions that he had never implicated Youvarajah in the killing until his guilty plea on September 17, 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[128]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant claims that any cross-examination on the six aforementioned areas would either skirt the critical issues or be entirely blocked by solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; I cannot agree with this position.&nbsp; The appellant’s position presupposes that D.S.’s recantation arose from direct or indirect communications with counsel.&nbsp; While this is certainly possible, and maybe even likely, an admissibility inquiry should not rest on assumptions. &nbsp;Further, and as I have already alluded to, limits on cross-examination should not be applied rigidly and absolutely where solicitor-client privilege is asserted.&nbsp; Rather, issues of privilege should be addressed as they arise on cross-examination.&nbsp; This way, relevant information that may not be prohibited by the assertion of privilege may still be elicited, furthering the underlying truth-seeking function of the proceedings.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[129]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the issue is not before this Court, it bears mentioning that this approach is not an invitation for counsel to attempt to skirt privilege by inducing the waiver of privilege by an unsuspecting witness who has clearly asserted solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; Solicitor-client privilege is a fundamental principle of the Canadian legal system.&nbsp; Any conduct that unscrupulously attempts to erode solicitor-client privilege should not be encouraged.&nbsp; While solicitor-client privilege is not absolute and circumstances may arise where it will be subordinated, duping a witness into waiving privilege is never an acceptable practice. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[130]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that there were several subjects about which D.S. could have been cross-examined and that this could have potentially assisted in establishing reliability, the trial judge erred in determining that cross-examination was effectively foreclosed by the claim of solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[131]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the mistaken view of the scope of solicitor-client privilege rested solely on the shoulders of Crown counsel and that the trial judge cannot be held accountable for the tactical decisions made by counsel.&nbsp; I cannot agree with this argument, given the facts before this Court.&nbsp; Crown counsel certainly misunderstood the implications of D.S.’s asserted privilege, but the transcripts provide clear indication that the mistake was shared.&nbsp; Indeed, defence counsel was the first to state that any cross-examination was meaningfully foreclosed once D.S. asserted privilege, a position that, coincidentally or not, was advantageous to the accused’s case.&nbsp; Crown counsel seemingly concurred by indicating that he did not anticipate calling further witnesses after the privilege was asserted.&nbsp; The trial judge did not correct these erroneous assumptions.&nbsp; Rather, as Simmons J.A. correctly notes, “the trial judge put his stamp of approval on this approach — and effectively prevented the Crown from reconsidering calling D.S.’s counsel” (para. 95).&nbsp; This is evident from the following exchange:</p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">[CROWN COUNSEL]:&nbsp; And I don’t anticipate even now given the comments of Mr. Marentette I don’t anticipate needing to call further witnesses.</p>

III, at p. 1).&nbsp; Perhaps most telling was the following excerpt from the trial judge’s reasons where he summarized the impact of solicitor-client privilege without having heard any argument on the matter:</p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltC">Solicitor/client privilege precluded questions to or from [D.S.] or indeed of his counsel about how it came to be that this confession from [D.S.] as the shooter and his implication of the accused as the person who provided him with the gun and directed him to do the shooting was made on the day of his guilty plea almost two years after his arrest when he had never confessed or implicated Yousanthan Youvarajah in all that time.

S.G.T.</i>, 2010 SCC 20, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 36).&nbsp; However, it cannot be said that the trial judge in the present case remained impartial by weighing in with a clear expression of prohibition.&nbsp; The appellant’s argument would be more compelling had the trial judge remained silent on the matter and merely allowed Crown counsel to proceed, but this was clearly not the case.&nbsp; At the very least, the trial judge’s remarks improperly influenced the conduct of counsel.</p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[135]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Conway</i>, two men were charged with the second degree murder of an elderly disabled man while committing a robbery.&nbsp; They pleaded not guilty to murder charges but guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds that they did not have the requisite <i>mens rea</i>, having ingested intoxicating substances prior to committing the offence.&nbsp; One witness provided a written statement to the police denying knowledge of the killing and provided a subsequent written statement implicating the accused.&nbsp; This statement had none of the indicia of reliability outlined in <i>B. (K.G.)</i>.&nbsp; At trial, the witness could not recall providing either written statement to police.&nbsp; In finding the second written statement inadmissible for its truth, Labrosse J.A. found that the opportunity to cross-examine a witness who recanted and denied all recollection of the prior inconsistent statement was illusory.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[136]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The important distinction to be made between that matter and the present one is that two versions of the witness’s story could not be said to be before the trier of fact.&nbsp; The evidence given by the witness amounted to a declaration of “I don’t remember” (p. 589).&nbsp; As Labrosse J.A. stresses, the value of cross-examining a recanting witness lies in assessing the comparative reliability of the two versions.&nbsp; Where both versions cannot be tested by the trier of fact, this cannot be accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[137]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the potential cross-examination of D.S. as to his statements does not suffer from the same deficiency as that encountered in <i>Conway</i>.&nbsp; Simmons J.A. correctly states that while D.S. initially claimed not to recall signing the ASF, he later confirmed that he remembered a number of events set out within the document.&nbsp; Indeed, Simmons J.A. astutely points out, at para. 74, that the trial judge acknowledged this very fact when he stated:&nbsp; “When cross-examined by the Crown, [D.S.] admitted making many of the statements in the [ASF] and conceded that many of those statements were true” (A.R., vol.

(K.G.)</i>.&nbsp; In fact, as stated by Lamer C.J. in <i>B. (K.G.)</i> itself, “other circumstantial guarantees of reliability may suffice to render such statements substantively admissible” (p. 796).&nbsp; This was clearly understood by the Ontario Court of Appeal in this case where Simmons J.A. stated that “the focus of the threshold reliability inquiry can change depending on the circumstances of the case” (para. 123). I also agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal’s finding that other factors were available in this case that could have satisfied the trial judge that the circumstances surrounding the drafting and reading in of the ASF provided assurances of reliability equivalent to an oath and presence, in the form of video.&nbsp; If these indicia had been considered and cross-examination had been permitted, it is possible that threshold reliability would have been met.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[141]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, perhaps the most persuasive indicia of reliability are the nature of the statement and how it was constructed.&nbsp; As quoted above, in <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 41, Charron J. indicated that where the declarant is available for cross-examination, an accurate record of the statement can do much to alleviate the dangers of hearsay.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[142]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ASF tendered as evidence in D.S.’s guilty plea proceeding provides just such a record.&nbsp; Having been reduced to writing, signed not only by D.S. but by both Crown and defence counsel, and having been read in to the record in the context of D.S.’s guilty plea, the source of the document cannot be disputed.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[143]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of how the ASF was constructed further supports its reliability.&nbsp; This was not a statement that was unilaterally drafted and forced upon D.S. to adopt.&nbsp; Rather, the drafting of the ASF was a collaborative effort where there is evidence that at least one crucial component to the Crown’s case against Youvarajah was supplied by defence counsel — namely the statement that Youvarajah supplied D.S. with the gun.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[144]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, D.S. had the opportunity to review the ASF with his counsel prior to signing it and adopting it.&nbsp; This is an important aspect as it refutes any negative inferences that could be drawn against the ASF on the grounds that it was not captured in D.S.’s own words or that D.S. did not understand its contents.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[145]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant correctly argues that a lawyer’s ethical obligation not to knowingly present false statements to the court does not ensure the truth of the contents of the ASF.&nbsp; However, it does provide some assurances that D.S. was advised of the consequences of providing a false statement.&nbsp; Before entering a guilty plea, counsel has an ethical obligation under rules of professional conduct to ensure that the client (1) is voluntarily admitting the elements of the offence; and (2) understands the implications and possible consequences of a guilty plea, particularly with regards to the authority and discretion of the court.&nbsp; In the absence of evidence to the contrary in the instant case, it is not unreasonable to assume that counsel would have advised D.S. about the contents of the ASF, the potential consequences of implicating the appellant, and the potential penal consequences of subsequently recanting.&nbsp; This assumption is also supported on the record by D.S.’s admission that he understood that the basis of his guilty plea was the ASF.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[146]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps most importantly, D.S. testified that he understood the three crucial components of the ASF, namely that the appellant gave D.S. the gun, told him to shoot Freake, and demanded that D.S. return the gun.&nbsp; Without more persuasive evidence to the contrary, this essentially forecloses any argument that D.S. lacked understanding of the ASF’s contents.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[147]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looking beyond the construction of the ASF, the context of the proceedings under which it was read in to court and the contents of the ASF itself provide additional indicia supporting threshold reliability.&nbsp; As the Ontario Court of Appeal stated, “the solemnity of the occasion on which the [ASF] was presented” was a feature that favoured threshold reliability (para. 137).&nbsp; It certainly would have been ideal for the ASF to have been adopted under oath or solemn affirmation, but the nature of the guilty plea can help fill that gap when considered with the other indicia of reliability before the court.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[148]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Court of Appeal also correctly rejected the trial judge’s assertion that the lack of spontaneity of the statement and the fact that it was not in D.S.’s own words detracted from the reliability of the ASF.&nbsp; While spontaneity can be an indication of reliability, its absence does not necessarily detract from it.&nbsp; With regards to an ASF prepared in the context of a guilty plea, reliability is not found through spontaneity but through the carefully crafted language which is subsequently adopted by the declarant after careful consideration with his counsel. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[149]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that the lack of “presence” when the ASF was read in at the guilty plea, for example by way of video, was of no consequence since D.S.’s only contribution was to reply “yes” in response to two separate questions by counsel (para. 128).&nbsp; I respectfully disagree with this assessment.&nbsp; It is not appropriate to dismiss presence as indicia of reliability merely because of the declarant’s limited level of involvement or because of the brevity of his statement.&nbsp; Had there been video presence, D.S.’s demeanour could have been assessed throughout the reading in of the ASF as well as in his answers to the two questions posed to him.&nbsp; Even if one were to focus solely on D.S.’s two short responses, such presence could provide invaluable insight into D.S.’s demeanour and ultimately into the veracity of the statement.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[150]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I cannot agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal’s assessment on the issue of presence, I do not think that lack of presence is detrimental to potentially establishing reliability.&nbsp; If the cross-examination is found sufficiently meaningful and other indicia support the reliability of the ASF, presence may be superfluous.&nbsp; As I have detailed above, the reliability indicia from <i>B. (K.G.) </i>are not rigid and the absence of one factor can be overcome if other factors are sufficient in establishing threshold reliability.&nbsp; It is not necessary for me to draw any firm conclusion in this regard in the instant matter, and this is a question best left for a new trial where all of the factors can be assessed in concert. </p> 
   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Conclusion</u></p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[151]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there are certainly concerns with admitting evidence from a guilty plea proceeding at the trial of a third party, I find it unpalatable to apply a blanket prohibition at the admissibility inquiry stage.&nbsp; A proper admissibility inquiry is only intended to determine whether the prior inconsistent statement has sufficient markers of reliability to allow the trier of fact to reasonably assess the appropriate weight it should be given.&nbsp; This is a contextual question that will change with the particular circumstances of each case.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[152]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on my analysis above, I do not think that a proper analysis was conducted in this case — particularly in relation to the opportunity for cross-examination and the consideration of other potential indicia of reliability.&nbsp; Accordingly, the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal should be upheld and a new trial ordered.&nbsp; Reliability may be properly assessed at the new trial and the evidence may be appropriately admitted or excluded upon consideration of all the relevant factors.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[153]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
