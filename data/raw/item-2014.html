No. 7209 (QL), at para. 10).&nbsp; Grenier J. accordingly discounted the allegations that the real property had been acquired with the proceeds of crime. This removed the foundation for the order.&nbsp; It was not asserted that the property was needed for the purpose of investigation or evidence.&nbsp; Accordingly, the two conditions for setting aside the order against an accused person under s. 462.34 were met with respect to the real property, and Grenier J.’s ruling to that effect should stand.</p>

C.</i>), interim measures that apply before conviction or even trial or charge, and provisions that facilitate the forfeiture of proceeds of crime once a finding of guilt has been made.&nbsp; That Part, at the relevant time, applied only to two new categories of offence: enterprise crime and designated drug offences (s.&nbsp;462.3 <i>Cr.

C.</i>).&nbsp; In all cases, however, the judge must make sure that the Attorney General has given appropriate undertakings to compensate the persons affected for any damages and costs that might be caused by the execution of the warrant of seizure or restraint order (ss.&nbsp;462.32(6) and 462.33(7) <i>Cr.

Dyment</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, at p.&nbsp;431).&nbsp; Similarly, two years later, Wilson J. defined a seizure as “the taking hold by a public authority of a thing belonging to a person against that person’s will” (<i>Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v.

C.</i>&nbsp; As well, under s.&nbsp;462.33(3)(<i>b</i>) (now s.&nbsp;462.331(1)), a judge may order that the management of the property be transferred to a person appointed by the judge.&nbsp; In that case, the decision involves a straightforward change in possession away from the person in possession of the property.&nbsp; In both cases, the property is placed under the legal and actual control of the criminal justice system.&nbsp; Moreover, the objectives of this measure for exercising control are twofold.&nbsp; First, Parliament intended to facilitate criminal investigations, by enacting procedural provisions that make property, and information about it, more readily accessible to the police and the Crown.&nbsp; Second, the purpose of those procedures is to prevent the disappearance or wasting of the property.&nbsp; Doing this makes it possible to punish the crimes in question more effectively, and facilitates the enforcement of the orders of forfeiture that may be made in future.&nbsp; We can conclude from those characteristics, and the context and objectives, that a restraint order must be regarded as a seizure within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

C.</i>, the respondents submit that Judge Pinard could not have made the restraint order or issued the seven special warrants of seizure, on the ground that an order of forfeiture could not have been made in relation to the vehicles in question under s. 462.37(1).&nbsp; The respondents answer that the reference to s. 462.37 is solely to subs. (1).&nbsp; Hence, absent any evidence to establish that the property was proceeds of crime obtained in relation to the offences alleged, no order of forfeiture, and accordingly no restraint order, could have been made, at least in relation to the immovables.&nbsp; The Crown replies that the reference to subs. (1) necessarily includes subs. (2).&nbsp; At that point, it would have only to establish that an order of forfeiture could have been made in relation to the property as <u>proceeds of crime</u>, and this would satisfy the requirements of subs. (1).&nbsp; The respondents then counter that in any event, there was no such evidence and the restraint order was therefore without any factual basis.</p>

Fremanco Ltd. </i>(1995), 135 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 327 (Nfld. S.C.), and&nbsp; <i>R. v. Lanteigne</i> (1994), 156 N.B.R. (2d) 17 (Q.B.)).&nbsp; In <i>Lanteigne</i>, Deschênes J., now of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, explained that the express reference to subs. (1) in the <u>English</u> version of s. 462.37(2) <i>Cr. C.</i> meant that any order of forfeiture made under that subsection was in fact made under subs. (1).&nbsp; Deschênes J. summarized his interpretation of the legislation and the reasons why he rejected the contrary position as follows, at paras.&nbsp;29,&nbsp;30 and&nbsp;32:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It is important to note that subs. 462.37(2) merely provides that in cases where the link or nexus has not been established, the court <u>may still</u> make an order of forfeiture under&nbsp; <u>subs. 462.37(1)</u> if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the property to be forfeited is “proceeds of crime”.&nbsp; Subsection&nbsp;462.37(2) merely provides the evidentiary rules to be applied so an order of forfeiture <u>under subs.&nbsp;462.37(1)</u> can be made.&nbsp; In fact, subs.&nbsp;462.37(2) specifically says that “the court may make an order of forfeiture <u>under subs. (1)</u>” in relation to that property.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I do not agree with the suggestions being made in <i>Seman</i> that subs.&nbsp;462.37(2) is a provision under which orders of forfeiture can be made.&nbsp; In my view, if an order of forfeiture is made, it is made under subs.&nbsp;462.37(1) and not&nbsp;462.37(2).</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">Accordingly, when faced with an application for a restraint order, the judge must consider whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the property sought to be restrained could eventually be the subject of an order of forfeiture under subs.&nbsp;462.37(1) in the sense that such property may be related to the enterprise crime offence under investigation.&nbsp; If the judge is not satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an order of forfeiture may eventually be made on the basis of a balance of probabilities referred to in subs.&nbsp;462.37(1), he or she must then go on to determine if there are reasonable grounds to believe that an order of forfeiture may be made under subs.&nbsp;462.37(1) on the basis that a judge may eventually grant an order of forfeiture upon being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the property in question is “proceeds of crime” despite the absence of a connection or nexus between the property and the enterprise crime offence or designated drug offence for which the person has been convicted.

Lamy</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 860, 2002 SCC 25).&nbsp; In fact, Parliament has confirmed the interpretation adopted by Deschênes J.: in 1999, the Parliament of Canada amended the French version of s.&nbsp;462.37(2) to include an express reference to subs.&nbsp;(1) of s.&nbsp;462.37.&nbsp; Based on that interpretation, we must determine whether the restraint order could have been made and the special warrants of seizure issued, and more specifically whether the reviewing judge was correct to quash them.&nbsp; First, however, we will have to turn to a question that is crucial to the outcome of this appeal: the nature and extent of the review of restraint orders and warrants of seizure.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It has long been a fundamental rule that a court order, made by a court having jurisdiction to make it, stands and is binding and conclusive unless it is set aside on appeal or lawfully quashed.&nbsp; It is also well settled in the authorities that such an order may not be attacked collaterally — and a collateral attack may be described as an attack made in proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation, or nullification of the order or judgment.&nbsp; Where appeals have been exhausted and other means of direct attack upon a judgment or order, such as proceedings by prerogative writs or proceedings for judicial review, have been unavailing, the only recourse open to one who seeks to set aside a court order is an action for review in the High Court where grounds for such a proceeding exist.&nbsp;</p>

Domm</i> (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 449.&nbsp; In that case, the Court of Appeal rejected a collateral attack on a non‑publication order made in a trial that was receiving a great deal of media attention.&nbsp; Domm was convicted of disobeying that order, and tried to argue that the order was constitutionally invalid in defence to the charges laid against him, which he could have done in the proceedings in relation to that order, and in appeal proceedings if necessary.&nbsp; His challenge failed.&nbsp; The trial judge and the Court of Appeal cited the rules against collateral attacks.&nbsp; However, Doherty J.A., the author of the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal, pointed out that exceptions had to be made to this principle, in the fundamental interests of the administration of justice, <i>inter alia</i> to ensure compliance with the rule of law.&nbsp; That objective demands that the reputation of the justice system be preserved while guaranteeing the orderly and functional administration of that system.&nbsp; In so far as they contribute to preserving those values, narrow limits may be placed on the rule against collateral attacks as, he noted, may be seen in the judgments of this Court, such as <i>Litchfield</i>, to which he referred to illustrate his comments (<i>Domm</i>, at pp.&nbsp;460‑62).&nbsp; Doherty J.A. noted on this point that in order to preserve the integrity of the rule of law, individuals must be provided with meaningful access to independent courts with the power to enforce the law by granting remedies to those individuals whose rights have been violated (<i>Domm</i>, at p.&nbsp;455).&nbsp; He added that this aspect of the values involved takes on particular importance in the case of a violation of the Constitution, which represents the foundational element of our country’s legal system:&nbsp; “where constitutional rights are implicated, the court must be particularly concerned about the availability of an effective remedy apart from collateral attack when considering whether an exception should be made to the rule against collateral attack” (<i>Domm</i>, at p.&nbsp;460).&nbsp; It is therefore important to avoid immunizing court orders from any form of review (<i>Domm</i>, at p.&nbsp;462).</p>
