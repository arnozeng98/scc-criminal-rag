 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Criminal law — Evidence — Admissibility — Hearsay — Principled exception to hearsay rule — Trial judge admitting witness’s out‑of‑court statement into evidence — Whether statement could be admitted into evidence under</i> <i>principled exception to rule against hearsay.</i></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following an incident involving the accused and the complainant at the school they attended, the accused was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm in the commission of an assault, and uttering threats. At trial, the complainant testified that he had entered a washroom at the school and had felt something on his hip while washing his hands. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol being held by the accused, used to threaten him. Two other students were present at the time. One of them, whom the Crown called as a witness at the accused’s trial, claimed on being questioned that he had no recollection of the events. The Crown therefore requested a <i>voir dire</i>, seeking to admit into evidence an out‑of‑court statement that had been given by that witness to the police investigators the day after the events. Accompanied at the time by his mother, the witness, who had been arrested and taken into custody in connection with the same incident, was questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and provided a statement in writing. Among other things, the witness admitted in his statement that he was in possession of two pellet pistols. The police conducted a search and recovered the pistols at the witness’s residence, in the location indicated in his statement.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge admitted the witness’s out‑of‑court statement into evidence. He found that the only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its material aspects, given the circumstances in which the statement was made and the seizure of pistols, which the trial judge considered to be corroborative evidence. Following the trial, the accused was found guilty of the three counts. The trial judge accepted the complainant’s version of events, which was supported for the most part by a surveillance video and the witness’s statement. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s decision to admit the statement into evidence and dismissed the accused’s appeal from his convictions. In addition to being of the view that the trial judge’s conclusion was justified, the majority pointed out the striking similarity between<span style="line-height:200%"> the complainant’s testimony and the witness’s statement, which, according to the majority, tended to confirm that the statement was sufficiently reliable</span>.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i> (Côté, Rowe and Kasirer&nbsp;JJ. dissenting)<span class="CitationCar"><span style="color:windowtext;font-style:normal">:</span></span> The appeal should be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> Karakatsanis, Martin, Jamal and <b>Moreau</b>&nbsp;JJ.: The trial judge erred in finding that the witness’s out‑of‑court statement had the required indicia of reliability and in admitting the statement into evidence at trial. The results of the search subsequently conducted at the witness’s residence do not meet the criteria for corroborative evidence set out in <i>R. v. Bradshaw</i>, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the statement do not support a finding that threshold reliability is established. Finally, the majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainant’s testimony, tendered outside of the <i>voir dire</i>, to establish the threshold reliability of the witness’s statement.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible. Under the principled exception, hearsay can exceptionally be admitted into evidence when the party tendering it demonstrates that the twin criteria of necessity and threshold reliability are met on a balance of probabilities. At the threshold reliability stage, one can only rely on corroborative evidence if it shows, when considered as a whole and in the circumstances of the case, that the only likely explanation for the hearsay statement is the declarant’s truthfulness about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement. In the absence of a connection between the corroborative evidence and the aspect sought to be proved, the evidence is quite simply of no assistance in determining whether that specific aspect is true or accurate; it merely corroborates the declarant’s credibility, the accused’s guilt or one party’s theory of the case, which is not sufficient. The combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances of the case, not the evidence taken in isolation, must rule out plausible alternative explanations for the material aspects of the statement. The absence of leading questions, inconsistent statements, promises of benefit or a criminal lifestyle simply points to an absence of factors that, if present, would detract from an otherwise trustworthy statement.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the Crown was required to show that the search results confirmed the accused’s role in the events if it was seeking to use the witness’s statement to establish the accused’s degree of involvement as well as the use of the weapon. There is no connection between the discovery of the pistols and the accused’s degree of involvement. The location of the pistols therefore cannot serve to show that threshold reliability is established through that aspect of the statement alone. Aside from establishing the truth of that aspect of the statement, that evidence is not capable of ruling out plausible alternative explanations for the events.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the witness’s statement raises particular reliability concerns. Because the witness is an accomplice, there is a very real danger that he tried to shift his responsibility onto the accused in his statement. It was to the witness’s advantage to provide an account that limited his participation to possession of the weapons, avoiding the charges that involved a greater degree of participation. <span style="line-height:200%">In the absence of external evidence confirming that the accused played the primary role in the washroom, the circumstantial guarantees cannot overcome the dangers presented by the witness’s statement.</span> Indeed,<span style="line-height:200%"> the absence of a criminal lifestyle is not at all clear. Moreover, the presence of the witness’s mother is not actually an indicium of reliability, because it is possible that the witness did not want his mother to know his degree of involvement, which could have motivated him to lie. The temporal proximity between the statement and the events is also not a useful factor in assessing the specific danger raised by the statement, namely, that the witness lied.</span> Lastly, the witness’s consultation with counsel does not make it possible to exclude the risk that he tried to minimize his responsibility. Nor are the indicia of procedural reliability reassuring, because the usual substitutes for the traditional safeguards are absent: there was no recording of the statement or the interview that preceded it, the witness was not under oath and was not given a warning by the investigators concerning the need to tell them the truth and the <span style="line-height:200%">consequences associated with lying, and the defence was deprived of any opportunity to cross‑examine the witness. In short, t</span>he combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances does not overcome the<i> </i>specific hearsay dangers raised by the out‑of‑court statement.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the complainant’s testimony, that evidence cannot be considered in analyzing the threshold reliability of the witness’s statement. Despite the fact that the complainant testified before the trial judge rendered his decision on the <i>voir dire</i>, his testimony was not part of the <i>voir dire</i>. On appeal, the appropriate mechanism for considering the complainant’s testimony that was not formally tendered in the <i>voir dire</i> is the curative proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which cannot be applied in this case because the trial judge’s admission of the statement is not a harmless or trivial error and it is not clear that the evidence pointing to the accused’s guilt is so overwhelming that any other verdict but a conviction would be impossible.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</i> <b>Côté</b>, Rowe and <b>Kasirer</b> (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. There is no reviewable error in the trial judge’s decision to admit the witness’s out‑of‑court statement into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay. However, there is agreement with the majority that, on appeal, the appropriate mechanism for considering the complainant’s testimony is the curative proviso.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge made no reviewable error in taking the discovery of the weapons into account as corroborative evidence in the assessment of threshold reliability. Given the charges laid and the burden they entailed for the prosecution, there is indeed a logical connection between the aspect of the statement pertaining to the presence of the weapon in the washroom, corroborated by the discovery of the weapon at the witness’s residence, and the aspect of the statement pertaining to the handling of that same weapon by the accused at the same time and in the same location. Such a logical connection makes it possible, in the assessment of threshold reliability, to consider corroborative evidence that does not relate to all of the material aspects of a statement. Threshold reliability can be established through the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances that constitute indicia of reliability, as those circumstances make remedying the insufficiency of the corroborative evidence possible.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of an error in principle that tainted the analysis at first instance during the consideration of certain circumstances in the assessment of threshold reliability, the trial judge’s decision was owed deference by the Court of Appeal. The relevance of the circumstances depends on the specific dangers associated with the hearsay in question and thus on the facts of the case. It would be wrong to categorize, objectively and independently of the facts of the case, the circumstances that are neutral or secondary and those that are more important. It is true that circumstances that in essence simply point to an absence of factors that, if present, would detract from an otherwise trustworthy statement do not provide a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. However, those circumstances are relevant. While such circumstances are not sufficient on their own to establish threshold reliability, such circumstances considered in conjunction with others (for example, corroboration even insufficient on its own), may lead to the conclusion that the statement has all the attributes required for acceptable threshold reliability. The fact that the witness spoke with counsel, the fact that his mother accompanied him when he made his statement and the fact that his mother was made aware of the tenor of the witness’s rights are indicia of reliability that the trial judge could validly consider.</p>

The results of the search subsequently conducted at the witness’s residence do not meet the <i>Bradshaw</i> criteria for corroborative evidence. Because the Crown sought to use the witness’s statement to establish the appellant’s role in the events, it was required to show that the search results confirmed that aspect of the statement. As for the circumstances surrounding the statement, they do not support a finding that threshold reliability is established.</p>

However, that provision cannot be applied in this case. It is therefore unnecessary to decide the discrete question of the self‑contained nature of the <i>voir dire</i> at the trial stage, especially since the trial judge expressly declined to consider evidence not tendered in the <i>voir dire</i>, by agreement of the parties.</p>

The appellant initially became angry but subsequently calmed down. Later, the complainant entered a washroom at the school and, while washing his hands, he felt something on his hip. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol being held by the appellant. Two other students, K.A. and a person named Fares, were also present. When asked by the complainant whether the pistol [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “was a real one”, the appellant replied: “Do you want to see if it’s a real one? I think I have a bullet left in it” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;II, at pp.&nbsp;305‑6). K.A. and Fares later caught up with the complainant and told him that the firearm was a fake.</p>

Corroborative evidence may be used in the analysis of threshold reliability only when that evidence, considered as a whole and in the circumstances of the case, shows that the only likely explanation for the statement is the statement’s truthfulness or accuracy regarding its material aspects. In particular, Bachand&nbsp;J.A. cited Karakatsanis&nbsp;J.’s majority reasons in <i>Bradshaw</i> stating that the function of corroborative evidence is to mitigate the need for cross‑examination on the point that the statement is tendered to prove.</p>

Therefore, if the Crown adduced the statement to prove that fact, the search results could not be used to establish the statement’s admissibility. This remained true even if the Crown also wished to adduce the statement to show that a weapon had been used. The search results could then be used to establish the reliability of the statement in relation to this second aspect, but not in relation to the first.</p>

The trial judge relied on certain circumstances that, in light of the case law, had to be regarded as having very limited weight. K.A. had reasons to lie, since he was suspected of having committed offences in connection with the events of February 24, 2016. The statement [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “certainly had the effect of diminishing his own role while attributing responsibility for the offences mainly to the appellant” (para.&nbsp;45). The trial judge gave little weight to K.A.’s interest in not being identified as the person who had used the pistol and threatened the complainant.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par43">43</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible (see, e.g., <i>Bradshaw</i>, at<i> </i>paras.&nbsp;1 and 21). Its presumptive inadmissibility is due to the fact that it is often difficult to assess the truth of a statement made outside the courtroom. In <i>Bradshaw</i>, Karakatsanis&nbsp;J. explained that, generally, “hearsay is not taken under oath, the trier of fact cannot observe the declarant’s demeanor as she makes the statement, and hearsay is not tested through cross‑examination” (para.&nbsp;20). However, “[t]he truth‑seeking process of a trial is predicated on the presentation of evidence in court” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;19), and “our adversary system is based on the assumption that sources of untrustworthiness or inaccuracy can best be brought to light under the test of cross‑examination” (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;48). It is “mainly because of the inability to put hearsay evidence to that test” that such evidence is presumptively inadmissible (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;48; see also <i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;1).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par44">44</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admission of hearsay may therefore “<span style="color:black">compromise trial fairness and the trial’s truth‑seeking process”</span> (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;20). It is possible that the statement has been “inaccurately recorded, and the trier of fact cannot easily investigate the declarant’s perception, memory, narration, or sincerity” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;20, citing <i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;2). There is thus a risk that such evidence “may be afforded more weight than it deserves” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;21, quoting <i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;35).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

Over time, the case law therefore developed categorical exceptions to the exclusionary rule and, ultimately, a more flexible approach. Under the principled exception, “hearsay can exceptionally be admitted into evidence when the party tendering it demonstrates that the twin criteria of necessity and threshold reliability are met on a balance of probabilities” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;23, citing <i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;47). To establish the threshold reliability of a statement, a party may demonstrate its procedural or substantive reliability.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

Triers of fact must have “a satisfactory basis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to rationally evaluate the truth and accuracy of the hearsay statement” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;28). Substitutes for the traditional safeguards “include a video recording of the statement, the presence of an oath, and a warning about the consequences of lying” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;28, citing <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740,<i> </i>at<i> </i>pp.&nbsp;795‑96). Some form of cross‑examination of the declarant, such as preliminary inquiry testimony, is usually required (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;28).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

To determine whether this is the case, trial judges may consider the circumstances in which the statement was made as well as the evidence that corroborates or conflicts with it. The standard is a high one (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at<i> </i>para.&nbsp;31). That being said, it is not necessary for reliability to be established with absolute certainty. Rather, judges must be satisfied that the statement is “so reliable that contemporaneous cross‑examination of the declarant would add little if anything to the process” (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;49, quoted in <i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;31). In other words, the evidence must be “sufficiently reliable to overcome the dangers arising from the difficulty of testing it” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;26, quoting <i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;49). As Karakatsanis&nbsp;J. explained in <i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;31:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantive reliability is established when the statement “is made under circumstances which substantially negate the possibility that the declarant was untruthful or mistaken” ([<i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915], at p.&nbsp;933); “under such circumstances that even a sceptical caution would look upon it as trustworthy” (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;62, citing [J. H.&nbsp;Wigmore, <i>Evidence in Trials at Common Law</i> (2nd ed. 1923), vol.&nbsp;III], at p.&nbsp;154); when the statement is so reliable that it is “unlikely to change under cross‑examination” (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;107; <i>Smith</i>, at p.&nbsp;937); when “there is no real concern about whether the statement is true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about” (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para.&nbsp;62); when the only likely explanation is that the statement is true ([<i>R. v. U.&nbsp;(F.J.)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764], at para.&nbsp;40).</p>

It submits that K.A.’s statement serves to establish two material aspects: (1)&nbsp;the use of the weapon and (2)&nbsp;the appellant’s degree of involvement. For the purposes of analysis, let us assume that this is indeed the case. The Crown urges us to find that, since the search results corroborate the first aspect, they can serve to corroborate the statement in its entirety. According to the Crown, this is because it is not necessary for evidence to corroborate all material aspects of a statement: it is sufficient for it to corroborate just one aspect.</p>

In no way can this evidence confirm that it was the appellant who handled a pistol in the washroom, and not K.A. (despite the fact that it was K.A. who was in possession of the weapons the next day). That aspect of the statement puts in issue not merely the handling of a weapon, but rather the handling of a weapon <i>by the appellant</i>. Consequently, it is necessary to determine how the principles set out in <i>Bradshaw</i> apply where several material aspects of a statement are not connected with each other.</p>

The function of corroborative evidence is thus to “mitigate the need for cross‑examination, not generally, but <i>on the point</i> that the hearsay is tendered to prove” (para.&nbsp;45 (emphasis in original)).</p>

However, this does not mitigate the need for a connection between the evidence and the aspect sought to be proved. In the absence of such a connection, the evidence is quite simply of no assistance in determining whether that specific aspect is true or accurate; it merely corroborates the declarant’s credibility, the accused’s guilt or one party’s theory of the case, which is not sufficient (see <i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;44; see also paras.&nbsp;45‑46 and 72). Evidence that is not connected with the material aspects of the statement is therefore not capable, even in combination with the circumstances of the case, of ruling out plausible alternative explanations for those aspects.</p>

When evidence merely confirms one material aspect of a statement and no more, the support it provides for other material aspects derives entirely from the fact that it boosts the declarant’s credibility. This holds true regardless of the materiality of the aspect of the statement that is confirmed by the evidence. As established in <i>Bradshaw</i>, it is not sufficient for evidence to support the declarant’s credibility generally, and such evidence cannot be used to assess the admissibility of other aspects of the statement.</p>

The <i>Bradshaw</i> framework serves to ensure that corroborative evidence is used only in cases where it bears on the aspect sought to be proved by adducing the statement. The requirement for a connection between the corroborative evidence and the aspect in question flows from the role that such evidence must play.

She explained that in order to preserve “the distinction between threshold and ultimate reliability and to prevent the <i>voir dire </i>from overtaking the trial”, it must be possible to distinguish between evidence that is admissible to establish threshold reliability and evidence that is admissible in the main trial (para.&nbsp;42). Furthermore, “[l]imiting the use of corroborative evidence as a basis for admitting hearsay also mitigates the risk that inculpatory hearsay will be admitted simply because evidence of the accused’s guilt is strong” (para.&nbsp;42). Indeed, “[t]he stronger the case against the accused, the easier it would be to admit flawed and unreliable hearsay against him” (para.&nbsp;42). The particular role of corroborative evidence in the analysis of threshold reliability informs the limitations on its use:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The limited inquiry into corroborative evidence flows from the fact that, at the threshold reliability stage, corroborative evidence is used in a manner that is qualitatively distinct from the manner in which the trier of fact uses it to assess the statement’s ultimate reliability. As Lederman, Bryant and Fuerst explain, at the threshold reliability stage,</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [t]he use of corroborative evidence should be directed to the reliability of the hearsay. Certain items of evidence can take on a corroborative character and be supportive of the Crown’s theory when considered in the context of the evidence as a whole. Such evidence relates to the merits of the case rather than to the limited focus of the <i>voir dire</i> in assessing the trustworthiness of the statement and is properly left to the ultimate trier of fact.</p>

In <i>Youvarajah</i>, Karakatsanis&nbsp;J. explained that “[c]riminal law is generally and rightfully suspicious of allegations made by a person against an accomplice. It has long been recognized that evidence of one accomplice against another may be motivated by self‑interest and that it is dangerous to rely on such evidence absent other evidence which tends to confirm it” (para.&nbsp;62). Indeed, “the underlying rationale for the admissibility of admissions as against the party making them falls away when they are sought to be used against a third party” (para.&nbsp;59). This is especially true when the party making the admissions assumes less responsibility than they attribute to the third party, thus potentially facing less severe consequences than the third party (see <i>Youvarajah</i>, at para.&nbsp;60; see also <i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;92).</p>

Although K.A. incriminated himself to some extent, he portrayed his own conduct as being much less serious than that of the appellant. As the Crown points out, it is true that K.A. described the incident as an immature joke, which tended to minimize the extent of the appellant’s responsibility. However, in doing so, K.A. did not assume any greater responsibility himself; instead, he played down the seriousness of the incident as such. The specific risk in this case is not that K.A. wanted to exaggerate the appellant’s involvement in the abstract, but rather that he did so with the aim of evading his own responsibility. In short, there is a very real danger that K.A. tried to shift his responsibility onto the appellant in his statement. Indeed, as the appellant notes, K.A.’s statement places much of the responsibility on Fares and the appellant.</p>

Accordingly, it is instead a neutral factor. The temporal proximity between the statement and the events serves to mitigate the risk that K.A. did not have an accurate recollection of the events.

Moreover, in <i>L.T.H.</i>, the Court was dealing with s.&nbsp;146(2)(b) of the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>,<i> </i>S.C. 2002, c.&nbsp;1, a provision whose scope extends beyond simply consulting with counsel.</p>

The usual substitutes for the traditional safeguards are absent. There was no recording of the statement or the interview that preceded it (of which the police investigator had only a limited recollection at the <i>voir dire</i>). K.A. was not under oath, and although he was read his rights, he was not given a warning by the investigators concerning the need to tell them the truth and the <span style="line-height:200%">consequences associated with lying (see <i>B. (K.G.)</i>, at pp.&nbsp;795‑96). In addition, since K.A. claimed to have no recollection of the events, the defence was deprived of any opportunity to cross‑examine him. Yet some form of cross‑examination is usually required to establish procedural reliability (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;28).</span></p>

It cannot be said that cross‑examining K.A. at the time he made his statement to the police would have added little if anything to the process. There are many aspects of the statement that, without cross‑examination, remain impossible to verify. For example, there is no way to verify that K.A. was not aware of the issues between the appellant and the complainant or that the pistols belonged to Fares. There remains a real concern regarding the truthfulness of the statement given the opportunity that K.A. had to minimize his responsibility and to exaggerate the appellant’s. The indicia of reliability do not rule out this possibility. Thus, the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances does not overcome “the<i> specific hearsay dangers</i> raised by the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. statement” given by K.A., such that its “<i>only likely explanation</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is [K.A.’s] truthfulness about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement” (<i>Bradshaw</i>, at<i> </i>para.&nbsp;47 (emphasis in original)).</p>

As discussed above, despite the fact that the complainant testified before the trial judge rendered his decision on the <i>voir dire</i>, his testimony was not part of the <i>voir dire</i>. In fact, the trial judge specifically asked the parties if all of the trial evidence would be tendered in the <i>voir dire</i>, and the defence refused to consent. The parties agreed that only K.A.’s demeanour during his testimony would be considered. It was therefore clear that the complainant’s testimony would not form part of the threshold reliability analysis. Nevertheless, at the end of its analysis, the majority of the Court of Appeal wrote that the [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “striking similarity” between the complainant’s testimony and K.A.’s statement tended to confirm that the statement was sufficiently reliable to be admissible (para.&nbsp;71). According to the Crown, this Court should also consider that evidence in analyzing threshold reliability, despite the fact that it was not formally tendered in the <i>voir dire</i>.</p>

It therefore cannot be concluded that the trial judge’s admission of the statement was a harmless or trivial error. Nor is it “clear that the evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused is so overwhelming that any other verdict but a conviction would be impossible” (see <i>R. v.

With respect for our colleague’s views, and substantially for the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, Doyon and Cournoyer&nbsp;JJ.A., we are of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed (2022 QCCA 1013, 82 C.R. (7th) 373). We agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that there is no reviewable error in the trial judge’s decision to admit K.A.’s out‑of‑court statement into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay.</p>

The dissenting judge found that the trial judge erred in relying on evidence that only partially corroborated the material aspects of K.A.’s statement to assess the admissibility of the statement as a whole. The dissenting judge also held that the trial judge committed an error in principle in considering circumstances which had only very relative weight.</p>

The respondent also notes the following comment made by the majority in the second last paragraph of its reasons: [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “Finally, it is difficult to ignore the striking similarity between the victim’s testimony and the statement by K.A., who obviously did not discuss the content of his statement with the victim, which tends to confirm that the hearsay evidence was sufficiently reliable to be admissible” (para.&nbsp;71). According to the respondent, the Court of Appeal could validly consider the complainant’s testimony at trial, which was given before the closing of the <i>voir dire</i> but was not produced on it.</p>

However, on the question of the self‑contained nature of the <i>voir dire</i>, we agree with the conclusion of our colleague Moreau&nbsp;J. First, the curative proviso is the appropriate mechanism for considering, on appeal, evidence admitted at trial that was not produced on the <i>voir dire</i>, like the complainant’s testimony in this case (para.&nbsp;4). Second, it is not necessary for this Court to address, in the context of this appeal, the distinct question of the self‑contained nature of the <i>voir dire</i> at the trial stage (at para.&nbsp;79), especially since the appellant himself rightly recognizes that the majority’s comment was an <i>obiter dictum</i>, made as a passing remark,<i> </i>regarding a question that was not raised at first instance.</p>

In itself, the question of whether a statement may be introduced into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay is a question of law, which is reviewable on a standard of correctness on appeal (see <i>R. v. Le</i>, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para.&nbsp;23; <i>R. v. Youvarajah</i>, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at para.&nbsp;31). However, the findings of fact made by the trial judge are entitled to deference. Similarly, “absent an error in principle, the trial judge’s determination of threshold reliability is entitled to deference” (<i>Youvarajah</i>, at para.&nbsp;31; see also <i>R. v. Couture</i>, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at para.&nbsp;81).</p>

Bradshaw</i>, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865, the appellant argues that the search results cannot, in this case, constitute evidence which is relevant to the substantive reliability inquiry. He agrees with the dissenting judge that the trial judge erred in considering the search results in the assessment of threshold reliability because that evidence [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “was irrelevant to the threshold reliability analysis with respect to K.A.’s assertion as to the appellant’s conduct and comments during the incident in the washroom” (C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;35).</p>

Doyon and Cournoyer&nbsp;JJ.A. rightly pointed out that at the time of the <i>voir dire</i> on the admissibility of K.A.’s statement, the appellant had not yet testified on the merits and nothing had been admitted. The Crown therefore had to prove all of the essential elements of each offence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

Given the charges laid and the burden they entailed for the prosecution, there is indeed a logical connection between the aspect of the statement pertaining to the presence of the weapon in the washroom, corroborated by the discovery of the weapon at K.A.’s residence, and the aspect of the statement pertaining to the handling of that same weapon by the appellant at the same time and in the same location. While K.A.’s statement does evince the aforementioned material yet distinct aspects, they are logically intertwined.</p>

Evidence of this nature generally cannot suffice, on its own, to establish threshold reliability. Our Court has previously held that this threshold can then be met through the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances that constitute indicia of reliability (see <i>Bradshaw</i>, at paras.&nbsp;44, 47 and 57).</p>

Hall</i>, 2018 MBCA 122, [2019] 1 W.W.R. 612, that “the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. submission that substantive reliability requires the existence of corroborative evidence on all material aspects of the hearsay statement must be rejected” (para.&nbsp;85). In such a case, threshold substantive reliability may be established by the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances that constitute indicia of reliability, as those circumstances make remedying the insufficiency of the corroborative evidence possible (see <i>Hall</i>, at paras.&nbsp;82‑85; <i>R. v. Burns</i>, 2016 SKCA 67, 337 C.C.C. (3d) 523, at para.&nbsp;30; <i>R. v. Allary</i>, 2021 SKCA 110). As the majority of the Court of Appeal in our case pointed out (at para.&nbsp;53), this approach reflects the inherent flexibility of the principled exception (see, in particular, <i>R. v. U.&nbsp;(F.J.)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764, at para.&nbsp;35; <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para.&nbsp;45).</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] We disagree with our colleague, who is of the opinion that this corroboration can confirm only the second aspect of the statement, and not the first aspect, which concerns the appellant’s participation. Evidence cannot be split up in this manner to limit its corroboration to one material aspect at the expense of the other. At that stage of the trial, the scope of the statement was much broader than that described by our colleague, and the discovery of a weapon, according to the judge, corroborated the entire statement.

The appellant claims that this error was committed in weighing the circumstances relating to threshold reliability. In that weighing exercise, the trial judge allegedly failed to distinguish the circumstances that provided a true circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness from those that had only relative weight, contrary to the teachings of <i>Bradshaw</i> and <i>Couture</i>. In the appellant’s opinion, the dissenting judge correctly stated that the trial judge [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “relied mainly on circumstances identical or similar to those that the Supreme Court considered as having very relative weight in [<i>Couture</i> and <i>Bradshaw</i>], without ever mentioning that they could play at the most a secondary role in the threshold reliability analysis” (C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;42 (footnote omitted)). The dissenting judge found that [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “[t]he possibility that [the trial judge] gave them too much weight is therefore real” (para.&nbsp;42).</p>

With respect, this is not permitted by the standard of review applicable to the assessment of threshold reliability, which, as noted, is entitled to deference on appeal (<i>Youvarajah</i>, at para.&nbsp;31; <i>Couture</i>, at para.&nbsp;81).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

That being so, it would be wrong to categorize, objectively and independently of the facts of the case, the circumstances that are neutral or secondary and those that are more important. This is therefore not a process that the trial judge is required to undertake.</p>

It must not be forgotten, however, that, in the same paragraph, this Court acknowledged that those circumstances are “relevant”. In the words of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case, while such circumstances are not sufficient on their own to establish threshold reliability, [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “the fact remains that such circumstances, considered in conjunction with others (for example, corroboration even insufficient on its own), may lead to the conclusion that the statement has all the attributes required for acceptable threshold reliability” (para.&nbsp;62). This reading of <i>Bradshaw </i>is also consistent with <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, where this Court found that “the absence of any reason to expect fabrication in the statement” was relevant to the analysis (p.&nbsp;547).</p>

It is thus neither necessary nor appropriate for us to repeat the analysis of the circumstances.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par105">105</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this point, and with all due respect, we note only that the dissenting judge seems to have committed two errors in his analysis of the circumstances. First, contrary to what his reasons suggested at para.&nbsp;38, <i>Bradshaw</i> does not impose a rigid rule that substantive reliability is always subject to a high threshold; it merely recognizes that the greater the risk posed by the statement in light of the facts of the case, the greater the guarantees of trustworthiness required to rule out that risk (see <i>R. v. Larue</i>, 2018 YKCA 9, 434 D.L.R. (4th) 155, at paras.&nbsp;99‑101, aff’d 2019 SCC 25, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 398; <i>R. v. Bernard</i>, 2018 ABCA 396, 80 Alta. L.R. (6th) 258, at para.&nbsp;24). Second, [<span style="font-variant:
small-caps">translation</span>] “the fact that the declarant received advice from a relative or counsel before making their statement” is not a circumstance that “simply point[s] to an absence of factors that, if present, would detract from an otherwise trustworthy statement” (C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;39, citing <i>Bradshaw</i>, at para.&nbsp;92). In <i>R. v. L.T.H.</i>, 2008 SCC 49, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 739, at para.&nbsp;38, this Court expressly recognized that s.&nbsp;146(2)(b) of the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002, c.&nbsp;1, which deals with, among other things, the right of a young person to consult counsel and certain adults whom the young person trusts, “[is] indeed meant to ensure the reliability of a statement”. In our opinion, the involvement of the relative or counsel achieves this objective in particular by ensuring that the declarant understood the gravity of the situation and their obligation to tell the truth (see C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;64, citing <i>L.T.H.</i>, at para.&nbsp;38). The fact that K.A. spoke with counsel, the fact that his mother accompanied him when he made his statement and the fact that his mother was made aware of the tenor of K.A.’s rights are therefore indicia of reliability that the trial judge could validly consider.</p>

We also take due note, however, that this question was not raised by the appellant in support of his appeal and that, according to him, it was not raised before the trial judge. The appellant is of the view — and rightly so — that the majority’s comment is an <i>obiter</i>. The question is moot in the present appeal given that neither party challenges before us the trial judge’s decision to not consider the complainant’s testimony, a decision that was, we might add, made in accordance with the parties’ wishes.</p>
