   <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law—Common assault charge—Non-appearance of informant—Refusal of Crown’s request for adjournment—Charge dismissed—New information sworn in identical terms to first information—Plea of autrefois acquit—Whether plea available in respect of summary conviction offence—Order of dismissal does not supplant right to raise plea—No requirement for trial “on the merits”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 734, 743(1), (2).</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Accused was charged with common assault. He pleaded not guilty and the matter was adjourned for trial. At the trial the Crown applied for an adjournment as the complainant was not present. The application was refused. As the Crown called no evidence, the charge was dismissed and the accused was discharged.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">A week later, the complainant swore a new information in terms identical to the first information. When the matter came on before another provincial court judge, the accused entered a plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>and the charge was dismissed. In a Crown appeal by way of stated case, it was held that the plea was available in respect of a summary conviction offence and that it was applicable in the present case. The Crown took a further, unsuccessful appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and finally sought leave to appeal to this Court. Leave was granted on the following grounds: 1. That the Appellate Division erred in law in holding that an order of dismissal issued pursuant to s.&nbsp;743 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>does not supplant the common law right to raise the special plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>in a summary conviction court. 2. That the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court erred in law in holding that the information was dealt with on the merits.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 381]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">: The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">As to the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>at common law, the formal status of the plea and the pleading and procedural technicalities of an earlier day should not stand in the way of an accused raising as a defence the fact that he has been previously acquitted of the offence with which he now stands charged. The proper procedure in summary conviction matters is not to raise the special plea of <i>autrefois acquit, </i>but simply to enter a general plea of not guilty embracing the concept of <i>res judicata. </i>Technically, such a general plea is not one of <i>autrefois acquit </i>but as stated in <i>Flatman v. Light, </i>[1946] 1 K.B. 414 at p.&nbsp;419, “…that does not matter”. The court gives effect to the broad maxim, <i>nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa. </i>The charge has been dismissed by a court of competent jurisdiction and the accused shall not be charged again with the same matter.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The submission that the special pleas authorized in Part XVII (ss. 534-537) of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>headed “Procedure by Indictment”, are not available in respect of summary conviction offences, provision for which is contained in Part XXIV, failed. Something akin to the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>was available at common law to a defendant accused of an offence punishable by summary conviction. That being so, it would take language other than that found in ss. 534 to 537 to manifest an intent on the part of Parliament to take away such defence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Under s.&nbsp;734, the <i>Code </i>provides that where, as here, the defendant appears for the trial and the prosecutor does not appear, the summary conviction court may dismiss the information. Under s.&nbsp;743, it is then open to the defendant to request the court to draw up an order of dismissal, a certified copy of which, without further proof, is a bar to any subsequent proceedings against him in respect of the same cause. However, the failure of the defendant in the present case to obtain a certificate was not fatal to his position. Section 743 is intended to supplement, and not to supplant, common law rights. It is in aid, rather than in derogation, of those rights. The certificate affords a mechanism, borrowed from English statute law of some antiquity, facilitating proof of dismissal of an information. The granting of a certificate is in the nature of an administrative act recording the judgment of the summary conviction court. It is not a judicial act.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 382]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">With respect to the second ground upon which leave to appeal was granted, should the accused avail himself of the certificate provided for in s.&nbsp;743(1), subs. (2) bars any subsequent proceedings in respect of the same cause, without reference to the events giving rise to the dismissal. In principle, there is no reason why a different situation ought to prevail where the defendant has not obtained the certified copy. Nor, in principle, is it easy to distinguish between the situation where the Crown leads evidence which fails to make out a case for the defendant to answer and the situation where, as here, no evidence is led. So long as the case has proceeded to a verdict and a dismissal, that should be sufficient.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The term “on the merits” does nothing to further the test for the application of the <i>bis vexari </i>maxim. There is no basis, in the <i>Code </i>or in the common law, for any superadded requirement that there must be a trial “on the merits”. That phrase merely serves to emphasize the general requirement that the previous dismissal must have been made by a court of competent jurisdiction, whose proceedings were free from jurisdictional error and which rendered judgment on the charge.</span></p>

If so, is the plea available when in the earlier proceeding the charge is dismissed following non‑appearance of the informant and refusal of an adjournment? Judicial authority and textbook opinion have been divided on both issues. Thus far, the respondent Riddle has succeeded in three Courts in Alberta.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">A week later, the complainant swore a new information in terms identical to the first information. When the matter came on before another provincial court judge, Riddle entered a plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>and the charge was dismissed. A Crown appeal by stated case was heard by Laycraft J., who in a carefully considered judgment held that the plea was available in respect of a summary conviction offence and that it was applicable in the present case. The Crown took a further, unsuccessful appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and finally sought leave to appeal to this Court. Leave was granted on the following grounds:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Here the Crown appellant relies upon the cases of <i>Cooper </i>and <i>Osborne. </i>In <i>Osborne, </i>Limerick J.A. laid emphasis upon the historic availability of the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>in respect of indictable offences and not in summary conviction matters. Those involved in summary conviction courts “were not expected to have the nicety of legal perception to comprehend the legal concepts involved” in such pleas and, instead, more general powers of dismissal were confided to Justices of the Peace. Such powers were unnecessary in indictable matters, where the special pleas and the participation of the Attorney General assured greater control over the process. Limerick J.A. then finds further support for this distinction in the presence of ss. 535 to 537 in the “Procedure by Indictment” part of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and an absence of corresponding provisions in Part XXIV. In the result, he held that the intention of Parliament was “to replace those special pleas in summary conviction cases with the statutory relief</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 387]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">afforded by s.&nbsp;743 of <i>Code</i>.”</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">With respect, it would seem that those finding <i>autrefois acquit </i>not available in summary conviction cases at common law give to that term its narrow and specialized meaning. Professor Friedland in his book, <i>Double Jeopardy </i>(1969), describes the special pleas at pp.&nbsp;113-4, noting the need for a formal record of the former judgment, carefully engrossed on parchment. Supported by the older case of <i>Weymss v. Hopkins</i><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The special pleas are not strictly appropriate for cases tried by courts of summary jurisdiction, but the same result is reached by giving effect to the maxim <i>Nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">A technical approach was rejected by Lord Goddard in <i>Flatman </i>and such a narrow approach was dismissed by Blackburn J. in <i>Weymss </i>in these words:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I think the fact that the jurisdiction of the justices is created by statute makes no difference. Where the conviction is by a Court of competent jurisdiction, it matters not whether the conviction is by a summary proceeding before justices or by trial before a jury. (p. 38)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Further down the same page, Blackburn J. makes reference to the availability of a certificate “freeing [a person] from further proceedings, civil or criminal, for the same cause”, which goes further than the common law, but states explicitly that “in this case we must rely upon the common law”, and this is in relation to a summary conviction matter.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In his perceptive article, “<i>Res Judicata </i>in the Criminal Law” (1961), 3 Melbourne U.L. Rev. 101, Professor Howard states at p.112:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">At the present day the distinction between courts of summary jurisdiction and superior courts occasions no difficulty. Although it is pedantically true that an <i>autrefois plea </i>can be made only to an indictment, there never has been any real doubt that an equivalent objection can be set up in summary proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>Paley on Summary Convictions </i>(9th ed., 1926) at p.&nbsp;367, the “<i>bis vexari</i>” maxim is stated to be of general application to civil and criminal proceedings, to actions, orders, summary convictions and indictments. The text continues:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Consequently, at common law a former conviction or acquittal, whether on a criminal summary proceeding or an indictment, will be an answer to an information of a criminal nature before justices <i>founded on the same facts.</i></span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Counsel for the Crown contends that the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>is only available to a defendant in the case of a prosecution by indictment. Both the pleas of <i>autrefois acquit </i>and <i>autrefois convict </i>are founded upon the maxim “<i>nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa</i>” and at common law were always available to a defendant whether proceeded against by way of summary conviction or upon indictment.

This applies not only to indictable offences, but also to courts whose jurisdiction is entirely</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">and at p.&nbsp;1532:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is doubtful if the plea of <i>autrefois </i>is applicable to proceedings before justices, because of the special rules as to raising such a plea. It is probably more correct to say that what a court of summary jurisdiction must do is to give effect to the maxim <i>nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa: Flatman v. Light, </i>[1946] K.B. 414, per Lord Goddard, C.J.; cf. <i>In re Deserted Wives’ Maintenance Act; In re Wilson, </i>[1948] 1 W.W.R. 680 (B.C.); <i>Burns v. Gan </i>(1955), 112 C.C.C. 395 (Ont.).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Crankshaw’s Criminal Code of Canada </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(7th ed., 1959) p.&nbsp;748, is to the same effect.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The formal status of the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>and the pleading and procedural technicalities of an earlier day should not stand in the way of an accused raising as a defence the fact that he has been previously acquitted of the offence with which he now stands charged. The proper procedure in summary conviction matters is not to raise the special plea of <i>autrefois acquit, </i>but simply to enter a general plea of not guilty embracing the concept of <i>res judicata. </i>Technically, such a general plea is not one of <i>autrefois acquit </i>but, as Lord Goddard was moved to say in <i>Flatman v. Light, supra </i>at p.&nbsp;419, “…that does not matter”. The court gives effect to the broad maxim, <i>nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa. </i>The charge has been dismissed by a court of competent jurisdiction and the accused shall not be charged again with the same matter.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><i><u><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal Code </span></u></i><u><span lang="EN-CA">Provisions</span></u></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The foregoing discussion has been concerned with the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>at common law. What concerns the Court in large measure in this appeal, however, are special statutory provisions found in the <i>Criminal Code </i>and their effect. I turn then to the <i>Code.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The first reference should be to ss. 534 to 537 inclusive, coupled with s.&nbsp;502. Section 535(1) provides specifically that an accused may plead the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 390]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">special plea of (<i>a</i>) <i>autrefois acquit, </i>(<i>b</i>) <i>autrefois convict, </i>and (<i>c</i>) pardon. The <i>Code </i>provides further that the pleas shall be disposed of by the judge without a jury before the accused is called upon to plead further. Sections 534 to 537 are found in Part XVII of the <i>Code, </i>headed “Procedure by Indictment”, and this has given rise to the argument that the special pleas are not available in respect of summary conviction offences, provision for which is contained in Part XXIV of the <i>Code.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">1 do not think this submission can prevail. Something akin to the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>was available at common law to a defendant accused of an offence punishable by summary conviction. That being so, it would take language other than that found in ss. 534 to 537 to manifest an intent on the part of Parliament to take away such defence. The <i>Code </i>does not contain all the criminal law and Part XXIV does not contain all of the law relating to summary convictions. No authority is needed for the proposition that common law rights are not to be held to be taken away or affected by statute unless such an intent is made manifest by clear language or necessary implication. In the absence of irreconcilable conflict, full effect should be given to both common law and statute. Section 7(3) of the <i>Code </i>expressly continues in force every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a defence to a charge, except in so far as altered by, or inconsistent with, the <i>Code </i>or any other act of Parliament. Thus, while the special plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>is not mentioned in the summary conviction provisions of the <i>Code, </i>one would have to take an unduly technical and narrow interpretation of that objection and ignore the common law of <i>Flatman </i>and <i>Weymss </i>in order to accept the position urged by the Crown.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Part XXIV of the <i>Code </i>contains two sections, 734 and 743, which, for ease of reference, I will set out below:</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 391]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">734. Where, in proceedings to which this Part applies, the defendant appears for the trial and the prosecutor, having had due notice does not appear, the summary conviction court may dismiss the information or may adjourn the trial to some other time upon such terms as it considers proper.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">743. (1) Where the summary conviction court dismisses an information it may, if requested by the defendant, draw up an order of dismissal, and shall give to the defendant a certified copy of the order of dismissal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) A copy of an order of dismissal, certified in accordance with subsection&nbsp;(1) is, without further proof, a bar to any subsequent proceedings against the defendant in respect of the same cause.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The <i>Code </i>is clear in providing that where, as here, the defendant appears for the trial and the prosecutor does not appear, the summary conviction court may dismiss the information. It is then open to the defendant to request the court to draw up an order of dismissal, a certified copy of which, without further proof, is a bar to any subsequent proceedings against him in respect of the same cause. No certificate was requested in the present case. It is the position of the Crown that failure to obtain a certificate is fatal to the position of the defendant. The Crown relies on the argument, reflected in the first question upon which leave to appeal was granted, that s.&nbsp;743 supplants the common law right to raise the special plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>in a summary conviction court. The effect of the argument is that a successful defendant must obtain a certificate of dismissal at the time of trial, failing which he has no protection from a second information. Nothing in the language of the <i>Code </i>leads to that conclusion. Section 743 is intended in my view to supplement, and not to supplant, common law rights. It is in aid, rather than in derogation, of those rights. The certificate affords a mechanism, borrowed from English statute law of some antiquity, facilitating proof of dismissal of an information.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 743 only deals with an order of dismissal and the effect of a certified copy of that order. It is, at the very least, implicit in that section&nbsp;that every dismissal for failure of the prosecutor to appear will be a bar to subsequent proceedings. As</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 392]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Friedland points out in his book, at p.&nbsp;57, that section&nbsp;can hardly be a “complete code applicable to summary proceedings in place of the special pleas spelled out for indictable offences… because, for one reason, no provision is made for a previous conviction”. In that author’s view, with which I agree, all that s.&nbsp;743 does “is to allow the accused to prove his defence by means of a certified copy of the order of dismissal—a procedure which would probably not be available to him at common law”. In <i>R. v. Cooper, supra, </i>the narrow, and in my opinion mistaken, view was taken that the pleas of <i>autrefois acquit </i>and <i>autrefois convict </i>were retained only in respect of a trial upon indictment and that, in summary conviction matters, the only method of raising the question of <i>res judicata </i>was by recourse to s.&nbsp;743.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">With respect to the failure of a defendant to obtain a certified copy of a certificate of dismissal, it is worth noting that in <i>The Queen v. Hutchins</i><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[14]</span></span></span></a>, Lush J., speaking of a certificate of dismissal under s.&nbsp;14 of 11 &amp; 12 Vict:, c. 43, said, p.&nbsp;65:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Now I am of opinion that the first decision was binding on the local board. It is true that the appellant had not obtained a written certificate of dismissal, but that is not of the essence. I take the written certificate to be an artificial but convenient mode of proving the dismissal provided by the <i>Act, </i>but not necessary to the validity of the decision pronounced. I should compare it to the convenient mode of proving a previous conviction by a certificate signed by the clerk of assize. Here the notebook of the magistrates was produced shewing the summons, the names of the parties, the nature of the complaint, the hearing, and the decision that the summons was dismissed on the ground that the street in question was a highway.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The policy of Parliament seems plain. An information may be dismissed on non-appearance of the prosecutor, and the defendant is then in a position to obtain a certificate securing him from further proceedings for the same offence. The granting of a certificate is in the nature of an administrative act recording the judgment of the summary con-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="FR">[Page 393]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR">viction court. </span><span lang="EN-CA">It is not a judicial act, as Lord Campbell C.J. said in <i>Hancock v. Somes</i><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[15]</span></span></span></a>, the headnote of which case reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The granting a certificate of dismissal, under section&nbsp;27. of the 9 Geo. 4. c.31, is a ministerial, and not a judicial act; and a magistrate having heard a charge of assault and dismissed such charge, on either of the grounds stated in that section, is bound to grant a certificate, stating the fact of such dismissal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Such certificate, though not applied for and not drawn up in the presence of the parties, is a good defence, under section&nbsp;28, to an action for the assault.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, on this point, I agree with Haddad J.A., of the Alberta Appellate Division, as to the “effectiveness and convenience afforded by a certificate of dismissal” and with his view that s.&nbsp;743 imposes no limitation as to the time for drawing up the order of dismissal. With respect, I disagree with the opinion of Limerick J.A., expressed in <i>R. v. Myshrall</i><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[16]</span></span></span></a>, that request for an order of dismissal must be made at trial as the magistrate, <i>functus officio, </i>cannot draw up or certify an order of dismissal thereafter. A rule limiting the protection of s.&nbsp;743 to those who request at trial that an order of dismissal be drawn up would work a grave hardship on the many defendants who appear without counsel and are ignorant of s.&nbsp;743 of the <i>Code.</i></span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In some circumstances, it may be difficult to say whether the defendant has, indeed, been “<i>bis vexatus</i>”; for example, where an information has been withdrawn or dismissed on technical grounds, or, the Crown contends, as in the case at bar, where there was no disposition “on the merits”. It will be recalled that the second question upon which leave to appeal was granted raises the issue of whether the information was dealt with “on the merits”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am not at all certain of what is meant by the term “on the merits”, or indeed whether the ter-</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">minology of “on the merits” furthers in any way our understanding of the effect of the dismissal of an information. Section 734 specifically empowers the summary conviction court to dismiss upon non-appearance of the prosecutor. Again we face <i>Cooper </i>and <i>Osborne. </i>Johnson J.A. in the former case held that “on the merits” necessarily meant after a “trial”, <i>i.e. </i>by the terms of s.&nbsp;739, after the court “had heard the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses” and “after considering the matter”. Section 739 reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">When the summary conviction court has heard the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses it shall, after considering the matter, convict the defendant or make an order against him or dismiss the information, as the case may be.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 736(3) reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Where the defendant pleads not guilty or states that he has cause to show why an order should not be made against him, as the case may be, the summary conviction court shall proceed with the trial, and shall take the evidence of witnesses for the prosecutor and the defendant in accordance with the provision of Part XV relating to preliminary inquiries.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 735(1) reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Where the prosecutor and defendant appear, the summary conviction court shall proceed to hold the trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Limerick J.A. in <i>Osborne </i>relied upon s.&nbsp;736(3) and the language there of “proceed with the trial” after the taking of plea, so that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">the trial commences only after the plea has been taken and initiates with the calling of the first witness or the introduction of other evidence. The accused is not in jeopardy until all the evidence of the prosecution has been adduced, the defence has closed its case and the case is ready to go to the jury or Judge for decision. (p. 410)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Yet, one need only point to s.&nbsp;735, prior to any reference to plea, where subs. (1) states: “Where the prosecutor and defendant appear, the summary conviction court shall proceed to hold the trial.”</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 395]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>Blair and Karashowsky, supra, </i>Clement J.A. took a view differing from that expressed in <i>Osborne. </i>Mr.&nbsp;Justice Clement first registered a <i>caveat </i>about the pitfalls of the term “on the merits”, and then added at p.&nbsp;53:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">When the prisoner has pled, the formalities are completed, the case is before the Court, the prisoner is in jeopardy, and what arises thereafter is a matter of the conduct of the trial.</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">In an ordinary court of oyer and terminer, if the defendant appears and pleads, he has an undoubted right to have the matter determined. When the complaint is ripe for hearing, and the defendant is ready to take his trial, if the prosecutor alleges nothing against him, or merely something that is unsubstantial, then the magistrates are bound to find the charge not proved, and to give a certificate accordingly.</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Quashing an order for want of form is different from quashing it merely because the merits are not gone into. If the order is discharged because the respondents do not choose to enter into their case, that is a quashing on the merits.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>R. v. Ross, supra, </i>Bull J.A. at pp. 486-7 speaks to like effect:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">But it is an entirely different situation where, after a trial has been started in the sense that an accused has pleaded and is before the Court, the charge is dismissed whether because there is no evidence adduced or only</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 396]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">insufficient or inadequate evidence adduced by the Crown. I can see no real difference. The charge has not been put aside or taken away; it has been dismissed and the accused, in my view, is entitled to a certificate of acquittal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Returning to <i>Double Jeopardy, </i>Friedland at p.&nbsp;54 states his view unequivocally:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">If a court exercises its discretion not to adjourn or to permit the charge to be withdrawn, the resulting dismissal or acquittal should bar further proceedings. A dismissal in such circumstances should not differ from a dismissal brought about by the prosecutor deliberately offering no evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There follows (pp. 57-59) an illuminating discussion of the origin of the unfortunate phrase “on the merits”. In nineteenth century England, justices were given power to issue “certificates of dismissal” with respect to common assaults and batteries. These certificates served to release the accused “from all further or other Proceedings, Civil or Criminal, for the same Cause”, an extraordinary legislative provision. In a couple of cases, (<i>Tunnicliffe v. Tedd, supra, </i>and <i>Vaughton v. Bradshaw</i><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[20]</span></span></span></a>) the prosecutor chose to drop the criminal proceedings in favour of a civil suit, yet the certificate barred such a suit. Accordingly, the provision was amended in 1861 with the addition of the words ‘“upon the merits”. The full effect of the amendment was made clear in <i>Reed v. Nutt</i><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[21]</span></span></span></a>, where Lord Coleridge C.J. said, p.&nbsp;674, “…the later statute requires a more complete and substantial hearing of the charge than the earlier one did…”. Despite the absence of such language in the <i>Code, </i>the post-1861 cases were relied upon in imposing an “upon the merits” test in decisions like <i>R. v. Commodore Hotel (Windsor) Ltd.</i><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[22]</span></span></span></a>, and <i>Burns v.

The statutory language upon which <i>Reed v. Nutt </i>rested (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 100, s.&nbsp;44) read: “If the justices, upon the <i>hearing </i>of any such case of assault or battery <i>upon the merits</i>…</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 397]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">shall deem the offence not to be proved…”. (Emphasis added.)</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">On a subsequent charge in which the serial number of the saw in question was changed, a plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>was accepted, and it is the acceptance of that plea which forms the subject-matter of this appeal.

We think the accused, once a plea had been entered, was in jeopardy and that if the Crown elected not then to call any evidence, the disposition by acquittal was a disposition on the merits of the case.</span></p>

Arial">[25]</span></span></span></a>, an information was preferred against the appellant for having sold milk which was deficient in natural fat. When the case came on for hearing the magistrate was informed that no certificate of analysis had been served with the summons in pursuance of the applicable legislation, whereupon he dismissed the summons. No evidence of the facts was given. A second summons was then taken out in respect of the same alleged offence. The Court held (Lush J. dissenting) that the appellant had been in peril of being convicted on the first summons and, therefore, entitled to plead <i>autrefois acquit </i>to the second summons. Ridley J. said, p.&nbsp;335:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I think he was in peril and therefore that he was entitled to plead <i>autrefois acquit. </i>The magistrate had jurisdiction unless objection was taken at the proper time to the informality, and unless that objection was taken there was a possibility, and indeed a probability, that the magistrate would proceed to a decision and convict the appellant. The appellant was thus in peril. It is not quite correct to say, although it is rather an attractive phrase, that there must have been an acquittal upon the merits in order that there may be a good plea of <i>autrefois acquit, </i>In whatever way a person obtains an acquittal, whether it be by the verdict of a jury on the merits or by</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="FR">[Page 398]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">some ruling on a point of law without the case going to the jury, he is entitled to protection from further proceedings. Once there is an acquittal he cannot be tried again for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Avory J. had this to say, at p.&nbsp;337:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I agree, but I prefer to rest my judgment upon the one ground that the plea of <i>res judicata </i>or <i>autrefois acquit </i>depends for its validity upon this one question, whether the accused on the former occasion was in peril of being convicted of the same offence. If he was, the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>is good.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">and</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The question whether the one or the other is in peril is to be ascertained by inquiring whether the magistrate had jurisdiction to deal with the offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, a criminal trial commences and an accused is normally in jeopardy from the moment issue is joined before a judge having jurisdiction and the prosecution is called upon to present its case in court. The person accused continues in jeopardy until final determination of the matter by rendering of the verdict.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Should the accused avail himself of the certificate provided for in s.&nbsp;743(1), subs. (2) bars any subsequent proceedings in respect of the same cause, without reference to the events giving rise to the dismissal. In principle, there is no reason why a different situation ought to prevail where the defendant has not obtained the certified copy. Nor, in principle, is it easy to distinguish between the situation where the Crown leads evidence which fails to make out a case for the defendant to answer and the situation where, as here, no evidence is led. So long as the case has proceeded to a verdict and a dismissal, that should be sufficient. See <i>R.&nbsp;v. Ecker and Fry</i><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[26]</span></span></span></a>, at p.&nbsp;3, where Chief Justice Latchford said, in a passage adopted by Taschereau J. in <i>Welch v. R.</i><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[27]</span></span></span></a>, at p.&nbsp;417:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">This Court was of opinion that “in jeopardy twice”—the <i>bis vexari </i>of the legal maxim—has not the meaning of subjection twice to a trial for the same offence except in cases where the first trial has been concluded by an adjudication or judgment declaring the accused acquit-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 399]</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">ted or convicted. Not otherwise could the plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>or <i>autrefois convict </i>prevail.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The term “on the merits” does nothing to further the test for the application of the <i>bis vexari </i>maxim. There is no basis, in the <i>Code </i>or in the common law, for any super-added requirement that there must be a trial “on the merits”. That phrase merely serves to emphasize the general requirement that the previous dismissal must have been made by a court of competent jurisdiction, whose proceedings were free from jurisdictional error and which rendered judgment on the charge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Speaking generally, it is not readily apparent why the Crown should have the right to decline to adduce evidence in support of its charge and then assert the irrelevance of a dismissal consequent thereon, or why the Crown should be enabled to avoid the effect of refusal of an adjournment by declining to lead evidence and laying a fresh information following dismissal of the first charge. It is the intent of the <i>Code </i>that summary conviction matters be disposed of with despatch. No good purpose is served by introducing unwarranted complexities into what are, or should be, simple and straight-forward and expeditious procedures.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
