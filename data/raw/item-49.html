At trial, the defence adduced evidence indicating that the film had been approved and classified by the Censor Board as a restricted adult movie and that it had been previously shown in Alberta to a large audience with no complaint being made to the Board. The evidence further showed that the film had been similarly approved and classified by the other provincial censor boards across the country. The trial judge found the film immoral, indecent and obscene and convicted the appellant. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision. This appeal is to determine whether the trial judge applied the proper test in finding the appellant guilty of presenting an obscene entertainment.</span></p>

To determine "undueness" one of the tests to be applied is whether the accepted standards of tolerance in the contemporary Canadian community, taken as a whole, have been exceeded. In applying the community standard of tolerance what matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see. What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see it. Relevant to that determination is, among other factors, the audience to which the film is targeted since the community may tolerate different things for different groups of people depending on the circumstances. </span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trier of fact must formulate an opinion of what the contemporary Canadian community will tolerate in order to determine "undueness" by the community standards test. The community consensus must be assessed and community level of tolerance objectively determined. While evidence of the community standards of tolerance may well be useful in many cases, it is not essential, for it is the opinion of the trier of fact about the community standards of tolerance which is important. The judge does not have to accept evidence, expert or otherwise, but he cannot reject it without good reason. The trier of fact's personal views regarding the impugned film are irrelevant.</span></p>

He did not direct his mind to the question whether most people would tolerate others seeing the film in question and he failed to consider the fact that the film was restricted to adults only and that only those who chose to see it would be exposed to it. Further, it was incumbent upon him to consider and assess the weight, if any, to be given to the evidence adduced by the defence indicative of community standards of tolerance. He should not have rejected it without explanation.</span></p>

"Undue" refers to the treatment of sex which in some fundamental way dehumanizes the persons portrayed and, as a consequence, the viewers themselves. The question whether there was "undueness" must be determined according to the objective standard of the contemporary Canadian community. What must be ascertained is the degree of exploitation of sex Canadians at any given time will accept in their films. It is therefore not open to the courts under s. 159(8) to characterize a movie as obscene if shown to one constituency but not if shown to another. A movie is either obscene based on a national community standard of tolerance or it is not.</span></p>

Indeed, it is naive to think that a judge, drawing on his own experience alone, can determine the objective standard against which impugned conduct is to be measured. Moreover, it is wrong in principle. It leaves the accused with no way of knowing the case to be met, or the level of acceptability imposed by any particular judge.</span></p>

He did not address his mind to the issue of the significance of the approvals as evidence of the community standard of acceptance. Considering that the business of these boards is to assess films on an ongoing basis for the very purpose of determining their acceptability for viewing by the community, it is difficult to think that a judge would be better informed as to what was acceptable to Canadians across the country. The trial judge, applying an objective test and giving proper consideration to that evidence, could not have reached the result he did. The judge clearly saw his role, not as applying the community standard but as raising it if he personally thought it was too low. In this respect he erred. </span></p>

The film had been given a "Restricted" rating by the Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. A copy of the motion picture was seized by the Edmonton City Police on January 27, 1980, after the public showing on that date and before the scheduled second public showing.

The first was Terrance Yushchyshyn, Director of Operations for the theatres operated by the accused company in the five westerly provinces. His evidence in summary was as follows. Prior to being booked into his theatre in Edmonton, the film, the subject of the present charge, had been shown at two Famous Players' Theatres, one in Edmonton, where it had been seen by 4065 persons and one in Calgary, where it had been seen by 4075 persons. The film was then moved to the Jasper Cinema where it was seen, before seizure, by 555 people, without complaints. In Mr. Yushchyshyn's opinion the impugned film was "very <i>passé</i>", "boring and dull". Other films such as <i>Last Tango in Paris</i>, had far greater emphasis on sexual gratification.</span></p>

The Board views every film seen in Alberta. The Board allowed <i>Dracula Sucks</i> to be shown in the province as a restricted adult movie, no one under the age of eighteen being admitted. The film was approved in the restricted adult category or equivalent by all of the provincial censor boards or classification boards across Canada. Mr. Hooper said that his Board had not made any deletions to the film. Most movies are "pretty extensively cut when we get them". This one had been edited in Toronto. The Board arrives at appropriate classification for a movie consistent with the Board's interpretation of current community standards of acceptance. Compared to other movies he had seen, Mr. Hooper described <i>Dracula Sucks</i> as "pretty forgettable". The Board had received no complaints regarding this particular film. During the preceding year, the Board viewed 750 films and rejected twelve, because it was felt that adult Albertans would generally repudiate them. The basis for the Board's assessment of community standards has shifted during the preceding ten years: now, "it's contemporary, it's modern, it must be Canadian". Mr. Hooper succinctly described <i>Dracula Sucks</i>: "Well, it has nudity in it, it has violence in it, it has simulated sex encounters in it." </span></p>

Those reasons are blunt and impactive. The trial judge, sitting as a jury, was obliged to determine in an objective way what was tolerable in accordance with the contemporary standards of the Canadian community. As a trier of fact he was entitled to draw on his experience in the community. He had to consider the expert evidence but was entitled to reject it and obviously did. In this we are paraphrasing the remarks of Howland, C.J.O., in <i>Regina v. Sudbury News Service</i> 1978 39 C.C.C. (2d) 1 at p. 7.</span></p>

The trial judge found that the only theme of the film "Dracula Sucks", was sex and violence, extreme and explicit. He found no plot. He asked himself what are contemporary community standards and considered all the evidence led. He cautioned himself on the dangers of slipping into subjective standards and concluded that the film did not meet the objective test.

A number of decisions in various jurisdictions had previously concluded that films were "publications" and therefore properly dealt with under s. 159(8) (see <i>R. v.

letter-spacing:-.15pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dechow</i> dealt with an allegation of obscenity with regard to an exhibition of sex stimulators. Using language and reasoning easily extendible to motion pictures, Ritchie J., writing for the majority, held that the objects in question, accompanied as they were by printed instructions for their use, were "publications" within the meaning of that term in s. 159. They were therefore to be judged by the standard laid down in s. 159(8), which was the sole test of obscenity in relation to publications. Chief Justice Laskin, speaking for a minority of the Court, preferred the view that the articles in question were not publications. He was, however, of the opinion that the Court should apply exclusively the test in s. 159(8) in respect of allegations of obscenity whether such allegations are made under s. 159 (which deals with publications) or one of the other sections of the <i>Code</i>, such as s. 163 (under which the charge against Towne Cinema was laid) or s.&nbsp;164. </span></p>

(speaking also for Abbott and Martland JJ.) in <i>Brodie v. The Queen</i>, [1962] S.C.R. 681, the <i>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</i> case. <i>Brodie</i> was the first obscenity appeal to come before this Court following the introduction of s. 159(8) and Judson J.'s explication of this section reveals a very clear awareness of the criticism that had been leveled against the <i>Hicklin</i> test and an intention to avoid its pitfalls in the future. In <i>Hicklin</i> Cockburn C.J. had said:</span></p>

In <i>Brodie</i>, Judson J. expressed the view that by the enactment of s. 159(8) "all the jurisprudence under the <i>Hicklin</i> definition is rendered obsolete" (p. 701) and that the new definition gave the Court "an opportunity to apply tests which have some certainty of meaning and are capable of objective application, which do not so much depend as before upon the idiosyncrasies and sensitivities of the tribunal of fact, whether judge or jury" (p. 702). Henceforth, the standard for obscenity would be an "undue exploitation of sex" and Judson J. proposed two tests which he regarded as capable of objective application to determine such "undueness".</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judson J.'s second test for "undueness" looked to the standards of the community. The concept of "community standards" had previously been applied by courts in Australia and New Zealand as a measure of whether a work exhibited an "undue emphasis" on sex. Judson J. regarded this reading of undue as meaning "what the community regards as excessive" to be preferable to what he saw as the only alternative (at p. 706):</span></p>

Ours is not a perfect society and it is unfortunate but true that the community may tolerate publications that cause harm to members of society and therefore to society as a whole. Even if, at certain times, there is a coincidence between what is not tolerated and what is harmful to society, there is no necessary connection between these two concepts. Thus, a legal definition of "undue" must also encompass publications harmful to members of society and, therefore, to society as a whole.</span></p>

No one should be subject to the degradation and humiliation inherent in publications which link sex with violence, cruelty, and other forms of dehumanizing treatment. It is not likely that at a given moment in a society's history, such publications will be tolerated. See <i>R. v. Doug Rankine Co.</i> (1983), 36 C.R. (3d) 154 (Ont. Co. Ct.) at p. 173; <i>R. v.

The Queen</i>, [1964] S.C.R. 251, adopted <i>in toto</i> the dissenting reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba by Freedman J.A., [1963] 2 C.C.C. 103. In that case, as in this, the allegedly obscene material had no discernible serious purpose or artistic merit. Freedman J.A.'s discussion of whether or not it unduly exploited sex was therefore focussed on its relationship to community standards. Applying Judson J.'s observation in <i>Brodie</i> about the need to test undueness by objective criteria, Freedman J.A. elaborated on several requisite characteristics of the community standards to be applied. He held that the standards must be <i>Canadian</i> standards, not those prevailing elsewhere, and that they must be <i>contemporary</i> standards reflecting the current level of candour with regard to sexual matters not the level of the past. On the question of which contemporary Canadians are to be the touchstone of "community standards" Freedman J.A. said at p. 116:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Those standards are not set by those of lowest taste or interest. Nor are they set exclusively by those of rigid, austere, conservative, or puritan taste and habit of mind. Something approaching a general average of community thinking and feeling has to be discovered. Obviously this is no easy task, for we are seeking a quantity that is elusive. Yet the effort must be made if we are to have a fair objective standard in relation to which a publication can be tested as to whether it is obscene or not. The alternative would mean a subjective approach, with the result dependent upon and varying with the personal tastes and predilections of the particular Judge who happens to be trying the case.</span></p>

It is harm to society from undue exploitation that is aimed at by the section, not simply lapses in propriety or good taste. In <i>R. v. Prairie Schooner News Ltd. and Powers</i> (1970), 1 C.C.C.

I would accept this definition. In the <i>Brodie</i> case Judson J., referred, p. 181, to "standards of acceptance prevailing in the community". In the <i>Great West News</i> case, we referred to contemporary standards of tolerance. I have no doubt, as Dr. Rich testified, and as the Judge agreed, a distinction can be made between private taste and standard of tolerance. It can hardly be questioned that many people would find personally offensive, material which they would permit others to read. Parliament, through its legislation on obscenity, could hardly have wished to proscribe as criminal that which was acceptable or tolerable according to current standards of the Canadian community.</span></p>

I would adopt the following passage of Howland C.J.O. in <i>Sudbury News Service Ltd.</i> (<i>supra</i>) at p. 8:</span></p>

There are some publications which are so blatantly indecent that they would not be tolerable by the Canadian community under any circumstances. Some pictures are offensive to the majority of people to the point that the Canadian community would not tolerate them on a billboard, or on the cover of a magazine, or on a television screen where persons of all ages and sensibilities would be exposed to them, but would be prepared to tolerate them being viewed by persons who wished to view them. Some pictures would not be acceptable by Canadian community standards in a children's bedtime story‑book or primer but would be in a magazine for general distribution. The Canadian community might be prepared to tolerate the exhibition of a motion picture to an adult audience, but would consider the exhibition of the same motion picture to a general audience, which included children, to be an undue exploitation of sex. Similarly, the general distribution of certain magazines to a neighbourhood store accessible to all ages would not be tolerable, whereas the distribution of such magazines to "adult" bookstores to which children under a certain age were not admitted might not be objectionable. The packaging and pricing of a publication may also be relevant in considering whether Canadian community standards have been exceeded. The distribution of magazines in plastic covers marked "adult" in some respects might act as an attraction rather than a deterrent unless the price was high enough to place it beyond the reach of most children.</span></p>

The appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected himself in holding that his assessment of the local community's feeling of "revulsion" was determinative of the Canadian community standard of tolerance, and in thereby employing a subjective and regional rather than objective and national test. According to the appellant the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the film would not be tolerated by the Canadian community in the sense that those who do not wish to view it will not accept or tolerate the fact that others do and will see it.</span></p>

In <i>Brodie</i>, Judson J. makes it clear that the trier of fact is not supposed simply to apply his own subjective standard but rather to assess the community standard. The statement of the trial judge, "I do not feel that I am imposing my own standards completely" seems to imply that he is imposing his own standards primarily and lends support to the submission of the appellant that the test applied was subjective and not objective. In particular, the sentence reading: "Somebody has got to draw the line and I don't know how far community standards are prepared to be stretched before somebody does draw the line on the type of garbage that I saw this morning" suggests that the judge is imposing his own standard‑‑somebody has to draw the line and he is going to be the one to do it.</span></p>

Counsel for the appellant does not contend that censor board approval is a bar to a criminal prosecution. He readily concedes that it is for the courts to decide whether a publication is obscene (<i>Daylight Theatre Co. v. The Queen</i> (<i>supra</i>); <i>R. v. McFall</i> (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 181 (B.C.C.A.)</span></p>

In support of this argument counsel cited several passages on the subject of expert evidence from the dissenting judgment of Laskin J.A., as he then was, in <i>R. v. Cameron</i> (1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 486 (Ont. C.A.) and urged us to accept them as correct statements of the evidentiary requirements in obscenity cases. </span></p>

Under the <i>Hicklin</i> rule expert evidence was in general held to be irrelevant. As Laidlaw J.A. explained in <i>R. v. American News Co.</i> (1957), 118 C.C.C. 152 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 157, since, under the <i>Hicklin</i> test, the <i>gravamen</i> of the offence was a tendency to deprave or corrupt, evidence as to artistic merit‑‑no matter how reliable‑‑was held to be irrelevant to the issue of obscenity. And as for evidence tending to show that the material in question had no tendency to deprave or corrupt, Laidlaw J.A.'s discussion, at p. 161, illustrates that the prevailing rules of evidence held such testimony to be inadmissible opinion evidence going to the very question to be determined by the trier of fact.</span></p>

Such evidence can properly be accorded the status of <u>expert</u> testimony. The state of mind or attitude of a community is as much a fact as the state of one's health: it would seem therefore as proper to admit the opinion of experts on the one subject as on the other.</span></p>

In <i>R. v. Great West News Ltd.</i> (<i>supra</i>), the appellants attempted to impose precisely that obligation on the Crown. It was argued that the Crown must fail because no evidence had been put before the court from which the court could objectively determine prevailing community standards. Counsel submitted that the court must determine from evidence placed before it by the Crown: (i) what is the community standard, that is to say, what is the standard of tolerance of Canadians as a whole to material of the nature of that impugned? (ii) does the material impugned so far transcend that standard as to be branded as criminal? After a review of the cases, and speaking also for Smith C.J.M., I had occasion to say, at pp. 314‑15:</span></p>

I do not find in <i>Brodie</i> or elsewhere in the Commonwealth, any majority opinion that expert evidence of community standards is an essential ingredient to a finding of guilt. If any inference can be drawn from <i>Brodie</i> it is that the Judge must, in the final analysis, endeavour to apply what he, in the light of his experience, regards as contemporary standards of the Canadian community. In so doing he must be at pains to avoid having his decision simply reflect or project his own notions of what is tolerable.</span></p>

To impose on the Crown a positive requirement to adduce expert evidence as to community standards would be unrealistic. Expert evidence is always expensive, sometimes simply not available and frequently unreliable. The American experience‑‑based, to be sure on a somewhat different test for obscenity‑‑has been summarized in <i>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,</i> 413 U.S. 49 (1973) at p. 56, Note 6. Obscenity, it is said, "is not a subject that lends itself to the traditional use of expert testimony...indeed the `expert witness' practices employed in these cases have often made a mockery out of the otherwise sound concept of expert testimony". <i>United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise,</i> 709 F.2d 132 (2d Cir. 1983) at p. 135, a recently reported American obscenity decision, confirms that although the government bears the burden of proving each element of obscenity (including a breach of community standards) to the satisfaction of the trier of fact, expert evidence of community standards is not constitutionally required, and that absent (or even in the face of) such evidence, the impugned materials may "speak for themselves" so as to ground a conviction for obscenity. </span></p>

Indeed, even if it is presented, the trier of fact is not bound to accept it. There is no necessity for the judge or jury to rely on evidence introduced in court as the basis for identifying community standards. Therefore, the trier of fact may determine for himself or herself (or themselves, in cases tried by a jury) the content of the community standard which is to be applied in determining whether the material in issue exceeds that standard. It is an objective test which applies. The test is not based on the level of tolerance of the judge or the jury. It is what the judge or jury believe the national level of tolerance to be.</span></p>

The decision must focus on an objective determination of the community's level of tolerance and whether the publication exceeds such level of tolerance, not the trier of fact's personal views regarding the impugned publication. Thus, the role of an appellate court on an appeal from a determination of the community standard is to ensure that the trier of fact's decision is based on an opinion on the community standard of tolerance, not on his or her opinion about the tastelessness or impropriety of the impugned publication.</span></p>

Nonetheless, I do not consider that there must be evidence, expert or otherwise, which the trier of fact accepts before a particular publication can be determined to violate the community standard. It is the opinion of the trier of fact on the community standard of tolerance with which we are concerned. It ought not to be stated as a matter of law that the trier of fact must have evidence, expert or otherwise, to be able to form an opinion on the community standard of tolerance.</span></p>

In this case, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider and assess the weight, if any, to be given to the evidence, indicative of community standards of tolerance, afforded by the approval of the film by censor boards or classification boards as well as the fact that no complaints had been received by the Board in Alberta although more than 8,500 people had viewed the film. He might, for instance, have considered the following assessment of similar evidence with regard to <i>Last Tango in Paris</i> by Freedman C.J.M. in <i>R. v.

Relevant to that determination are many factors. One is the testimony of the experts, to be judicially assessed and weighed. Another is the circumstance that the film is adult fare only, as it has been given the classification "Restricted Adult", thereby becoming unavailable to persons under 18 years of age. A third is the fact that the film is being shown in New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia, in all of which Provinces it was given clearance by censor boards who made no deletions in it. (The film is of course being shown in many other countries in the world as well.) The record does not disclose a single Province that has banned "Last Tango".

The problem then becomes one of how to identify that contemporary community standard in order to decide whether or not it has been exceeded.</span></p>

This is sometimes referred to as the Canadian standard of tolerance. I take no issue with the word tolerance. In my view there is no difference in meaning between acceptance by the community and tolerance by the community. I do not find it helpful, however, to refine further on that standard by identifying it as the degree of exploitation of sex to which Canadians are prepared to have other Canadians exposed. I think this is a different standard, a much more difficult one to identify and one not mandated by the section. </span></p>

The community standard itself, however, necessarily contains an element of subjectivity since what must be objectified are the subjective views of the entire community as to what degree of exploitation of sex is acceptable. To identify the community standard in terms of the degree of exploitation of sex to which Canadians are prepared to have other Canadians exposed has the effect, however, of introducing an even greater degree of subjectivity into the community standard. I believe this is so because what Canadians consider to be acceptable for other Canadians is likely to depend heavily on which other Canadians they have in mind. The community may feel that the degree of exploitation of sex in a particular film would be unacceptable if the film were shown to an audience of young people or senior citizens but nevertheless feel that it would be acceptable if the film were shown to a university group. In determining this community standard the trier of fact would be forced to speculate not only on what the community considers to be acceptable but on which particular constituency the community has in mind in setting the standard of acceptability.</span></p>

If they do, then the movie is not obscene. If they don't, then the exploitation is "undue" and, if it is a dominant characteristic of the movie, the movie is deemed to be obscene under the section. It is not, in my opinion, open to the courts under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec159subsec8" target="_blank">s. 159(8)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> to characterize a movie as obscene if shown to one constituency but not if shown to another. I do not doubt that it is desirable to regulate the movies that can be shown to different constituencies. A movie which is not obscene within the meaning of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> may still not be desirable viewing material for persons under the age of 18. Such regulation, as will be mentioned later in these reasons, is authorized in various provincial jurisdictions but it is the regulation of material which is not obscene under the <i>Code</i>. I do not think the Court should, by segregating the community into different groups for purposes of ascertaining the standard of tolerance the community would adopt for each group, inject into <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec159subsec8" target="_blank">s. 159(8)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> a series of different tests of obscenity. In my view, a movie is either obscene under the <i>Code</i> based on a national community standard of tolerance or it is not. If it is not, it may still be the subject of provincial regulatory control. </span></p>

I describe it as a "moral" consensus because I agree with the Chief Justice that we are not concerned here with matters of "taste". To use the standard accepted by members of the community for themselves does not, in my view, substitute "taste" for moral acceptability. I think it is incorrect to say that when I am deciding whether or not I myself am prepared to be shown a certain type of movie I am making a decision merely on the basis of <i>taste</i> but when I am deciding whether or not I am prepared to have that same movie shown to others I am making a decision on the basis of <i>tolerance</i>. This, in my view, is a false distinction. In either case tolerance in the sense of moral acceptability is the issue‑‑in the former case moral acceptability to myself and in the latter moral acceptability to others. People may, of course, refuse to patronize certain movies on grounds of taste but this is not at all what we are concerned with under the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>. </i></span></p>

There is nothing wrong in the treatment of sex <i>per se</i> but there may be something wrong in the manner of its treatment. It may be presented brutally, salaciously and in a degrading manner, and would thus be dehumanizing and intolerable not only to the individuals or groups who are victimized by it but to society at large. On the other hand, it may be presented in a way which harms no one in that it depicts nothing more than non‑violent sexual activity in a manner which neither degrades nor dehumanizes any particular individuals or groups. It is this line between the mere portrayal of human sexual acts and the dehumanization of people that must be reflected in the definition of "undueness".</span></p>

By guidelines read into the definition as a matter of interpretation of the word "undue"? By consideration of the presumed social ills sought to be avoided by restrictions on freedom of publication? By statistics showing what people are prepared to look at and what they are not? The courts have said that the test is an objective one and clearly that must be so. But objectivity requires criteria and the courts have not been too successful in evolving them. Yet this is a criminal offence and it is basic to our system of criminal justice that the public know what conduct is criminal and what is not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

I believe it is important to the publishing industry to have some degree of certainty as to when they may be exposing themselves to a criminal charge. The only way to provide that degree of certainty is, in my opinion, to have a uniform community standard test of "undueness" under the <i>Code</i>. With great respect to those who think otherwise, I see nothing in s. 159(8) which would permit something to be obscene under the section when shown to X but not obscene when shown to Y. Moreover, it seems to me that this approach would inevitably lead to problems where a publication targetted to one group by the accused fell into the hands of others.</span></p>

It is implicit in the definition that at some point the exploitation of sex becomes harmful to the public or at least the public believes that to be so. It is therefore necessary for the protection of the public to put limits on the degree of exploitation and, through the application of the community standard test, the public is made the arbiter of what is harmful to it and what is not. The problem is that we know so little of the consequences we are seeking to avoid. Do obscene movies spawn immoral conduct? Do they degrade women? Do they promote violence? The most that can be said, I think, is that the public has concluded that exposure to material which degrades the human dimensions of life to a subhuman or merely physical dimension and thereby contributes to a process of moral desensitization must be harmful in some way. It must therefore be controlled when it gets out of hand, when it becomes "undue".</span></p>

No doubt this question will have to be addressed when the validity of the obscenity provisions of the <i>Code</i> is subjected to attack as an infringement on freedom of speech and the infringement is sought to be justified as reasonable. Suffice it to say, that clearly some fairly basic values are designed to be protected by the obscenity provisions and the community standards test is premised on the assumption that these values are held in common by the contemporary Canadian community.</span></p>

Hicklin </i>(1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, obsolete. In their view it was no longer necessary to show a tendency to corrupt and deprave if the dominant characteristic of the publication was an exploitation of sex which was "undue". The test of "undueness", said Mr. Justice Fauteux at p. 697, was whether the exploitation was shocking and disgusting "having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community...." Mr. Justice Judson agreed at pp. 705‑06 that the standards of acceptance prevailing in the community provided the test of "undueness" for purposes of the definition. The statutory definition, he felt, could not be superimposed upon the <i>Hicklin</i> test without leaving the citizen in the position of not knowing whether he was committing a criminal act or not. </span></p>

The learned justice said he would have judged the magazines by the standards of the community and this Court, in reversing the decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal ([1964] S.C.R. 251), unanimously approved and adopted his reasons.

I have examined them both with care. That they do not qualify as reading matter which I would personally select for myself even in an idle hour is undoubtedly the case. But that does not make them obscene. In this area of the law one must be especially vigilant against erecting personal tastes or prejudices into legal principles. Many persons quite evidently desire to read these magazines, even though I do not. I recognize, of course, that the mere numerical support which a publication is able to attract is not determinative of the issue whether it is obscene or not. Let a publication be sufficiently pornographic and it will be bound to appeal, in the hundreds or thousands, to the prurient, the lascivious, the ignorant, the simple, or even the merely curious. Admitting, therefore, that a large readership is not the test, I must yet add that it is not always an entirely irrelevant factor. For it may have to be taken into account when one seeks to ascertain or identify the standards of the community in these matters. Those standards are not set by those of lowest taste or interest. Nor are they set exclusively by those of rigid, austere, conservative, or puritan taste and habit of mind. Something approaching a general average of community thinking and feeling has to be discovered. Obviously this is no easy task, for we are seeking a quantity that is elusive. Yet the effort must be made if we are to have a fair objective standard in relation to which a publication can be tested as to whether it is obscene or not. The alternative would mean a subjective approach, with the result dependent upon and varying with the personal tastes and predilections of the particular Judge who happens to be trying the case.</span></p>

Times change, and ideas change with them. Compared to the Victorian era this is a liberal age in which we live. One manifestation of it is the relative freedom with which the whole question of sex is discussed. In books, magazines, movies, television, and sometimes even in parlour conversation, various aspects of sex are made the subject of comment, with a candour that in an earlier day would have been regarded as indecent and intolerable. We cannot and should not ignore these present‑day attitudes when we face the question whether Dude and Escapade are obscene according to our criminal law.</span></p>

To strike at a publication which is not clearly obscene may have repercussions and implications beyond what is immediately visible. To suppress the bad is one thing; to suppress the not so bad, or even the possibly good is quite another. Unless it is confined to clear cases, suppression may tend to inhibit those creative impulses and endeavours which ought to be encouraged in a free society. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that there is an onus on the Crown to put evidence before the court on the issue of "undueness". I cannot see how the community standard against which the allegedly obscene matter has to be measured can be identified without it. In <i>R. v. Cameron</i> (1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 486 (Ont.), Laskin J.A. (as he then was) pointed out in dissent that because a judge or jury may be limited in the geographical range of his exposure, which in turn might result in "a limitation of opportunity of appreciation and understanding" of the particular subject‑matter‑‑in that case artists' drawings‑‑expert evidence was indispensable. He said at p.&nbsp;515:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">I think that such evidence would always be necessary to support the case for the Crown as well as to support the defence, especially where, as here, pictures by artists of repute are seized from a reputable gallery. Holding this view, I cannot but be surprised that the Crown in the case at bar produced no expert evidence and relied on the pictures themselves to convey obscenity to the Magistrate. Of course, that ultimate issue was for him, but even the most knowledgeable adjudicator should hesitate to rely on his own taste, his subjective appreciation, to condemn art. He does not advance the situation by invoking his right to apply the law and satisfying it by a formulary advertence to the factors which must be canvassed in order to register a conviction.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laskin J.A. was, of course, speaking of expert evidence in the context of that case but it seems to me that the point is well made with respect to non‑expert evidence as well. Having regard to the fact that the onus is on the Crown to establish obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems to me that the onus is on it to establish both what the community standard of acceptability is and that the accused has gone beyond it. The accused may counter the Crown's evidence of the community standard with evidence of its own and the judge may reach his decision on the evidence in the usual way. In my view it is naive to think that a judge, drawing on his own experience alone, can determine the objective standard against which impugned conduct is to be measured. As Borins Co. Ct. J. said in <i>R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (supra)</i> the legislature cannot credibly expect a trier of fact to have his finger on the "pornographic pulse of the nation". Moreover, it is wrong in principle. It leaves the accused with no way of knowing the case it has to meet, at what level of acceptability the line will be drawn by any particular judge. There is no certainty. It is the length of the Chancellor's foot imported into the criminal law. </span></p>

The trial judge made "a formulary advertence to the factors that had to be canvassed". He indicated that he knew that the test of "undueness" was an objective one, that he had to decide whether or not the film exceeded the standard of acceptability to the community as a whole but he then proceeded to attribute the sense of revulsion which he experienced on viewing the film to the community as a whole. He gave no indication of the basis on which he felt able to make that leap and there is no suggestion that he took into consideration the evidence of censor board approval which was before him. That evidence was not contested and, having regard to the statutory purpose for which these boards were created, I think it was relevant evidence and evidence which he was obliged to consider.</span></p>

The boards are not only empowered to approve or disapprove films <i>in toto</i>. In some provinces the legislation also authorizes the boards to "remove by cutting or otherwise" parts of films. Most provinces have a film classification system, the classes, generally speaking, being "general", "adult" and "restricted".</span></p>

It is hard to think that a judge, or even a jury, sitting in or drawn from a local area would be better informed as to what was acceptable to Canadians across the country. Moreover, in this case at least, the boards' assessments disclose a remarkable degree of uniformity. I do not see how the learned trial judge, applying an objective test and giving proper consideration to that evidence, could have reached the result he did. I believe it is clear from his reasons that he saw his role, not as applying the community standard, but as raising the standard if he personally thought it was too low. I think he was clearly in error in this regard. </span></p>

At present the trier of fact in an obscenity case can be faced with the unenviable task of deciding the level of tolerance of a community of 24 million people on the basis of nothing more than his or her own personal experience. In effect, what the trier of fact does in the absence of evidence is attribute by inference his or her own perception to the entire Canadian community. I would think that requiring the trier of fact to make the determination on the basis of evidence adduced would render the task easier rather than more difficult. It would also, in my view, inspire greater public confidence in the result. Moreover, it might well have the very desirable effect of enhancing uniformity in the application of the law of obscenity since evidence of community standards which is relevant to one prosecution will commonly be relevant to others.</span></p>
