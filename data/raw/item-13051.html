 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that the purpose of the abandonment offence is the protection of children from risk even when no harm occurs.&nbsp; Viewed in the light of the broad scope of potential liability under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec218" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;218<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, the requirement for subjective fault serves an important purpose of ensuring that the reach of the criminal law does not extend too far.&nbsp; While the conduct and people that fall within s.&nbsp;218 are broadly defined, the requirement for subjective fault ensures that only those with a guilty mind are punished.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words “abandon”, “expose” and “wilful” all suggest a subjective fault requirement.&nbsp; The first two of these words involve more than just leaving a child alone or failing to take care of it: they denote awareness of the risk involved and, as defined in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec214" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;214<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, they suggest a requirement for knowledge of the consequences flowing from the prohibited acts of abandonment or exposure. &nbsp;As for the word “wilful”, it is used only in the non‑exhaustive definition of the words “abandon” and “expose” in relation to omissions, and a wilful omission is the antithesis of a crime involving a mere failure to act in accordance with some minimum level of behaviour.&nbsp; Likewise, the use of the word “likely” in both ss.&nbsp;214 and 218 does not suggest an objective fault requirement given that it is simply aimed at criminalizing the creation of risk.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, what is absent from the text of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec218" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;218<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and the broader scheme in which it appears strongly suggest that subjective fault is required.&nbsp; The text of the child abandonment provision does not contain any of the language typically employed by Parliament when it intends to create an offence of objective fault.&nbsp; The prohibition applies to everyone, not just to a particular group engaged in a regulated activity or standing in a particular, defined relationship with the alleged victim.&nbsp; Nothing in the text suggests an intention to impose a minimum and uniform standard of care.&nbsp; There are no references in the text to “dangerous”, “careless” or “reasonable” conduct or any requirement to take “reasonable precautions”.&nbsp; There is no predicate offence and no actual harm is required by the provision, and it does not create, define or impose a duty to do anything other than in the sense that all criminal offences could be considered to create a duty not to commit them.&nbsp; While failure to perform a duty imposed by law on persons in particular relationships is the essence of the necessaries of life offence created by s.&nbsp;215, this is not at all the case with respect to the child abandonment offence under s.&nbsp;218.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The text, context and purpose of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec218" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;218<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> show that subjective fault is required. It follows that the trial judge did not err in acquitting the respondent on the basis that this subjective fault requirement had not been proved. &nbsp;The Court of Appeal was correct to uphold the acquittal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> Rothstein and Moldaver&nbsp;JJ.: Section&nbsp;218 is child protection legislation.&nbsp; It targets three limited classes of people faced with a situation where a child under 10 is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent injury.&nbsp; A common sense approach dictates that the offence is duty‑based and that penal negligence is the level of fault required to establish guilt as regards the proscribed consequences.&nbsp; Further support for this view is found in a review of the provision’s language, its placement in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, relevant scholarly opinion, its legislative evolution and history and the gravity and social stigma associated with the offence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once it is accepted that in enacting s.&nbsp;218 Parliament intended to guard against dangerous conduct that any reasonable person would foresee is likely to endanger a child’s life or expose it to permanent injury, common sense suggests that Parliament would not provide accused persons with a host of defences based on their individual characteristics.&nbsp; Doing so would effectively defeat the provision’s purpose of imposing a societal minimum standard of conduct, since crimes of subjective fault require an assessment of personal characteristics to the extent that they tend to prove or disprove an element of the offence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recognition that s.&nbsp;218 sweeps within its ambit persons who are already duty‑bound to protect a child leads to the central difficulty with holding that s. 218 is, in its entirety, a subjective <i>mens rea </i>offence.&nbsp; If the great bulk of people to whom the provision applies have a pre‑existing and ongoing legal duty to take charge of children who fall below the age of 10, it hardly seems reasonable that they should be judged against a subjective <i>mens rea</i> standard when the very same people who run afoul of the duty‑based provision next door (s.&nbsp;215 (failure to provide necessaries)) are judged on a penal negligence standard in light of this Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Naglik</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122.&nbsp; The result would be a double standard — an objective standard under s. 215 and a subjective standard under s.&nbsp;218 — for provisions that serve similar, if not identical, purposes.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp;218 can be read purposefully and harmoniously, such that it applies only to persons who are cloaked with a duty, whether pre‑existing and ongoing or situational, to protect a particular child under the age of 10 from death or permanent injury, all of whom<i> </i>are properly subject to an objective standard with respect to the consequences element of s.&nbsp;218.&nbsp; The s.&nbsp;214 definition should be restricted in scope as applying only to persons falling into the following three categories: (1)&nbsp;those with a pre‑existing and ongoing legal duty to the child; (2)&nbsp;those who come to the aid of the child who is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent injury, and; (3)&nbsp;those who actually place the child in that situation.&nbsp; Interpreting the scope of s.&nbsp;218 in this way goes a long way toward addressing concerns about the broad scope of potential liability under the provision.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp;218 finds its place in Part VIII of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> under the heading “Duties Tending to Preservation of Life”.&nbsp; It is one of two offences located under that heading — the other being s.&nbsp;215.&nbsp; This provides some indication that Parliament intended that s.&nbsp;218 be construed as a duty‑based offence.&nbsp; It seems anomalous that Parliament would insert a non‑duty‑based offence into a thicket of duty‑related provisions.&nbsp; The scenario becomes even more remarkable when one appreciates that s. 218 is concerned with inherently dangerous conduct that places or is likely to place the lives and safety of helpless young children at risk. &nbsp;This is the very type of situation which requires a societal minimum standard of conduct and calls out for a standard of fault based on objective foreseeability.&nbsp; Likewise, the plain language of s.&nbsp;218 — supported by the place of situational duties in Canadian criminal law, the offence’s placement among other duty‑based provisions in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and the scholarship on s.&nbsp;218 — leads to the conclusion that the offence of child abandonment is duty‑based.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legislative history of s.&nbsp;218 further supports the conclusion that the fault element for s.&nbsp;218 is penal negligence.&nbsp; The provision has never included words of subjective intention, as confirmed by the early English interpretation of the offence.&nbsp; Furthermore, neither the social stigma associated with it nor the gravity of the offence of child abandonment require it to be treated differently than its sister provision s.&nbsp;215 (failure to provide necessaries), where penal negligence was found to be the requisite fault element.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under a penal negligence standard, a mistake of fact that is both honest and reasonable affords a complete defence.&nbsp; Thus, an objective <i>mens rea</i> standard does not punish the morally blameless.&nbsp; In the present circumstances, the trial judge found that the respondent honestly believed that her child was dead at birth and that this belief was objectively reasonable.&nbsp; As such, she was entitled to be acquitted based on the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact.</p>

(The full text of the provision is found in the Appendix.) The question on appeal concerns the fault element of the offence: Is the fault element to be assessed subjectively or objectively?&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue arises out of a heart-rending story which, fortunately, has a happy ending. The respondent, not previously knowing that she was pregnant, gave birth to a baby boy while using the toilet in a Wal-Mart store.&nbsp; Thinking the child was dead, she cleaned up as best she could and left, leaving the child in the toilet. The child was in fact alive, was quickly attended to by others and, by all reports, is now a healthy little boy. The trial judge believed the respondent’s claim that she was not aware of her pregnancy until the child appeared and that she believed the child was dead when she left him. Thus, whether the fault element is assessed according to what the respondent actually knew or by what a reasonable person would have known and done is an important issue in this case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general terms, when a fault element is assessed subjectively, the focus is on what the accused actually knew: Did the accused know that abandoning the child would put the child’s life or health at risk? If, as the respondent believed, the child was dead when she abandoned him, she would not know that her abandonment of him risked putting his life or health at risk. Again to speak generally, when assessed objectively, the focus is not on what the accused actually knew, but on whether a reasonable person in those circumstances would have seen the risk and whether the accused’s conduct is a marked departure from what a reasonable person would have done. If a court were persuaded that a reasonable person would have seen the risk of abandoning the child in these circumstances and concluded that the accused’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of a reasonable person, the fault element would be established even though the accused in fact did not see the risk.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that the issue for decision is this:</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec218" target="_blank">s. 218<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> require proof that the accused knew that the acts of alleged abandonment or exposure of a child were such that the abandoned child’s life was or was likely to be endangered or his or her health permanently injured, as the respondent contends? Or, as the appellant Crown contends, is the fault element established by proof that the accused’s conduct constituted a marked departure from that expected of a reasonable person in the same circumstances and that the risk to the child’s life or health would have been a foreseeable result by such a person?</p>

The customers alerted the store staff, but when an assistant manager asked the young woman if she was all right, she responded from inside the stall that she was fine.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, a customer reported that she had discovered a baby’s arm sticking out of the toilet bowl of the stall where the young woman had been. Other customers had seen the baby by that point, but all of them thought it was dead. When the store manager went into the bathroom to see what was happening, he observed that the baby’s leg had started twitching. He pulled the baby out of the toilet. An emergency response team was called and the baby, A.J.H., was transported to the hospital where he was successfully resuscitated and found to be completely healthy.</p>

When contacted by police, she cooperated fully and confirmed that she was the mother of the child. She was charged with unlawfully abandoning a child under the age of 10 years and thereby endangering his life contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec218" target="_blank">s. 218<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

She was 22 years of age by that time and was living with her boyfriend and their baby, S.K. Prior to the birth of A.J.H., she had been gaining weight and so she had taken three home pregnancy tests, all of which were negative. She did not believe she was pregnant because she had been getting her period every month prior to the birth. When she arrived at the Wal-Mart store, she was not feeling well and so she went to the bathroom, where she gave birth a minute or two later. She was surprised by the birth. She did not try to pick the baby up because it was all blue and she thought it was dead. She did not respond to offers for help or tell anyone what had happened because she was afraid. She tried to clean up the blood on the floor and then returned to her friend’s car.</p>

When she found out the baby was alive, she was eager to see him. He now lives with the respondent’s mother and the respondent visits him almost every day. A.D.H. testified that it took her five or six months to realize that she was pregnant with her second child, S.K.</p>

He therefore expressed the issue he had to decide as follows: “. . . whether the accused . . . intended to abandon the child, A.J.H., or did so recklessly with full knowledge of the facts and circumstances or was wilfully blind in respect to them” (para. 15).</p>

The accused had been credible in her testimony. She had not known she was pregnant and truly believed she had delivered a dead child. Her fear and confusion explained her subsequent behaviour. The trial judge also relied on the evidence of Dr. Simpson, who testified that, “[u]nder these circumstances of an unknown pregnancy and a premature, precipitous birth, it is understandable that the accused thought the child was not alive and that she would be scared or panicked, not request help and immediately leave the scene of the birth” (para. 24). Thus, the trial judge found the respondent not guilty and dismissed the charge (para. 26).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, a penal negligence standard means that the Crown must prove two things to establish the fault element:&nbsp; first, that the risk to the child resulting from the respondent’s acts would have been foreseeable by a reasonable person in the same circumstances and, second, that her conduct was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonable person in those circumstances. Penal negligence is the fault element that applies to the offence of failing to provide a child with the necessaries of life under s. 215 of the <i>Code</i> and the Crown submits that the same standard of fault should apply here.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, a subjective standard means, in the context of an offence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec218" target="_blank">s. 218<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, that the fault element requires proof at least of recklessness, in other words that the accused persisted in a course of conduct knowing of the risk which it created.&nbsp; Subjective fault, of course, may also refer to other states of mind. It includes <i>intention</i> to bring about certain consequences; actual <i>knowledge</i> that the consequences will occur; or <i>wilful blindness</i> <span class="st"><span style="color:#222222">—</span></span> that is, knowledge of the need to inquire as to the consequences and deliberate failure to do so. But here, the element of risk (“is likely to”) is part of the definition of the prohibited consequences: the prohibited consequences under s. 218 are that the child’s life “is or is likely to be” endangered or its health “is or is likely to be” permanently injured.&nbsp; It is because the definition of the offence incorporates the notion of risk to life or health that a subjective fault element would require the Crown to show at least recklessness, that is, that the accused actually knew of the risk to the child’s life or health. (Wilful blindness would also suffice, but was not argued in this case. I also note that self-induced intoxication is not relevant here and was not argued. I do not find it either necessary or desirable to speculate about the various issues that would arise if it were raised in the context of this general intent offence. Simply by way of example, one would have to consider among other things issues such as whether the <i>ratio</i> of <i>R. v. Daviault</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 63, applies, whether its application would or should be any different depending on whether the offence requires subjective or objective fault and whether the child abandonment offence falls within the exclusion from the self-induced intoxication defence set out in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec33.1subsec3" target="_blank">s. 33.1(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>relating to offences that include as an element any interference or threat of interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another person.) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

L.M.</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 5284 (QL) (Ct. J.), at para. 49; <i>R. v. C.C.D.</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 4875 (QL) (Ct. J. (Prov. Div.)), at paras. 24-30; <i>R. v. Reedy (No. 2) </i>(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 104 (Ont. D.C.J.C.C.), at pp. 106-8. Others have either applied an objective standard or been unclear about the standard: <i>R. v. McIntosh</i>, [2008] O.J. No. 5742 (QL) (Ct. J.), at paras. 32-33; <i>R. v. Bokane-Haraszt</i>, 2007 ONCJ 228 (CanLII), at paras. 25-26; <i>R. v. Christiansen</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 5733 (QL) (Ct. J. (Prov. Div.)), at paras. 8 and 18-19; <i>R. v. R. (J.)</i>, 2000 CarswellOnt 5325 (Ct. J.).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that existing case law does not settle the question, our task is to “discern the intent of Parliament, having regard to the purpose of the section and the applicable principles of statutory construction”: <i>R. v. Gosset</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 76, at p. 89. We must, therefore, read the words of the statute in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the statute, its objective and the intention of Parliament: <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at p. 41 (quoting E. Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i> (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Statutory Interpretation and Fault Requirements</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Discerning parliamentary intent in relation to the fault element of crimes is often not an easy task.&nbsp; Offences that have long been held to have subjective fault requirements do not expressly say so and even when Parliament decides to expressly set out fault requirements, it does not use language consistently:&nbsp; M. Manning and P. Sankoff, <i>Manning, Mewett &amp; Sankoff:</i> <i>Criminal Law</i> (4th ed. 2009), at pp. 148-49.&nbsp; As a result, the courts must, and often do, infer the fault element: see, e.g., <i>&nbsp;Pappajohn v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, <i>per</i> Dickson J. (as he then was), at p. 146; <i>Sweet v. Parsley</i>, [1970] A.C. 132 (H.L.), <i>per</i> Lord Reid, at p. 148; K. Roach, <i>Criminal Law</i> (5th<sup> </sup>ed.&nbsp; 2012), at pp. 163-64.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this is such a case.&nbsp; The text of the provision does not expressly set out a fault requirement, but the text read in light of its full context supports the conclusion that subjective fault is required.&nbsp; I will begin my analysis by touching on an important presumption of parliamentary intent that applies here and then turn to the purpose, text and scheme of the provision.&nbsp; In the course of that analysis, I will explain why, in my opinion, the Crown’s position that this is an offence of penal negligence must be rejected.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Broader Context</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will review three elements of the broader context of the child abandonment provision: the presumption of legislative intent in favour of subjective fault, the provision’s legislative evolution and finally its purpose.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="text-indent:58.5pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Presumed Legislative Intent</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An important part of the context in which we must interpret s. 218 is the presumption that Parliament intends crimes to have a subjective fault element.&nbsp; The Court has stated and relied on this interpretative principle on many occasions:&nbsp; see, e.g., <i>Watts v. The Queen</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 505, at p. 511; <i>R. v. Rees</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 640, at p. 652; <i>Beaver v. The Queen</i>, [1957] S.C.R. 531, at pp. 542-43; <i>R. v. Sault Ste. Marie</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1303 and 1309-10;&nbsp; <i>R. v. Prue</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 547, at pp. 551 and 553; <i>R. v. Bernard</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, at p. 871; <i>R. v. Martineau</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 645; <i>R. v. Théroux</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5, at p. 18;&nbsp; <i>R. v. Lucas</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 64. Perhaps the classic statement is that of Dickson J. (as he then was) for the Court in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">In the case of true crimes there is a presumption that a person should not be held liable for the wrongfulness of his act if that act is without <i>mens rea . . . . </i></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="text-indent:13.7pt">&nbsp;. . . Where the offence is criminal, the Crown must establish a mental element, namely, that the accused who committed the prohibited act did so intentionally or recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the offence, or with wilful blindness toward them. Mere negligence is excluded from the concept of the mental element required for conviction. Within the context of a criminal prosecution a person who fails to make such enquiries as a reasonable and prudent person would make, or who fails to know facts he should have known, is innocent in the eyes of the law. [Citations omitted; pp. 1303 and 1309-10.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding these many statements, the Crown in effect submits that there is no such presumption of legislative intent because it has not always been applied. The Crown notes that there are many offences in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> that do not require subjective fault and further that there is no absolute rule requiring complete symmetry between the fault element and the prohibited consequences of the offence. In my view, however, these points do not negate the existence of the presumption of legislative intent. They show merely that the presumption does not invariably determine the outcome of a full contextual and purposive interpretation of a particular provision.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Presumptions of legislative intent are not self-applying rules. They are instead principles of interpretation. They do not, on their own, prescribe the outcome of interpretation, but rather set out broad principles that ought to inform it. As Professor Sullivan has observed, presumptions of legislative intent, such as this one, serve as a way in which the courts recognize and incorporate important values into the legal context in which legislation is drafted and should be interpreted.&nbsp; These values both inform judicial understanding of legislation and play an important role in assessing competing interpretations: R. Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i> (4th<sup> </sup>ed. 2002), at p. 365.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Professor Côté has described how these presumptions may inform the legal context in which legislation is drafted.&nbsp; He put it this way:&nbsp; “In some sense, presumptions of intent form part of the enactment’s context, as they reflect ideas which can be assumed to have been both present in the mind of the legislature and sufficiently current as to render their explicit mention unnecessary”: P.-A. Côté, in collaboration with S. Beaulac and M. Devinat, <i>The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</i> (4th ed. 2011), at p. 470; see also R. Cross, <i>Statutory Interpretation</i> (3rd<sup> </sup>ed. 1995), by J. Bell and G. Engle, at pp. 165-67, and K. Roach, “Common Law Bills of Rights as Dialogue Between Courts and Legislatures” (2005), 55 <i>U.T.L.J.</i> 733. Parliament must be understood to know that this presumption will likely be applied unless some contrary intention is evident in the legislation.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the role of the presumption of subjective fault in assessing competing interpretations, it sets out an important value underlying our criminal law. It has been aptly termed one of the “presumptive principles of criminal justice”: <i>R. v. Beatty</i>, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, <i>per</i> Charron J., at paras. 22-23. While the presumption must <span class="st"><span style="color:#222222">—</span></span> and often does <span class="st"><span style="color:#222222">—</span></span> give way to clear expressions of a different legislative intent, it nonetheless incorporates an important value in our criminal law, that the morally innocent should not be punished. This has perhaps never been better expressed than it was by Dickson J. in <i>Pappajohn</i>, at pp. 138-39:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">There rests now, at the foundation of our system of criminal justice, the precept that a man cannot be adjudged guilty and subjected to punishment, unless the commission of the crime was voluntarily directed by a willing mind. . . .&nbsp; Parliament can, of course, by express words, create criminal offences for which a guilty intention is not an essential ingredient.&nbsp; Equally, <i>mens rea</i> is not requisite in a wide category of statutory offences which are concerned with public welfare, health and safety.&nbsp; Subject to these exceptions, <i>mens rea</i>, consisting of some positive states of mind, such as evil intention, or knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, or reckless disregard of consequences, must be proved by the prosecution.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed in this way, the presumption of subjective fault is not an outdated rule of construction which is at odds with the modern approach to statutory interpretation repeatedly endorsed by the Court. On the contrary, the presumption forms part of the context which the modern approach requires to be considered.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I will explain, there is nothing in the text or context of the child abandonment offence to suggest that Parliament intended to depart from requiring subjective fault. In fact, the text, scheme and purpose of the provision support the view that subjective fault is required. To the extent that Parliament’s intent is unclear, the presumption of subjective fault ought to have its full operation in this case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-81.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Legislative Evolution</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Legislative evolution and history may often be important parts of the context within which to conduct the modern approach to statutory interpretation: <i>Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, 2011 SCC 53, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 471, at para. 43. The Crown has been diligent in providing us with a detailed picture of the English origins and Canadian evolution of what is now s. 218.&nbsp; I will touch on this only briefly, however, because as I see it, this information sheds little real light on the issue at hand.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems that from the beginning, there were two strands of prohibitions, one addressing abandoning or exposing a child to risk to its life or health and the other in relation to the breach of a duty by people in certain relationships to provide the necessaries of life.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The origin of the abandonment offence appears to be in the English<i> The Offences against the Person Act,</i> <i>1861</i>, 24 &amp; 25 Vict., c. 100, s. 27, which created the misdemeanor of unlawfully abandoning or exposing any child under the age of two “whereby the life of such child shall be endangered, or the health of such child shall have been or shall be likely to be permanently injured”. The early case law is unclear as to whether subjective or objective fault was required although there is some support for the view that subjective fault is required:&nbsp; see, e.g., <i>R. v. White</i> (1871), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 311, <i>per</i> Bovill C.J., at p. 313, and <i>per</i> Blackburn J., at p. 314.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The necessaries offence appears to have its origins in the English<i> The Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868</i>, 31 &amp; 32 Vict., c. 122.&nbsp; Section 37 of that Act made it an offence for any parent to “wilfully neglect to provide adequate food, clothing, medical aid, or lodging for his child, being in his custody, under the age of fourteen years, whereby the health of such child shall have been or shall be likely to be seriously injured”<a name="_Toc343554203">.&nbsp; The fault element for this offence appears to have been objective: <i>R. v. Downes</i> (1875), 1 Q.B.D. 25</a>, <i>per</i> Bramwell B., at p. 30.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two offences appear to have come closer together in England with the enactment of s. 1 of the <i>Prevention of Cruelty to, and Protection of, Children Act, 1889</i>, 52 &amp; 53 Vict., c. 44, a provision that replaced s. 37 of <i>The</i> <i>Poor Law Amendment Act,</i> <i>1868</i>. (The latter provision was repealed by s. 18 of the 1889 Act.) Section 1 made it a misdemeanor for anyone over 16 who had the custody, control, or charge of a boy under 14 or a girl under 16 to “wilfully” ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose such child in a manner likely to cause such child unnecessary suffering or injury to its health. Again, the fault element is not very clear. In <i>R. v. Senior</i>, [1899] 1 Q.B. 283, the court approved jury instructions that seemed to describe both an objective and a subjective requirement.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[35]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Canada, the abandonment offence and the necessaries of life offence have been kept distinct. The child abandonment offence was first enacted in 1869: <i>An Act respecting Offences against the Person</i>, S.C. 1869, c. 20, s. 26.&nbsp; The offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life was found in s. 25 of the same Act, and applied to individuals who were “legally liable” towards others.&nbsp; From 1869 to 1892, the child abandonment offence did not include any reference to duty: <i>An Act respecting Offences against the Person</i> (1869), s. 26; <i>An Act respecting Offences against the Person</i>, R.S.C. 1886, c. 162, s. 20. Thus, the provision’s early legislative evolution shows clearly that it was not conceived of as a duty-based offence, and suggests that a subjective intent was required.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1892, both offences were included in the first <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> (<i>The Criminal Code,</i> <i>1892</i>, S.C. 1892, c. 29). The abandonment offence was found in s. 216 while the necessaries offence was found in ss. 209 to 211. The abandonment offence was then similar to the current provision.&nbsp; It applied, however, only to children under two and required actual danger to life or permanent injury to health as opposed to the risk of those things occurring as under the current provision.&nbsp; A non-exhaustive definition of “abandon” and “expose” was added in 1892. For the first time, a reference to duty was added, but only in the context of omissions. The definition provided that “abandon” and “expose” included “a wilful omission to take charge of the child on the part of a person legally bound to do so”.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The non-exhaustive definition added in 1892 also included “any mode of dealing with [the child] <u>calculated</u> to leave it exposed to risk without protection”.&nbsp; While I would not attach much weight to the use of the word “calculated”, I note that, if anything, it suggests a subjective fault requirement.&nbsp; This is consistent with the fact that the English case of <i>White</i>, mentioned earlier, appears to have required subjective fault for the English equivalent of the abandonment offence. In 1954, the words “calculated to” were replaced by “likely to” in the non-exhaustive definition so that the provision read as it does today: <i>Criminal Code</i>, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 185. I would not attach much weight to this amendment. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (2nd ed. 1989) suggests that, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, “calculated to” and “likely to” could be used as synonyms. In any event, both “calculated to” and “likely to” are consistent with legislative intent to require subjective fault, albeit “calculated to” could be viewed as requiring specific intent, while “likely to” suggests that general intent is required.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All things considered, my view is that the legislative evolution of the child abandonment offence is, if anything, more supportive than not of the view that subjective fault is required.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="text-indent:58.5pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Purpose and Breadth of the Offence</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that the purpose of the abandonment offence is the protection of children from risk even when no harm occurs.&nbsp; Prior to the enactment of the offence of child abandonment in 1861, the offence required actual harm: <i>R. v. Renshaw</i> (1847), 2 Cox C.C. 285; <i>R. v. Hogan</i> (1851), 2 Den. 277. The new crime of child abandonment filled a perceived gap by punishing those who placed children in positions of risk: <i>R. v. Falkingham </i>(1870), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 222; <i>White</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[40]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that the scope of potential liability under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec218" target="_blank">s. 218<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is very broad, encompassing a wide range of persons and conduct. Liability is not restricted to those who are related to the child, or who have any duties in relation to the child or even to those who are in charge of the child at the time. In addition, a very wide range of conduct falls within the words “abandon” and “expose”.

There are three main points which emerge from a careful study of the text and scheme of these provisions.&nbsp; First, the words “abandon”, “expose” and “wilful” suggest a subjective fault requirement.&nbsp; Second, the use of the word “likely” in this context does not suggest an objective fault requirement. Third, what is absent from the text of s. 218&nbsp; of the <i>Code </i>and the broader scheme in which it appears strongly suggest that subjective fault is required.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-81.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>“Abandon”, “Expose” and “Wilful” Suggest Subjective Fault</u></p>

Both words suggest actions taken with knowledge of their consequences. The <i>Oxford Dictionary of English </i>(2nd ed. rev. 2005),<i> </i>for example, defines “abandon” as “cease to support or look after (someone); desert”.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same dictionary defines “expose” (in the sense of “expose someone to”) as “cause someone to be vulnerable or at risk” or “leave (a child) in the open to die”.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The definition of “desert” is also helpful: “[A]bandon (a person, cause, or organization) in a way considered disloyal or treacherous . . . .”</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[46]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Richards J.A. that the words “abandon” and “expose” on their face, and standing alone, are indicative of subjective fault: C.A., at para. 59. They involve more than just leaving a child alone or failing to take care of it: they denote awareness of the risk involved. This view is also perfectly consistent with the statutory non-exhaustive definition of “abandon” or “expose” in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec214" target="_blank">s. 214<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>which, as noted earlier, suggests a requirement for knowledge of the consequences flowing from the prohibited acts of abandonment or exposure.&nbsp; This is also reflected in the jurisprudence.&nbsp; As noted in <i>L.M.</i>, abandon means “leaving the child to its fate” which suggests an act accompanied by knowledge of or recklessness as to the consequences: paras. 28 and 47; see also, e.g., <i>R. v. Boulden</i> (1957), 41 Cr. App. R. 105, at p. 110; <i>Re Davis</i> (1909), 18 O.L.R. 384, at p. 387.&nbsp; This is one of the factors that led the court in <i>Reedy (No. 2)</i>, to imply a subjective fault requirement (p. 107).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown, in support of its position that the fault element is objective, argued that the non-exhaustive definition of “abandon” and “expose” included in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> in 1892 (now in s. 214) likely came from the English decisions of <i>Falkingham</i> and<i> White</i>. While those cases may well be the origin of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>definition, this does not advance the Crown’s position.&nbsp; In both cases, there was evidence of subjective fault. In <i>White</i>, there was clear evidence that the accused intentionally and knowingly abandoned and exposed the child and was aware of the risk. In <i>Falkingham</i>, there was evidence of at least recklessness or wilful blindness: a mother, with the knowledge and connivance of another woman who was also charged with child abandonment, had put her child in a hamper and sent it by train to the child’s father without indicating to the railway employees that a child was in the package.&nbsp; The accused had been cautious in “packaging” the child, the mother indicated to the railway clerk to be very careful with it and wrote on the hamper “with care, to be delivered immediately” (p. 223). This indicated awareness of the risk.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What emerges from both the ordinary meaning and the non-exhaustive statutory definition of the words “abandon” and “expose” is the notion of awareness of or recklessness in relation to risk.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That brings me to the word “wilful” found in the s. 214 definition of the terms “abandon” and “expose”.&nbsp; Richards J.A. for the majority of the Court of Appeal placed considerable weight on s. 214’s use of the word “wilful” in concluding that subjective fault was required. The word “wilful” is often (although not always) a strong indication that intention is required: see, e.g., the discussion in <i>R. v. Buzzanga </i>(1979), 25 O.R. (2d) 705 (C.A.), at pp. 715-17; <i>R. v. L.B.</i>,<i> </i>&nbsp;2011 ONCA 153, 274 O.A.C. 365, at paras. 108-9, leave to appeal refused, [2011] 3 S.C.R. x;&nbsp; <i>Manning, Mewett &amp; Sankoff: Criminal Law</i>, at pp. 149-50. While the word is used here only in the non-exhaustive definition of the words “abandon” and “expose” and only in relation to omissions, I agree with Richards J.A. that a wilful omission is the antithesis of a crime involving a mere failure to act in accordance with some minimum level of behaviour. If Parliament had meant to include in the terms “abandon” and “expose” situations in which there is no more than a failure to meet a standard of reasonable conduct, it would not make sense to require that omissions to observe that standard would have to be “wilful”:&nbsp; C.A., at paras. 66-67.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="text-indent:40.5pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Word “Likely” Does Not Suggest Objective Fault</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[50]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ottenbreit J.A., in deciding that only objective fault was required, placed considerable weight on the use of the word “likely” in the non-exhaustive definition of the terms “abandon” or “expose” in s. 214: para. (<i>b</i>) of definition <span class="st"><span style="color:#222222">—</span></span> that is, “dealing with a child in a manner that is likely to leave that child exposed to risk”. As he put it, “[t]he terms ‘in a manner . . . likely . . .’ . . . &nbsp;speak of the societal rather than a personal standard of conduct” (para. 32). However, I do not think that the word “likely” in this context is an indication of legislative intent to require only objective fault, for two reasons.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The French version of the s. 214 definition uses the terms “<i>pouvant l’exposer</i>” and the French version of the s. 218 offence uses the terms “<i>exposée à l’être</i>”. The French wording suggests that the focus is on the outcome of the conduct rather than on the standard of care. This makes it clear that the English word “likely” serves the same purpose. Moreover, as I have discussed, the purpose of the child abandonment offence is to criminalize the creation of the risk of harm; it makes it an offence to expose or abandon a child such that its life or health is put at serious risk even if no harm actually results. This is consistent with the well-established view that the criminal law may properly be aimed at preventing the risk of serious harm: see, e.g., <i>R. v.</i> <i>Keegstra</i>,<i> </i>[1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at p. 776; <i>Lucas</i>, at para. 83.&nbsp; The word “likely”, as it is used in both the s. 214 definition and in the offence provision itself (s. 218), is consistent with this preventive purpose. This purpose of criminalizing the creation of a serious risk of harm is not at all inconsistent with a requirement of subjective fault <span class="st"><span style="color:#222222">—</span></span> that is, actual knowledge of the risk of harm <span class="st"><span style="color:#222222">—</span></span> as is clear from the Court’s decision in<i> Lucas.</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Lucas </i>concerned the fault element of publishing a defamatory libel under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec300" target="_blank">s. 300<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. A defamatory libel is defined in s. 298 to be a “matter published . . . that is likely to injure the reputation of any person”.&nbsp; The Court held that the fault element of the offence requires proof that the accused knew that the published material was defamatory, in other words, that it was “likely to injure the reputation of any person”, <i>per</i> Cory J., at paras. 30 and 67-68. Thus, the term “likely to injure the reputation” was found to require proof of subjective fault, i.e. that the accused actually knew of the risk of injury to reputation.</p>

How those provisions are drafted sheds some light on the sorts of language used when that is the intent. As I see it, the text of the child abandonment provision does not contain any of the language typically employed by Parliament when it intends to create an offence of objective fault.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will briefly review five main types of objective fault offences in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> in order to explain why, in my view, a comparison of the way they are drafted with the text of s. 218 supports the inference that the latter requires subjective fault. This will lead me to explain why I reject the Crown’s position that penal negligence should apply to the s. 218 offence because it applies to the s. 215 offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[57]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We come first to offences defined in terms of dangerous conduct. In<i> R. v. Hundal</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, the Court found that the fault element of the offence of dangerous driving was a manner of driving which constituted a “marked departure” from that expected of a reasonable person in the same circumstances. (See also, more recently, <i>Beatty</i> and <i>R. v. Roy</i>, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 60.) Several factors justified adopting an objective rather than a subjective fault requirement: driving is a regulated activity in which people choose to engage; driving is automatic and reflexive in nature; and the text of the offence focuses on the manner of driving, all of which suggest that the offence seeks to impose a minimum uniform standard of care.&nbsp; Cory J. noted, for example, that “[l]icensed drivers choose to engage in the regulated activity of driving. <u>They place themselves in a position of responsibility</u> to other members of the public who use the roads”: <i>Hundal</i>, at p. 884 (emphasis added).&nbsp; With respect to the text of the provision, Cory J. observed that it creates an offence of driving “in a manner that is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances” and this suggests an objective standard: “The ‘manner of driving’ can only be compared to a standard of reasonable conduct” (p. 885). So in the case of dangerous driving both the text and nature of the provision, as well as other factors, provided strong support for an objective fault element.&nbsp; None of those factors is present in the s. 218 offence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, there are offences which are expressed in terms of careless conduct, such as the careless storage of firearms.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Finlay</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 103, the Court concluded that the carelessness targeted by the offence is not consistent with subjective fault.&nbsp; The provision required the Crown to establish that a firearm was used, carried, handled, shipped or stored “in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons”. The use of the word “careless” and the reference to “reasonable precautions” were clear markers of objectively assessed fault (pp. 114-15). There is no similar language in s. 218.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A third category relates to so-called predicate offences. These are offences such as unlawful act manslaughter and unlawfully causing bodily harm which require the commission of an underlying unlawful act.&nbsp; They have been found to require the mental element for the underlying offence but only objective foresight of harm flowing from it:&nbsp; see, e.g., <i>R. v. DeSousa</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944 (unlawfully causing bodily harm); <i>R. v. Creighton</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3 (unlawful act manslaughter).&nbsp; Without reiterating the detailed reasons given in those cases, I simply underline that these offences are ones in which the commission of the predicate or underlying offence has actual and serious consequences. As Sopinka J. said in <i>DeSousa</i> (at p. 967) and McLachlin J. repeated in <i>Creighton</i> (at p. 55): “The implicit rationale of the law in this area is that it is acceptable to distinguish between criminal responsibility for equally reprehensible acts on the basis of the harm that is actually caused.” This rationale has no application to s. 218; there is neither a predicate offence nor any need to show that actual harm resulted from the conduct in the child abandonment offence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On that point, I note that at the court of appeal level, the Crown suggested that the word “unlawfully” in s. 218 was intended to imply that a violation of s. 215 constituted a predicate offence to child abandonment. I disagree. Rather, I agree with Richards J.A. that the word “unlawfully” in s. 218 is mere surplusage that was left from the original text in <i>An Act respecting Offences against the Person</i> (1869), s. 26: see, e.g., <i>R. v. Chartrand</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, at pp. 886-87.&nbsp; The commission of a s. 215 offence, or any other offence, is not required for purposes of a child abandonment conviction. Section 218 has a broader application than s. 215, which only applies to specific individuals. To hold that a conviction under s. 218 is dependent upon a conviction under s. 215 would overlook the words “[e]very one” in s. 218, would void para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition of meaning, and would render s. 218 redundant, as it would serve the exact same purpose as s. 215. Section 218 does not provide for a greater sentence and therefore it is not merely an enhanced form of s. 215, in the way that, for example, unlawfully causing bodily harm (s. 269, maximum sentence of 10 years) is an enhanced version of assault (s. 266, maximum sentence of 5 years).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I should also refer to the offences based on criminal negligence:&nbsp; see, e.g., ss. 219, 220 and 221. Criminal negligence is defined as conduct that “shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons” (s. 219).&nbsp; The text of this provision has fueled much debate about the required fault element.&nbsp; The use of the word “negligence” in the name of the offence suggests an objectively defined standard consistent with the meaning of the word “negligence” in the common law of torts.&nbsp; On the other hand, the words “wanton and reckless disregard” could be taken as describing actual knowledge of the risk created by the conduct and therefore a subjective fault element: see <i>R. v. Anderson</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 265, at pp. 269-70. Ultimately, the Court decided that proof of intention or actual foresight of a prohibited consequence is not required. Rather, criminal negligence requires a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in circumstances in which the accused either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk or, alternatively, gave no thought to that risk:&nbsp; <i>R. v.

Consideration of this category and of this submission requires a closer look at the scheme of the <i>Code</i> and the Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Naglik</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-85.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Scheme of the Code </i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Various legal duties are set out in ss. 215, 216, 217 and 217.1, including duties to provide the necessaries of life and to use reasonable knowledge, skill and care in administering surgical or medical treatment.&nbsp; However, s. 215 is the only provision that creates an offence, that of failing to provide the necessaries of life.&nbsp; The Court in <i>Naglik </i>held that this offence is one of objective fault and the Crown appellant submits that the same reasoning should apply to the abandonment offence under s. 218.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, this submission is not persuasive. The s. 215 offence is structured entirely differently than the s. 218 offence that concerns us here and the reasoning of <i>Naglik</i> is not applicable to the s. 218 offence. That reasoning in fact supports the view that <i>subjective</i> fault is required in s. 218. Finally, the different purposes served by both offences also support that view.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider first the differences in the text of the two provisions. Unlike the s. 218 child abandonment offence, the s. 215 necessaries of life offence considered in <i>Naglik</i> is defined in terms of failure to perform specified legal duties. What is more, these specified legal duties arise out of specified relationships between the person owing the duty and the person to whom the duty is owed.&nbsp; (The text of s. 215 is found in the Appendix.)</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[67]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essence of the s. 215 offence, then, is that it imposes legal duties arising out of defined relationships.&nbsp; It is clear that the decision in <i>Naglik</i> was based on that premise. Lamer C.J. writes, in <i>Naglik</i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">With respect to the wording of s. 215, while there is no language in s. 215 such as “ought to have known” indicating that Parliament intended an objective standard of fault, the language of s. 215 referring to the failure to perform a “duty” suggests that the accused’s conduct in a particular circumstance is to be determined on an objective, or community, standard.&nbsp; The concept of a duty indicates a societal minimum which has been established for conduct:&nbsp; as in the law of civil negligence, a duty would be meaningless if every individual defined its content for him- or herself according to his or her subjective beliefs and priorities.&nbsp; Therefore, the conduct of the accused should be measured against an objective, societal standard to give effect to the concept of “duty” employed by Parliament. [p. 141]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that this reasoning applies equally to s. 218 because that offence, too, may be committed by a person who fails in a legal duty to take charge of a child. I do not accept this position.&nbsp; While failure to perform a duty imposed by law on persons in particular relationships is the essence of the offence created by s. 215, this is not at all the case with respect to child abandonment under s. 218.&nbsp; This is why the reasoning of <i>Naglik</i> cannot apply to s. 218. The child abandonment offence may be committed by “[e]very one”; it is not restricted to persons in particular relationships or under specified, statutorily created legal duties. The concept of duty in the child abandonment offence becomes relevant only in relation to an omission and is found in the non-exhaustive definition of “abandon” or “expose”.&nbsp; Those terms include “a wilful omission to take charge of a child by a person who is under a legal duty to do so”: para. (<i>a</i>) of the s. 214 definition.&nbsp; In my opinion, the reference to “legal duty” in relation to omissions in this section simply gives effect to the common law principle that criminal responsibility generally does not arise from an omission unless there is a pre-existing legal duty to act: see, e.g., Roach (2012), at p. 115; D. Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise</i> (6th ed. 2011), at p. 95. Therefore, the effect of the reference to duty in para. (<i>a</i>) of the s. 214 definition is to ensure that the offence applies to omissions by those with a legal duty towards a child.&nbsp; However, the child abandonment offence does not impose any such duties and people with no duty may be liable, but only for positive acts captured, for example, by the words “dealing with” in para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The brief comments about the child abandonment offence in both Stuart, at p. 96, and Roach (2012), at p. 116, do not support the view that the fault element of the offence is objective.&nbsp; Rather they point out, as I have just discussed, that the concept of duty appears in this offence only in relation to omissions. As for the Manning and Sankoff treatise, it expresses the view the s. 218 offence is “entirely superfluous” (p. 826) <span class="st"><span style="color:#222222">—</span></span> a conclusion with which I disagree for the reasons I have already set out.&nbsp; I note that some of the case law cited by Manning and Sankoff involved parents who were convicted of child abandonment for having <i>knowingly</i> left their child in risky circumstances: p. 827, notes 155-56; <i>Christiansen</i>, at para. 8; <i>R. v. Holzer </i>(1988), 63 C.R. (3d) 301 (Alta. Q.B.), at p. 303.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Further, it seems to me that the clearly different structures of the text of s. 218 on one hand, and the duty-based offence in s. 215 on the other, support the view that the s. 218 offence is different. Where Parliament intended to base an offence on violation of a duty, s. 215 shows that it could find the language to do so clearly.&nbsp; None of this sort of language appears in s. 218.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The distinct structure and wording of the child abandonment offence also counter any suggestion that its placement in the same part of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> with the sections creating legal duties (i.e. ss. 215 to 217.1) informs the nature of the required fault element. The placement of a provision within the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>or the elements of other offences in the same part of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> do not often assist in determining the nature of its fault requirement and are particularly unhelpful here: see, e.g., <i>Pappajohn</i>,<i> </i>at p. 146. While the provision is placed under the heading “Duties Tending to Preservation of Life”, the marginal note of s. 218, “Abandoning child” is the only one of the five sections under this heading which does <i>not</i> have the word “duty” in its marginal note. If anything, this tends to underline that it is different from the other provisions.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The child abandonment offence has the same range of possible punishments as does the objective fault offence of failing to provide necessaries in s. 215. However, the range of punishments says little about the required fault element. To take a stark example, criminal negligence causing death, with a possible punishment of life in prison, has an objective fault element requirement. Theft under five thousand dollars, which may be prosecuted by summary conviction, is an offence not only requiring subjective fault but specific intent.&nbsp; I do not find any help in defining the fault requirement of the child abandonment offence that other offences which may be punished with the same or even greater periods of imprisonment require only objective fault.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Conclusion on the Text of the Provision and Scheme of the Code</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To sum up, none of the considerations that persuaded the Court to adopt an objective fault standard in the categories of offences I have just reviewed is present in the child abandonment offence under s. 218. The prohibition applies to everyone, not just to a particular group engaged in a regulated activity or standing in a particular, defined relationship with the alleged victim.&nbsp; Nothing in the text suggests an intention to impose a minimum and uniform standard of care.&nbsp; There are no references in the text to “dangerous”, “careless” or “reasonable” conduct or any requirement to take “reasonable precautions”.&nbsp; There is no predicate offence and no actual harm is required by the provision. The provision does not create, define or impose a duty to do anything other than in the sense that all criminal offences could be considered to create a duty not to commit them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[74]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that both what is present in s. 218 of the <i>Code</i> and its related provisions and what is absent from it strongly support the view that a subjective fault element is required.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its essence, s. 218 is child protection legislation.&nbsp; It seeks to protect a limited class of people (children under the age of 10) from two defined risks (death or permanent injury) that occur or are likely to occur from abandoning or exposing the child.&nbsp; And, as I will explain, the section is aimed at three limited classes of people faced with a situation where a child under 10 is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent injury:&nbsp; (1) those who have a pre-existing and an ongoing legal duty to take charge of the child; (2) those who choose to come to the aid of the child in that situation; and (3) those who place the child in that situation.</p>

24.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an act of abandonment or exposure,</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These three elements have been termed “acts”, “circumstances” and “consequences”.&nbsp; See D. Ormerod, <i>Smith and Hogan’s Criminal Law </i>(13th ed. 2011), at p. 56.&nbsp; The act — here, abandonment or exposure — speaks to the conduct that, on its own or because of its consequences, the law seeks to punish.&nbsp; The circumstances — here, a child under 10 — bring more specificity to the conduct by identifying certain facts or conditions that must be present.&nbsp; Finally, the consequences — here, the risk to the child’s life or health — are the result that the law seeks to prevent.&nbsp; Breaking an offence down into its various parts is important because, as Professor Ormerod observes, “the law may require different mental elements for the various constituents” (p. 56).&nbsp; This is true with respect to s. 218 and, for reasons I will explain, care must thus be taken to distinguish between the act, its circumstances and its consequences in assessing the requisite <i>mens rea </i>for the offence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>mens rea</i> of an offence “does not exist in the air or in the abstract but must be related to certain consequences or circumstances” (K. Roach, <i>Criminal Law</i> (5th ed. 2012), at p. 164).&nbsp; As a general rule, a mental element, whether subjective or objective, will accompany each physical element of a crime, be it the act, its circumstances or its consequences.&nbsp; For example, as the third element in s. 218 requires that the child’s life or health is or is likely to be placed at risk, absent an exception to the rule, there must be an accompanying mental element of some kind, whether subjective or objective, that addresses the accused’s state of mind in respect of the risk to the child.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it is worth recalling that a particular offence may well have some mental elements that are assessed subjectively and others that are assessed objectively.<i> </i>&nbsp;In <i>R. v. Hinchey</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1128, at para. 80, L’Heureux-Dubé J., for the majority, refused to accept that “an offence must be either subjective or objective with no possible middle ground”.&nbsp; In her view,</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">the <i>mens rea</i> of a particular offence is composed of the totality of its component fault elements.&nbsp; The mere fact that most criminal offences require <u>some</u> subjective component does not mean that every element of the offence requires such a state of mind.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original; para. 80.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">With that point in mind, one must be careful not to speak of a crime as requiring simply subjective or objective <i>mens rea</i>.&nbsp; Such conclusions “tel[l] only part of the story”, and a “more precise approach” requires identifying each mental element in relation to its coordinate physical element (Roach, at p. 164).&nbsp; Accordingly, the task before us is to identify the mental element <i>for each </i>of the three physical elements of the offence of child abandonment — the act, the circumstances and the consequences.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That brings me to the presumption that Parliament intends crimes to have a subjective fault element.&nbsp; My colleague does a thorough analysis of the subject and concludes that</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">the presumption of subjective fault is not an outdated rule of construction which is at odds with the modern approach to statutory interpretation repeatedly endorsed by the Court.&nbsp; On the contrary, the presumption forms part of the context which the modern approach requires to be considered.&nbsp; [para. 28]</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:13.7pt">While generally correct, even [the presumption of subjective <i>mens rea</i>] runs the possibility of being misinterpreted.&nbsp; Although subjective fault is clearly the preferred standard, this has not always extended to every element of the offence, and <u>it is particularly controversial in relation to the mental foresight required for particular consequences</u>.

DeSousa</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, have made clear that criminal law may justifiably “distinguish between criminal responsibility for equally reprehensible acts on the basis of the harm that is actually caused” (p. 967).&nbsp; Thus, for so-called “predicate” offences, the law requires subjective <i>mens rea</i> only for the underlying act, while accepting objective <i>mens rea </i>for the <i>consequences </i>that flow from that act.&nbsp; As McLachlin J. (as she then was) aptly put it in <i>R. v. Creighton</i>, </span>[1993] 3 S.C.R. 3<span style="line-height:200%">, at p. 54, “[c]onsequences can be important.”</span></p>

Lohnes</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 167<i> </i>(causing a disturbance); <i>R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606 (conspiracy to prevent or lessen competition unduly); <i>R. v. Naglik</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122 (failing to provide the necessaries of life).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[95]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, s. 218 is child protection legislation.&nbsp; It seeks to protect children under the age of 10 who cannot fend for themselves and who, for that reason, are among society’s most vulnerable members.&nbsp; To be sure, abandoning or exposing a child under the age of 10 is a risky matter.&nbsp; No reasonable person would suggest otherwise.&nbsp; Given the inherent danger of abandoning or exposing a helpless child, Parliament has chosen to criminalize such conduct, but only to the extent that it places or is likely to place the child at risk of death or permanent injury.&nbsp; To put the matter somewhat differently, s. 218 reflects an effort by Parliament to require certain individuals to take care of a young child in certain situations that threaten its life or health.&nbsp; In the interests of protecting the child, the provision thus imposes a societal minimum standard of conduct.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once it is accepted that in enacting s. 218 Parliament intended to guard against dangerous conduct that any reasonable person would foresee is likely to endanger a child’s life or expose it to permanent injury, I fail to see why Parliament would turn around and provide accused persons with a host of defences based on their individual characteristics.&nbsp; Doing so would effectively defeat the provision’s purpose of imposing a societal minimum standard of conduct, since crimes of subjective fault require an assessment of personal characteristics to the extent that they tend to prove or disprove an element of the offence (<i>Creighton</i>, at p. 63).&nbsp; Age, temperament, mental development, experience, sophistication and education would all factor into the determination of whether a particular accused appreciated the risk of harm resulting from the inherently dangerous conduct of abandoning or exposing a helpless child.&nbsp; Of particular concern, such an approach would provide a defence to the errant parent or irresponsible caregiver who, by virtue of intoxication, could not or did not foresee the likely consequences of his or her dangerous conduct, whether it be locking a child in a car on a hot summer’s day or exposing a child to the elements on a cold winter’s night.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">Section 215 is aimed at establishing a uniform minimum level of care to be provided for those to whom it applies, and <u>this can only be achieved if those under the duty are held to a societal, rather than a personal, standard of conduct</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; p. 141.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Justice McLachlin (as she then was), speaking for the majority on this issue, went further, holding that personal factors such as “youth, experience, [and] education” have no place in adjudicating fault for this kind of offence (p. 148).&nbsp; With respect, I believe the same holds true for s. 218.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[102]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of this language, s. 218 plainly takes in a large swath of people <i>who owe a legal duty</i> to take charge of a child under the age of 10 — including parents, foster parents and guardians, the people most likely to run afoul of the provision by virtue of being the central figures in a child’s life. Once that is accepted, as I think it must be, I fail to see how or why the provision should not be characterized as “duty-based”.</p>

(<i>b</i>) of the definition of “abandon” or “expose” in s. 214.&nbsp; That part of the definition includes persons “dealing with a child in a manner that is likely to leave that child exposed to risk without protection”, which at first blush could be read as sweeping in a large number of people who have no pre-existing duty to the child.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</p>

(<i>b</i>) (to restrict the scope of criminal liability).&nbsp; However, this result — a single crime that contemplates different mental standards for different persons engaging in the same culpable acts — is entirely foreign to our criminal law.&nbsp; Surely, Parliament did not intend this.&nbsp; The only remaining option, then, might be to allow persons with a pre-existing and ongoing duty to reap the benefit of the subjective higher standard, even if that created a double standard for them.&nbsp; Such a result, it might be argued, would ensure that those additional individuals caught by para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition are not unjustly branded as criminals.&nbsp; That is the approach the majority adopts.</p>

(<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition is broad.&nbsp; The plain language of the words “dealing with a child” can connote much; the question is how much.&nbsp; In my view, they are meant to capture those people who take active steps to alleviate a situation or who place a child in a situation that will, or is likely to, endanger the child’s life or cause it permanent injury — the second and third groups to which I referred above.&nbsp; Such persons are cloaked with a <i>situational </i>duty to take reasonable steps to preserve and protect the life and safety of the child during the course of their limited involvement with the child.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of the present case provide a fitting example.&nbsp; The store manager became duty-bound to the child, A.J.H., when he removed him from the toilet.&nbsp; Having taken active steps to come to the child’s aid, he was cloaked with a duty to take reasonable steps to protect the child from further harm.&nbsp; No such duty attached to the assistant store manager or the store patrons, however, as they did not choose to become directly involved with the child.&nbsp; Consequently, they did not “dea[l] with” the child within the meaning of s. 214.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><b>217.&nbsp; </b>Every one who undertakes to do an act is under a legal duty to do it if an omission to do the act is or may be dangerous to life.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much like the language in para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition of “abandon” or “expose”, the language of “undertak[ing] to do an act” in s. 217 is capable of a sweeping definition.&nbsp; But that is not the path the criminal law has followed — and wisely so.&nbsp; As Abella J.A. (as she then was) observed in <i>R. v. Browne</i> (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 775 (C.A.)&nbsp;:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">There is no doubt that the definition embraces an interpretive continuum ranging from an assertion to a promise.&nbsp; But it seems to me that when we are deciding whether conduct is caught by the web of criminal liability, the threshold definition we apply must justify penal sanctions. . . . The word “undertaking” in s. 217 must be interpreted in this context.&nbsp; <u>The threshold definition must be sufficiently high to justify such serious penal consequences.</u>&nbsp; The mere expression of words indicating a willingness to do an act cannot trigger the legal duty. There must be something in the nature of a commitment, generally, though not necessarily, upon which reliance can reasonably be said to have been placed.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; pp. 779-80.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, Justice Abella’s conclusion with respect to s. 217 points to the proper construction of para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition as cloaking with a duty to act reasonably only those people who by active steps undertake to preserve and protect a child from death or permanent injury (the second group mentioned above).&nbsp; By the same token, it does not require a leap of logic to conclude that “dealing with” a child within the meaning of para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition must similarly be restricted in scope to those who actually place the child in a situation in which it is put at risk of death or permanent injury (the third group).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[112]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When one steps back to look at the broader picture, the understanding that one’s positive actions can give rise to a situational duty is a principle well known to the common law.&nbsp; As Professors Colvin and Anand have noted, historically there have been “three reasonably well-established categories of duty to act” (<i>Principles of Criminal Law</i> (3rd ed. 2007), at p. 141).&nbsp; The first is well known and concerns “general relationships of care and protection”, such as those captured by para. (<i>a</i>) of the s. 214 definition.&nbsp; The second concerns “specific undertakings to act” (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Nicholls</i> (1874), 13 Cox C.C. 75; <i>R. v. Instan</i>, [1893] 1 Q.B. 450) and the third concerns duties arising from “causal responsibility for dangerous situations” (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Salmon </i>(1880), 6 Q.B.D. 79; <i>R. v. Coyne</i> (1958), 124 C.C.C. 176 (N.B.S.C. (App. Div.)); <i>R. v. Miller</i>, [1983] 1 All E.R. 978 (H.L.)).&nbsp; See also Ormerod, at pp. 70-75 (including “[p]arents and other relations”, “[v]oluntary undertakings”, and “[c]reating a dangerous situation” as categories).&nbsp; These three categories map precisely to the three groups of individuals who I conclude come within the ambit of s. 218.&nbsp; While it is, of course, true that our criminal law does not include common law offences, in my view, the wording of para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition reflects a specific statutory <a name="_Hlk352234436">instantiation </a>of the second and third of these long-standing common law principles — much like ss. 216, 217 and 217.1 do — in this case with respect to young children.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[113]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreting the scope of s. 218 in this way, as I believe it was meant to be, goes a long way toward addressing concerns about the broad scope of potential liability under the provision.&nbsp; The spectre of criminal liability under the offence is not overly broad.&nbsp; Indeed, the interpretation I favour may be narrower<i> </i>than that endorsed in the majority position, which does not delineate the type of conduct that would amount to “dealing with” a child.&nbsp; All else being equal, I thus cannot accept that the scope<i> </i>of this offence is a valid ground to require subjective foresight of the consequences proscribed by s. 218.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[115]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her text, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i> (5th ed. 2008), Professor Ruth Sullivan, a leading authority on the construction of statutes, observes that “headings are a valid indicator of legislative meaning and may be taken into account in interpretation” (p. 394).&nbsp; See also <i>R. v. Lucas</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 47.&nbsp; Of particular note, in discussing the relationship between provisions grouped under the same heading, she writes:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When provisions are grouped together under a heading <u>it is presumed that they are related to one another in some particular way</u>, that there is a shared subject or object or a common feature to the provisions.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 396.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[116]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I do not place undue weight on it, I think some significance can be attached to the fact that s. 218 is coupled with one other offence, s. 215, which is clearly duty-based.&nbsp; And as I have just noted, s. 218 is grouped with other provisions (ss. 216, 217 and 217.1) that speak to the creation of legal duties in particular circumstances.&nbsp; Manifestly, s. 218 is embedded in a number of provisions which have, as their common denominator, the concept of “duty”.&nbsp; That being so, it seems anomalous that Parliament would, for no apparent reason, insert a non-duty-based offence into a thicket of duty-related provisions.&nbsp; The scenario becomes even more remarkable when one appreciates that s. 218 is concerned with inherently dangerous conduct that is or is likely to put the lives and safety of helpless young children at risk — the very type of situation which, in my view, requires a societal minimum standard of conduct and calls out for a standard of fault based on objective foreseeability.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[117]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason, in my view, why the word “duty” is not found in s. 218 is because s. 218 deals primarily with acts of commission, whereas s. 215 deals with acts of omission.&nbsp; We do not speak of parents failing “not to abandon” their children or failing “not to expose” them to the risk of death or permanent injury.&nbsp; The gravamen of s. 218 lies not in the failure of an accused to do that which he or she is legally obliged to do (although para. (<i>a</i>) of the s. 214 definition accounts for such a situation) but rather, the doing of something that is inherently dangerous — abandoning or exposing a helpless child to the risk of death or permanent injury.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">The first is where the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> offences refer to a duty without defining it.&nbsp; Examples occur in the case of the offences of permitting an escape by failing to perform “a legal duty” (section 146(<i>a</i>)), committing a common nuisance by failing to discharge “a legal duty” (section 180), and <u>abandoning a child by omitting to take charge of it when under “a legal duty to do so”</u> (sections 214 and 218). [Emphasis added; p. 96.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[120]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have explained, narrowing the scope of the offence under s. 218 exclusively to those who have a pre-existing and ongoing duty cannot be supported by the plain text of the provision in light of para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition of “abandon” or “expose”.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I would take Professor Stuart as making the more modest point that s. 218 at least in part looks to those with such pre-existing and ongoing duties and, as such, is properly characterized as duty-based.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[121]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise, Professor Roach, at pp. 115-16 of his text, explains that although an omission will not generally constitute the <i>actus reus</i> of an offence, a failure to act will suffice where an individual has a “specific legal duty to act”.&nbsp; He then includes child abandonment in his list of duty-based offences:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:22.5pt">There is a duty to use reasonable care when providing medical treatment or other lawful acts that may endanger the life of others.&nbsp; This duty was breached by a person who donated blood that he knew was infected with HIV.&nbsp; It is also an offence not to use reasonable care in handling explosives; to disobey a court order; to fail to assist a peace officer when requested; <u>to abandon a child</u>; not to obtain assistance in child-birth; to fail to stop when your vehicle is involved in an accident; to neglect animals; and to fail to take steps to protect holes in ice or open excavations.&nbsp; [Footnotes omitted; emphasis added; p. 116.]</p>

(<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition of “abandon” or “expose” and I do not comment on their thesis that s. 218 is superfluous.&nbsp; But setting those matters aside, in saying that s. 218 is entirely subsumed by s. 215 — which everyone agrees is a duty-based offence — these authors must be taken as accepting that s. 218 is likewise a duty-based offence.</p>

(<i>a</i>) of the s. 214 definition, those with a pre-existing and ongoing duty to take charge of the child; second, by virtue of para. (<i>b</i>), those who “dea[l] with” the child by undertaking positive steps to come to its aid in that situation; and third, again by virtue of para. (<i>b</i>), those who “dea[l] with” the child by placing it in that situation.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[124]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With this in mind, I turn again to the wording of s. 218, and particularly the language employed with respect to the consequences, the mental element of which forms the crux of this case:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span class="sectionlabel"><b>218.</b></span> Every one who unlawfully abandons or exposes a child who is under the age of ten years, <u>so that its life is or is likely to be endangered or its health is or is likely to be permanently injured</u> . . . .</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[125]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This language, which we are tasked with interpreting today, is strikingly similar to that which this Court explained in the context of s. 215, the sister provision to s. 218 concerning a failure to provide the necessaries of life.&nbsp; As I have already mentioned, this Court held in <i>Naglik </i>that the <i>mens rea </i>for s. 215 is in relevant part satisfied on an objective basis.<i>&nbsp; </i>In an opinion unanimous on this issue, Lamer C.J., at p. 143, asked rhetorically, “<span style="line-height:200%">What parts of the offence must be objectively foreseeable?” and then identified the subparagraph in s. 215 that I emphasize below:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:22.7pt">(2) Every one commits an offence who, being under a legal duty within the meaning of subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on him, to perform that duty, if</p>

(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition of “abandon” or “expose” — with one notable exception.&nbsp; The second half of s. 216(2) reads “any mode of dealing with [the child] <u>calculated</u> to leave it exposed to risk without protection”, whereas para. (<i>b</i>) of the s. 214 definition reads “dealing with a child in a manner <u>that is likely</u> to leave that child exposed to risk without protection”.&nbsp; In short, the words “calculated to leave” were replaced by the words “likely to leave”.&nbsp; Though the change may appear highly meaningful to modern eyes, care must be taken not to confuse obsolete and current meanings of those words. As the majority observes, in the 18th and 19th centuries, “calculated to” and “likely to” were synonyms.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[132]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plain language of the provision aside, early judicial interpretations of the child abandonment provision can be helpful in interpreting the modern-day s. 218.&nbsp; In the leading English authority of <i>R. v. White</i> (1871), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 311, a father failed to take custody of his nine-month-old child.&nbsp; The child was left on the road in front of the father’s home by his estranged wife, who demanded that he take the child.&nbsp; The father was charged and convicted under s. 27 of <i>The Offences against the Person Act, 1861</i>, and the conviction was upheld on appeal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[133]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>White</i> decision makes no mention of subjective <i>mens rea </i>as being required to make out the offence of abandonment.&nbsp; Indeed, it suggests the opposite, as evidenced by the following passage from Chief Justice Bovill’s opinion, to which the remaining four justices subscribed:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Instead of protecting and providing for the child, as it was his duty to do, [the father] allowed it to remain lying, first at his door, and afterwards in the road, insufficiently clothed, and at a time of year <u>when the result was likely to be the child’s death</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 313.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">In my view, the language used by Bovill C.J. is the language of objective foreseeability (death was the likely result) and not the language of subjective foreseeability (he <i>knew</i> that death was likely to result).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[134]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that in a separate opinion written by Blackburn J., language is used from which one might conclude that he viewed the crime of abandonment as requiring subjective foresight:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:58.5pt">. . . upon [the father] there is a strict legal duty to protect the child.&nbsp; And when the child is left in a position of danger of which he knows, and from which he has full power to remove it, and he neglects his duty of protection, and lets the child remain in danger, I think this is an exposure and abandonment by him. [p. 314]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">I do not read that passage as indicating that subjective foresight is required to make out the offence of abandonment.&nbsp; Rather, on Justice Blackburn’s assessment of the facts, the father clearly knew that the child’s life was imperilled and yet did nothing about it.&nbsp; I would not, and do not, suggest that a person who in fact subjectively foresees a risk of death or permanent injury to the child cannot be convicted under s. 218.&nbsp; But that is different from holding that subjective foreseeability is an essential ingredient of the crime.&nbsp; Where an offence is satisfied — at a minimum — on an objective standard, subjective proof will obviously suffice to sustain a conviction.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Beatty</i>, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, at para. 47; <i>R. v. Roy</i>, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 60, at para. 38.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[135]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude on this point, the fact that the provision contains no words that can be read as requiring subjective foresight of the proscribed consequences is significant.&nbsp; As mentioned, the words “calculated to leave” were removed in the 1953-54 <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and replaced by the words “likely to leave”.&nbsp; At the same time, the age of protected children was raised from two years to ten years and the word “whereby” was replaced with the synonymous words “so that”.&nbsp; If Parliament had wanted to make it clear that subjective foreseeability was the requisite fault element, it could have done so when revising the language of the provision by using the words “knowing that” instead of “so that” in s. 218 and by changing the words “calculated to leave” to “he knows is or is likely to leave” in para. (<i>b</i>) of the&nbsp;s.&nbsp;214 definition.&nbsp; As Professor Sullivan notes, “[i]t is presumed that in so far as possible legislatures will adopt a simple, straightforward and concise way of expressing themselves” (p. 207).&nbsp; But instead of making what would have been a straightforward change, Parliament preserved the original meaning of the provision which, as I have attempted to show, was understood as requiring objective, not subjective, foreseeability of the prohibited consequences.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT">E.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Social Stigma and Gravity of the Offence Support an Objective Standard for the Proscribed Consequences</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[136]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I touch, finally, on two other factors that support the conclusion that the fault element for s. 218 is penal negligence:&nbsp; the social stigma attached to the crime of child abandonment and the gravity of the crime.&nbsp; As McLachlin J., for the majority, observed in <i>Creighton</i>, at p. 46, the <i>mens rea </i>of an offence should reflect the gravity of the crime.&nbsp; Both the social stigma associated with its commission and the penalty provided by Parliament afford a measure of that gravity.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[137]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The social stigma associated with the offence of child abandonment cannot — and in my view should not — be treated differently than the social stigma associated with its sister provision s. 215 (failure to provide necessaries) where penal negligence was found to be the requisite fault element.&nbsp; Indeed, as I noted earlier, in their treatise, at p. 826, Manning and Sankoff write that the offence of child abandonment is “entirely superfluous” given its overlap with the offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec215" target="_blank">s. 215<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Given that the “necessaries of life” include shelter and protection from harm, there does not appear to be a conceivable situation in which abandonment would not also constitute a failure to provide the necessaries of life.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[138]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether that statement is entirely accurate or not, it leads me to conclude that ss. 215 and 218 should be ranked equally on the social stigma scale.&nbsp; They certainly rank equally in terms of their gravity.&nbsp; Both offences are punishable by a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment (if the Crown proceeds by way of indictment) and 18 months’ imprisonment (if the Crown proceeds by way of summary conviction).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[139]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put differently, if Parliament had intended to build subjective foreseeability into s. 218, the degree of moral blameworthiness would necessarily be higher than that required to sustain a conviction under s. 215, which requires only objective foreseeability.&nbsp; If that were the case, one could reasonably expect, in my view, that the higher level of moral culpability would be reflected by a more severe punishment.&nbsp; But this is not so.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; And that leads me to conclude that the two provisions encompass the same degree of blameworthiness and thus require the same degree of mental fault.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[140]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, without wishing to minimize the nature and severity of the punishments available under ss. 215 and 218, they are significantly removed from other crimes which this Court has held to be crimes involving objective foresight, including manslaughter and certain instances of dangerous driving causing death — both of which attract maximum punishments of life imprisonment.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Remaining Elements of the Offence</i></p>

 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>“Abandon” or “Expose” — And the “Wilful” Red Herring</u></p>

(<i>a</i>) of the s. 214 definition of “abandon” or “expose” to modify the word “omission”.&nbsp; Much of the focus on the word, unfortunately, has served as a red herring, distracting from its actual function in the language of s. 218.&nbsp; Whatever meaning attaches to “wilful”, it speaks to the interpretation to be given to the act in the first element of the offence (abandoning or exposing).&nbsp; It offers little, if any, assistance in interpreting the third element (risk to the child).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[143]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As far back as 1898, in the case of <i>R. v. Senior</i>, [1899] 1 Q.B. 283, Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. considered the meaning of the word “wilfully” in s. 1 of the <i>Prevention of Cruelty to Children</i> <i>Act, 1894</i>, 57 &amp; 58 Vict., c. 41, which among other things, made it an offence to “wilfully” assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose a child under the age of 16 “in a manner likely to cause such child unnecessary suffering, or injury to its health”.&nbsp; At pp. 290-91, the Chief Justice stated:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Whether the words in the statute, “wilfully neglects,” are taken together, or, as the learned judge did in directing the jury, are taken separately, the meaning is very clear.&nbsp; <u>“Wilfully” means that the act is done deliberately and intentionally, not by accident or inadvertence, but so that the mind of the person who does the act goes with it.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[144]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Modern-day authorities have accepted that the word “wilful” may be used to indicate a voluntary or deliberate act, one that the mind “goes with”.&nbsp; See, e.g., <i>R. v. Buzzanga </i>(1979), 25 O.R. (2d) 705 (C.A.), at pp. 715-17; <i>R. v. L.B.</i>, 2011 ONCA 153, 274 O.A.C. 365, at paras. 108-9, leave to appeal refused, [2011] 3 S.C.R. x; and Manning and Sankoff, at pp. 149-50.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[145]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, a fair reading of the provision establishes that the word “wilful” in s. 214 does not connote an intention to bring about the proscribed consequences identified in s. 218.&nbsp; Rather, it modifies “omission” in para. (<i>a</i>) of the definition of “abandon” or “expose” and connotes, as Lord Russell C.J. described it, an act “done deliberately and intentionally, not by accident or inadvertence”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[146]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To put the matter in more contemporary terms, basic intent or voluntariness is all that is required to satisfy the minimum mental element for the act of abandonment or exposure.&nbsp; That conclusion sits independently from — and is entirely harmonious with — the separate conclusion that penal negligence is the proper mental standard for the third element in s. 218.&nbsp; It would be a mistake to confuse the two.</p>

 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:31.5pt;text-indent:-31.5pt">G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Some Thoughts on Intoxication as a Defence</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[148]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earlier in these reasons, I voiced my concern that an interpretation of s. 218 that requires subjective foresight of consequences would provide a defence to the errant parent or irresponsible caregiver who, by virtue of intoxication, could not or did not foresee the likely consequences of his or her dangerous conduct.&nbsp; While it is true that none of the parties raised this point in their arguments, I believe that the ramifications that flow from interpreting a statutory provision in one way or another are a necessary part of the overall contextual analysis with which we are engaged.&nbsp; That context cannot — and should not — be overlooked on the basis that a relevant issue does not arise on the facts of a particular case.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[149]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority concludes that s. 218 is a “general intent” offence (para. 16).&nbsp; I would have thought, however, that this Court’s decision in <i>Hinchey</i> has pointed us beyond the binary fiction of specific versus general intent offences.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; This case underscores the merit of that approach because the nub of the difficulty is that s. 218, whether under the majority’s approach or mine, does not — indeed, it cannot — fit neatly into either the general or specific intent boxes.&nbsp; To attempt to do so is to do what courts have for too long done — broad-brush offences in a way that at once over-generalizes and over-simplifies.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[150]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority’s invocation of <i>R. v.

Daley</i>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, confirms that a so-called <i>Daviault</i> defence of “extreme intoxication” relates only to intoxication which “negates <u>voluntariness</u> and thus is a complete defence to criminal responsibility” (para. 43 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; <i>Daviault </i>thus says nothing about whether intoxication short of automatism could raise a reasonable doubt about an accused’s subjective foresight of consequences, as the majority requires of s. 218.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[151]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec33.1" target="_blank">s. 33.1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, if it is applicable to s. 218, provides a statutory override of a <i>Daviault </i>defence — but only to the extent that the accused “lacked the <u>general intent or the voluntariness</u> required to commit the offence”.&nbsp; Assuming for the sake of argument that s. 33.1 does apply to s. 218,<i> </i>it says nothing about intoxication as a defence in relation to the subjective foresight of consequences. As I have said, <i>Daviault </i>was only concerned with the basic intent or voluntariness required for an intentional act.&nbsp; Thus, whether s. 33.1 does or does not apply to s. 218 is, in my respectful view, irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[153]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having so concluded, I hasten to point out that penal negligence involves a very real level of fault.&nbsp; This is emphatically not a matter of punishing the “morally blameless”.&nbsp; And while it may not reach the level of subjective fault in respect of each and every element of a particular crime, it does not punish people for acts of simple negligence.&nbsp; As Charron J. observed in <i>Beatty</i>, at para. 34:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">If every departure from the civil norm is to be criminalized, regardless of the degree, we risk casting the net too widely and branding as criminals persons who are in reality not morally blameworthy.</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">For that reason, an objective test “requires proof of a <i>marked departure</i> from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in all the circumstances”: <i>ibid.</i>, at para. 36 (emphasis in original).&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">However, because the accused’s mental state is relevant in a criminal setting, the objective test must be modified to give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt about whether the reasonable person would have appreciated the risk or could and would have done something to avoid creating the danger. . . .</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="text-indent:13.7pt">. . . In the same vein, a reasonably held mistake of fact may provide a complete defence if, based on the accused’s reasonable perception of the facts, the conduct measured up to the requisite standard of care.</p>
