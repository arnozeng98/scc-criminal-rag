(dissenting):&nbsp; The conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered.&nbsp; The only real issue at trial was whether the accused had acted with the requisite intent for murder.&nbsp; The trial judge misdirected the jury in that regard by twice suggesting to the jurors that they could consider the accused’s post‑offence conduct in determining his intent at the moment of the shooting.&nbsp; These were not isolated or fleeting comments.&nbsp; The impugned references all occurred in the context of his review of evidence and of Crown submissions explicitly and directly related to the accused’s intent when he caused the death of the police officer.&nbsp; These references formed an important part of his instruction to the jury on how they were to determine whether the accused had the requisite intent for murder.&nbsp; While the jury might well have understood that the trial judge was summarizing his entire discussion of the accused’s intent or, at the very least, the Crown’s theory on that issue, in either case, part of the evidence which the jury was invited to rely on included evidence of the accused’s post‑offence conduct.&nbsp; That is the problem.&nbsp; The trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that if they accepted the evidence he had reviewed for them, including the accused’s post‑offence conduct, they were free to conclude that the accused had the requisite intent for murder.&nbsp; This was an instruction in law, which the jury was bound to accept.&nbsp; It is of no moment that the trial judge’s instruction rested on a misunderstanding of the Crown’s position.&nbsp; What matters is that the jury was told by the trial judge that it could draw, in respect of the critical issue in the case, an inference prohibited by law.&nbsp; The judge’s instruction was plainly erroneous in law but, even if it were merely “confusing”, any uncertainty as to its meaning and effect would surely have to be resolved in the accused’s favour and not in the Crown’s favour.&nbsp; [47] [63] [75] [80] [82‑83] [85] [90] [97] [103]</span></p>

Watt, <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions </i>(2005), at p. 450). There is no basis for this Court to interfere with it.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.8pt">So, it seems to me, ladies and gentlemen, that the Crown’s theory as to why you should find the accused guilty of first-degree murder is this:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.8pt">The accused was not willing to leave the apartment on his own.&nbsp; He went to check his guns to intimidate Barbara [Ms. Ettinger], but also to make sure that they were ready.&nbsp; During the scuffle, the police officer was trying to get the accused out of the apartment, and along the way, the accused managed to get the shotgun out of the closet.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.8pt">During the struggle on the porch, the officer tried to take the shotgun away from the accused, and at one point, they separated, and the accused shot the police officer by pulling the trigger. Crown counsel reminded you of the neighbour’s evidence, Pauletta, who said she heard Barbara scream, “No, don’t,” when she heard the shot.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.8pt">Crown counsel also submitted that if the accused did not load the shotgun at the closet when he first checked it, he must have loaded it on the porch before the shot.&nbsp; The act of loading requires several deliberate steps; holding the release button and pumping the magazine.&nbsp; So, Crown counsel said the accused must have known to [<i>sic</i>] the shotgun was loaded.&nbsp; This, says Crown counsel, shows the accused’s intent, his state of mind, and shows that what happened was not an accident.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.8pt"><u>Furthermore, I think it is fair to say that the Crown says you should conclude that the accused knew he shot Constable Seewald because he did not even bother to check Constable Seewald before deciding, as he said, to kill himself.&nbsp; So, if you accept this evidence, you may conclude that at the moment Constable Seewald was shot, the accused intended to kill Constable Seewald, or at least intended to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to kill Constable Seewald, and he was reckless about whether the constable died or not.</u></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Seewald.&nbsp; Indeed, it was the very knowledge that he had killed the officer that supposedly caused him to threaten suicide in the first place.&nbsp; As a result, Vertes J.’s misstatement of the Crown’s submission on post-offence conduct did not put anything to the jury that they would not already have presumed.&nbsp; It cannot reasonably be argued that an undisputed, uncontroversial statement such as this one could lead to an unreasonable verdict under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) or a miscarriage of justice under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii).&nbsp; There is no suggestion here that the verdict was not reasonably supported by the evidence or that the jury was swayed by this misstatement in a way that could have resulted in an unfair trial: <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at pp. 540-41.&nbsp; Nor can it be said that the trial judge erred on a question of law as contemplated in s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii), since the error occurred while the trial judge was simply summarizing the Crown’s position, not while he was giving an instruction on a point of law.&nbsp; The theory on post-offence conduct mistakenly attributed to the Crown was not contrary to law or otherwise impermissible.&nbsp; The conclusion that the appellant knew he had shot the officer could easily, and fairly, be drawn from the evidence of his actions after the shooting.&nbsp; Since this error does not engage any of the three branches of s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>), it is of no consequence to this appeal.&nbsp;</p>

On this basis, Vertes J. might seem to be saying that the jury could infer the requisite intent for murder from the fact that the appellant had threatened to commit suicide without first checking on the officer’s condition.&nbsp; If this were a plausible interpretation of the passage, it might be reasonable to suggest that the trial judge erred in telling the jury they could make such an inference, and that this error falls under the third, and possibly the second, branch of s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>).</p>

As I mentioned above, the charge was delivered in English and translated sentence-by-sentence into Inuktitut. Indeed, the Crown has pointed out that even individual sentences were at times broken down to facilitate the translation.&nbsp; The transcription process is already reductionist in nature: the regular inflections in one’s voice, one’s emphasis on certain words and the natural flow of an idea or thought are not always captured by a written record.&nbsp; In the case of a trial conducted in two languages, the natural breaks between topics may not be as clear as usual, given the constant interruptions required for translation.&nbsp; The court reporter thus faced the difficult task of ensuring that the written record was true to the proceedings. The paragraph structure of the charge as set out in the transcript should not be read as necessarily reflecting the actual structure of the charge as presented at trial, particularly given that the instructions were delivered orally and were translated sentence-by-sentence for the jury.&nbsp; While an appellate court must certainly rely on transcripts as records of lower court hearings, their usefulness does not imply that the court should not examine them critically when necessary.&nbsp; A transcript is not an authoritative legal text.&nbsp;</p>

This is not a case in which the trial judge used a word or phrase that was reasonably capable of more than one meaning and the jury was left to discern which of the possible meanings was intended.&nbsp; When read in the context of the entire charge and of the evidence and the trial as a whole, the impugned statement has only one reasonable meaning.&nbsp; The possibility of an appellate court divining another interpretation of the trial judge’s words does not mean that the charge created uncertainty for the jury.</p>

Paré</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 618; <i>R. v. Chartrand</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, at pp. 881-82; <i>R. v. Mac</i>, 2002 SCC 24, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 856, at para. 4). Even if the impugned statement in the instant case <i>did </i>disclose a true ambiguity, an attempt would first have to be made to resolve it by resort to general principles and methods of interpretation. For the reasons I have given above, an ambiguity in the charge should not automatically be resolved in favour of the accused.&nbsp;</p>

Arcangioli</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, at p. 145; <i>R. v. Marinaro</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 462; <i>R. v. Peavoy </i>(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 620 (C.A.), at p.&nbsp;631), it can be used, more generally, to impugn the accused person’s credibility (<i>R. v. White</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, at para. 26).&nbsp;</p>

Pharr</i>, 2007 ONCA 551, 227 O.A.C. 112, at paras. 8-15; <i>Peavoy</i>, at pp. 630-31) or the “not criminally responsible” defence under s. 16 (<i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at paras. 42-53).&nbsp; In the case at bar, the Crown could have pursued the argument that the appellant’s sense of awareness immediately after the shooting was relevant circumstantial evidence that he had the requisite intent, since it belied his claim to have been completely disoriented by the pepper spray.&nbsp; If the Crown had done so, then the jury should have been instructed on the limited probative value of the appellant’s post-offence conduct.&nbsp; However, the Crown did not make this argument at trial, and the trial judge did not allude to it in his charge to the jury.&nbsp; There is obviously no need for a judge to include a limiting instruction pertaining to an issue that did not even arise in the case.&nbsp; This would have unnecessarily confused the jury and might have amounted to an error in its own right.</p>

Trochym</i>, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239).&nbsp; In essence, this provision allows a court to uphold a conviction despite an error of law if no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the error.&nbsp; The Crown must demonstrate to the court either (1) that the error was so harmless, and so insignificant, that it could not have affected the verdict; or (2) that the error, while serious, did not result in a miscarriage of justice or a substantial wrong, because the case against the accused was so overwhelming that a conviction would have been inevitable even if the error had not been made.</p>

Seewald as evidence of intent.</p>

Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at pp. 1319‑20).&nbsp; It is the judge, and not counsel, who is ultimately responsible for the adequacy of the charge.&nbsp; At the same time, a failure to object does merit consideration by the reviewing court (<i>Jacquard</i>, at paras. 37-38; <i>R. v. Daley</i>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para.&nbsp;58).&nbsp; In the case at bar, the fact that defence counsel did not object suggests that the “error”, had it in fact been an error, would have been neither serious nor significant.</p>

Once legal error was established, the burden was <i>on the Crown </i>to persuade the court that<i> no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred</i>.&nbsp; The appellant, having established error, was not bound to establish the contrary.&nbsp;</p>

Seewald, but also the evidence of the Crown’s own witness as to the potential effect of pepper spray on the appellant’s mental state, and the fact that the shooting occurred in the course of a struggle during which both the constable and the appellant had both hands on the weapon.</p>

Trochym</i>, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, the Court emphasized the very high threshold that the “overwhelming” standard imports.&nbsp; Justice Deschamps, writing for the majority, explained at para. 82 that the “overwhelming standard” “is a substantially higher one than the requirement that the Crown prove its case ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ at trial”.&nbsp; As Justice Deschamps noted, this “higher standard” reflects the difficulties that appellate courts face when considering “retroactively the effect that, for example, excluding certain evidence could reasonably have had on the outcome”.&nbsp; This will particularly be the case for jury trials where “no detailed findings of fact will have been made” (para. 82).&nbsp;</p>
