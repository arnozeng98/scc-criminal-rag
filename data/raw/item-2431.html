   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Accused unsuccessfully appealed his conviction of possessing heroin for the purpose of trafficking to the Quebec Court of Appeal. The appeal to this Court was on two grounds: (1) the lack of jurisdiction in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace to try the accused due to the fact that he had not validly re-elected for a trial by judge alone and (2) the trial judge's error in convicting the accused without offering him the opportunity to address the issue of "purpose" after having made a finding that he was in possession of the narcotic in light of the provisions of s. 8 of the <i>Narcotic Control Act.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held: </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">The appeal should be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">A party may waive a procedural requirement enacted for his benefit. The validity of any waiver, however, is dependent upon it being clear and unequivocal, <i>i.e. </i>that the person is waiving the procedural safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will have on those rights in the process.

N-1) by a judge of the Sessions of the Peace, sitting in the judicial district of Montreal as a judge under Part XVI of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Criminal Code.</span></i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Korponay's appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal was dismissed and he now comes to this Court on two grounds: his first ground is that, having chosen originally a trial by jury, the Court that convicted him did not have jurisdiction to do so because he had not been properly put to a</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">re-election to the latter court under s. 492 of the <i>Criminal Code; </i>his second ground is predicated on the provisions of s. 8 of the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>which require that the court conducting a trial for an offence contrary to s. 4(2) of the <i>Narcotic Control Act </i>proceed in determining the guilt or innocence of an accused in two phases. The appellant argues that the trial judge did not proceed in compliance with the special procedure set out in s. 8, in that he did not make a finding as to possession and then give the accused an opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, and that, as a result, a new trial should be ordered. Appellant's first ground should not in my opinion succeed. However, as I am of the view that his second should, the issue raised by the first ground must nevertheless be decided as it is determinant of which court will have jurisdiction to hear the new trial that should in my opinion be ordered.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><u><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">First ground</span></u></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Korponay had elected, under s. 484(2) of the <i>Code, </i>to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. Following a preliminary inquiry he was, on September 22, 1972, committed for trial before the Superior Court of Criminal Jurisdiction.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Korponay, who was on bail, appeared before that Court on November 6, 1972, and his case was remanded from one assize to the other the last of such remands being to November 22, 1974.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">However, on November 6, 1974, we find Korponay, assisted by two attorneys, appearing before the Chief Judge of another court, the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, in Montreal. The relevance of this occurrence will become apparent later. The Clerk of that Court had the Superior Court's record and, in the presence of all, including the Crown Attorney, read the charge to Korponay. What then happened is best described by reproducing here the transcript of the proceedings:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The trial commenced on the date of that appearance before the Chief Judge by the reading into the record by consent of evidence adduced in other proceedings, against other persons involved in the events that gave rise to the charge against Korponay. The trial appears to have continued piece-meal on many occasions over the next three years. After the Crown finally closed its case, Korponay offered a defence and testified on his own behalf on May 5, 1977. On August 3 of the same year, Chief Judge Mayrand found him guilty and, on September 23, 1977 sentenced him to 14 years in the penitentiary.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">It was not until October 19, 1979, some two years later, that the appellant, in a petition for a writ of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">habeas corpus, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">questioned for the first time since the beginning of his trial in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace that Court's jurisdiction to try him.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">This appeal is not concerned with those proceedings but with the appeal from his conviction. His first ground alleges a lack of jurisdiction in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace to try him due to the fact that he had not validly re-elected for a trial by judge alone, and that the only court having jurisdiction for doing so was the court he had initially chosen, the Superior Court. Korponay says that the </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">provisions </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">set out in s. 492 for re-electing are mandatory, must be complied with strictly, and that substantial compliance with the provisions of that section is not sufficient to confer </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">upon </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">the court jurisdiction to try him.</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">492. (1) Where an accused has elected or is deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, the accused may notify the sheriff in the territorial division in which he is to be tried that he desires to re-elect under this section,</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">(a) to be tried by a judge without a jury; or</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">(b) if he has the consent in writing of the Attorney General or counsel acting on his behalf, to be tried by a magistrate without a jury.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) A sheriff who receives a notice and a consent, if required, pursuant to subsection (1) shall forthwith inform a judge or magistrate having jurisdiction and the judge or magistrate, as the case may be, shall fix a time and place for the accused to re-elect and shall cause notice thereof to be given to the accused,</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(3) The accused shall attend or, if he is in custody, shall be produced at the time and place fixed under subsection (2) and shall, after the charge upon which he has been committed for trial or ordered to stand trial has been read to him,</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">(a) if the notice states that the accused desires to re-elect to be tried by a judge without a jury, be put to his election in the following words:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">You have elected or are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. Do you now elect to be tried by a judge without a jury?;</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(5) Where an accused who desires to re-elect to be tried by a judge without a jury does not notify the sheriff in accordance with subsection (1) more than fourteen days before the day fixed for the opening of the sittings or session of the court sitting with a jury by which he is to be tried, no election may be made under</span></p>

12.0pt"> 48]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">this section unless the Attorney General or counsel acting on his behalf consents in writing.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The appellant says that no notice was given by him to the sheriff, that no notice was given him by the judge, and that he was not read the words set out in s. 492(3)(a). He concludes that, this not having been done, the judge did not have the jurisdiction to proceed to trial as he did.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">All of appellant's arguments in his factum and before this Court related to whether there was or was not strict compliance with the section and were then in support of a requirement for strict compliance.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In my view there was no compliance with the section at all, not even substantial compliance, and the issue whether there must be strict or need only be substantial compliance is of no relevance to the determination of this case. What the procedures followed in this case raise as an issue is whether an accused may waive compliance with the procedural requirements set out in the section, if so, in what manner, and whether the accused in this case did waive them.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Some procedural requirements are enacted for the protection of the rights of one of the parties, Crown and accused, and others for both. A party may waive a procedural requirement enacted for his benefit, the concurrence of both being required when enacted for both. Generally speaking, the right to waive that type of procedural requirement has been recognized by all the courts, including this Court, and has been recently reaffirmed by this Court's decision as regards the waiver of a </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">voir dire </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">into the circumstances surrounding the giving of a statement by an accused to a person in authority (see </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Park v. The Queen, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">[1981] <i><span style="letter-spacing:.4pt">2 S.C.R. </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">64). Paramount to such a right is that of the trial judge to require compliance notwithstanding a desire to waive, he being the ultimate judge of what procedural safeguards need nevertheless be respected in order to protect the certainty and the integrity of the judicial process.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 49]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">When one looks at the various cases dealing with waiver, the problem which presents itself relates to what formalities should surround a waiver before the court should accept it and give it effect, in order that it will be a bar to the party seeking to assert a non-compliance with the procedural requirement.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">As a general proposition, I should like to restate here what was said by our brother Dickson J., speaking for the Court, in <i>Park, supra. </i>He was of course speaking of the waiver by counsel of a </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:.4pt">voir </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">dire </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[at pp. 73-74]:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">No particular words or formula need be uttered by <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">defence counsel to express the waiver and admission. All</span> that is necessary is that the trial judge be satisfied that counsel understand the matter and has made an informed decision to waive the <i>voir dire. [...</i></span><i><span lang="FR-CA">]</span></i></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Although no particular form of words is necessary the waiver must be express. Silence or mere lack of objection does not constitute a lawful waiver. The question is—does the accused indeed waive the requirement of a <i>voir dire </i>and admit that the statement is voluntary and <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">admissible in evidence? If that question can be answered</span> in the affirmative I cannot think that any further procedural safeguards are necessary to protect the rights of an accused person.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Indeed </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:1.55pt">the</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> Court is saying in <i>Park </i>that the validity of such a waiver, and I should add that that is so of any waiver, is dependent upon it being <u>clear and unequivocal that the person is waiving</u> <u>the procedural safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will have on</u> <u>those rights in the process.</u> This has long been recognized, as is illustrated by many cases, and particularly so by those dealing with a judge's duties as regards a plea of guilty, which is the waiver by an accused of his right to put the Crown's case to the test of a trial. (See amongst others, <i>Adgey v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426; Brosseau v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. </i>181). The judge's duties concerning any waiver are no different than those on a plea of guilty. The factors he will take into account in determining whether the accused has clearly and unequivocally made an informed decision to waive his rights will vary</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 50]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">depending on the nature of the procedural requirement being waived and the importance of the right it was enacted to protect. However, always relevant will be the fact that the accused is or is not represented by counsel, counsel's experience, and, in my view of great importance in a country so varied as ours, the particular practice that has developed in the jurisdiction where the events are taking place.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">I will now consider those principles as they apply to the procedural requirements of s. 492.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">First let us look at the notice that an accused may give to the sheriff. To identify the right of the accused Parliament intended to protect through this procedure one must look at the purpose of the notice. That purpose is revealed by the fact that it creates an obligation upon the sheriff to "forthwith inform" the judge who in turn "shall fix a time and place for the accused to re-elect" and then "cause notice thereof to be given to the accused".</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The right to be protected by the procedural enactment is that of the accused, wishing to re-elect, to have a timely opportunity to do so. He is entitled to have the judge informed of his wish, and thus require the judge to act under the section. An accused who has in fact acted on that opportunity cannot later complain that the notice requirement needed waiver by him as it obviously, in those circumstances, no longer had any purpose.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">As for the notice that the judge must give the accused, it is to ensure that he will know where and when to attend to re-elect. An accused who does in fact agree to a time and place to attend would clearly and unequivocally be waiving that notice.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The procedural step set out in s. 492(3), requiring the use of certain words, is there to ensure that an accused is properly informed of the choice he has made and the one he now proposes to adopt. His alternatives in the case at bar would be trial by a court composed of a judge and jury, which he has formerly chosen, or trial by judge or magistrate</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 51]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">alone, which he then contemplated. An informed waiver must therefore be, as regards that portion of s. 492, a clear and unequivocal indication by the accused himself or through his counsel that he knows the words that the law says must be used when putting him to his re-election, that he does not require that those words be uttered to him, that he knows he was going to have a trial before a judge and jury, that he still has the right to such a trial but that he still has the right to re-elect for a trial before a judge sitting without a jury or a magistrate.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Now to apply these considerations to the facts of the present case.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The events took place in the judicial district of Montreal. Pursuant to questions by this Court at the hearing, attorney for the appellant acknowledged the existence of a practice particular to that district as regards re-election. (See: <i>Traité de </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">procédure <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">pénale, vol. </span></span></i><span lang="EN-CA">1, <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">1981, by Béliveau, Bellemare and Lussier, at pp. 302-308). As appears from that book, an accused, who has elected for a trial by jury and who wishes to re-elect for a trial by judge alone, does not advise the sheriff of same but rather a particular clerk of the court who is known as being currently the person responsible for re-elections. If the re-election is to be made at a date prior to the date the accused was told to be present before the Assizes Court at his last appearance before that Court, that clerk, having been so advised by accused's counsel, arranges for an appearance before the Chief Judge of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace (or any judge replacing him for that purpose) for re-election. This is usually done in the absence of the Crown Prosecutor who is handling the case, unless there is some special reason for his being present, such as a plea of guilty followed by pre-sentence representations, or evidently unless, as in this case, the trial is to commence at that time by the reading into the record of evidence already adduced in other procedures.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">That this be the practice in the judicial district of Montreal, appellant does not contest. He ques</span><span lang="EN-CA">tions</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 52]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">however the validity of that practice as not being in accordance with s. 492. In this case, the accused with his attorney, the Crown attorney and the clerk were in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace before the Chief Judge of that Court. The record, which was the Superior Court's record by virtue of the appellant's original election, had been brought to that Court and the clerk had read the charge to Korponay and asked him whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty. To that, the accused's attorney replied "judge alone". It is clear from the exchange that ensued that the Crown, and probably the court clerk, were under the mistaken impression that the accused had already re-elected to that Court and was there to commence the trial, which is what eventually happened.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is equally clear that appellant's attorney and appellant himself were there to commence the trial before that Court and that the attorney for the appellant, being of the view, and rightly so, that there had not been a re-election, indicated to the judge in his client's name that he wanted to be tried by a judge alone. The judge had before him an attorney whose knowledge of the law and of the practice of the criminal law does not appear to be in issue. He was, in my view, amply justified in assuming, since everyone was there to proceed with the trial, that the attorney had discussed the matter with Korponay and that Korponay made an informed decision, on the advice of his attorney, to proceed to trial, not before a jury, but before that judge sitting without a jury, and that the attorney was fully authorized to do anything necessary to that end. The judge was therefore in my view amply justified in considering that the attorney's saying "judge alone" was an informed waiver of the requirement of putting to his client the words of the section. The accused's attorney knew what those words were, he knew what they meant and what effect his answer "judge alone" would have on his client's rights. Also, I should like to make my own the words of Monnin J. A. when, speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in the case of R. </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">v. <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Matheson </span></span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(1979), 13 </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.1pt">C.R. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(3d) 62, (the decision was reversed by this Court<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[1]</span></span></span></a></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 53]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">but for reasons irrelevant to the passage that I am quoting with approval), he said (at p. 71):</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am of the view that what the accused can personally do counsel speaking on his behalf and in his presence <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">can likewise do; otherwise we are diminishing the role of</span> counsel and making a mockery of open trials solemnly conducted in the presence of the accused fully represented by counsel of his choice. It is certainly more expeditious and free from doubt to let a person who is trained and learned in the law inform the court of the <span style="letter-spacing:
-.15pt">election and the plea of the accused, providing it is done</span> in open court and in the hearing of the accused, rather that </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.9pt">[sic] </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">to insist that a slow and tedious trial ritual be accomplished only through the mouth of the accused, who may not fully understand the questions raised and <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">who may be hesitant to reply for fear of misunderstand</span>ing or mistake. Counsel has a role to play in the courtroom. He should be able to play it to the fullest.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This is a case of a clear and unequivocal waiver by the accused through his attorney of the uttering of the words set out in the section. The attorney thought the accused had not re-elected, was right in thinking so and did re-elect for the purpose of getting on with what everyone was there to do: start the trial. As for his "notice" to the sheriff, I think that what I have already said on the matter is sufficient. He was being offered the choice the notice was enacted to ensure, and that procedure would have been superfluous and needed not be waived.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This also disposes of notice from the judge. In any event it is also evident that all there had agreed to a time, place and purpose, and that it would be extravagant to even suggest that there was not a clear and unequivocal waiver of that requirement.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">After the Crown closed its case, Korponay, on May 5, 1977, testified and then closed his defence. The trial judge set August 3 for judgment. On that date, Korponay and three other accused, who had been charged on different records with two counts, conspiracy to traffic in a narcotic, and trafficking, appeared before him for judgment. Korponay had been tried separately. Evidence adduced at the trials of the others had been read into Korponay's trial. The trial judge was pronouncing judgment of all four accused on the same day for they were all part of the same illegal transaction though charged differently and not tried with Korponay. This is of some relevance in understanding what I consider to be but an unfortunate oversight on the judge's part, he being well cognizant of the exceptional procedure to be followed on a trial governed by s. 8 of the <i>Narcotic Control Act. </i>In a written judgment, which he read, he concluded by finding all of them guilty as charged. He had evidently momentarily overlooked the special position Korponay was in and as a result did not in any way comply with the procedure set out in s. 8, make a</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In my opinion the Appellant has failed to justify his<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>grounds of appeal.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">This to me is, with deference, a misunderstanding of the rights of an accused at a trial governed by s. 8 of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Narcotic Control Act.</span></i></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Under s. 8, the rights of an accused are fourfold:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The respondent—Crown is saying that a breach of the accused's right to a finding by the judge before addressing the issue of the purpose of his possession is necessarily cured by the accused having in fact been given at some time prior to that finding an opportunity to address the issue and by his having availed himself of that opportunity.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The accused's right is not limited to that of being given an opportunity of establishing that the purpose of his possession was not trafficking; were that the case, I would agree with the Crown that the accused having testified as to that aspect of the offence, s. 613(1)(b)(iii) could, given the proper circumstances, be applied and cure the oversight with respect to the second stage of s. 8.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 57]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Such is not however the case because most important is the additional right of an accused to avail himself of that opportunity, or decide not to, only after having been given the trier of fact's finding as to possession and only if that finding is adverse. The question therefore, as regards the application of </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">s. </span><span lang="EN-CA">613(1)</span><span lang="EN-CA"></span><span lang="EN-CA">(b)(iii), <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">is whether the Crown has discharged the burden of satisfying the court that even if the accused had known that the finding would be adverse to him his defence would have been necessarily the same. I find it difficult to imagine a court ever being so satisfied. Indeed, an accused's whole approach to his case might well be very different at that second stage of the proceedings. Let me illustrate. An accused is perfectly entitled, by his not testifying himself in his own defence though offering a defence at the first stage of the proceedings, to refrain from revealing an addiction to drugs which could be incriminating as regards possession. He might however want to establish that fact at the second stage of the proceedings when contending that the purpose of his possession was for personal consumption. This example illustrates the general proposition that a court cannot know that a defence after the finding would necessarily have been the same as that advanced before and conclude that there was "no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice".</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In my view, the curative provisions of </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">s. </span><span lang="EN-CA">613(1)</span><span lang="EN-CA"></span><span lang="EN-CA">(b)(iii) <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">can never succeed in face of this type of error.

The Court of Appeal of Quebec dismissed the appeal by applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii). As I said earlier, I do not think that s. 613 can have any application where the provisions of s. 8 have not been complied with. But, the fact that Sylvain, assisted by his attorney, and in answer to questions by his attorney, started by admitting possession and then dealt directly with "purpose" was, in the circumstances of that case, in my opinion, a clear and unequivocal waiver of his right to a "finding" on possession by the judge before testifying as to purpose.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Sharpe </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">case appears to have been decided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario by resorting to a combination of "waiver" and the provisions of s. 613.
