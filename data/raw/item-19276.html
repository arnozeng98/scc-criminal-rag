   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2016, V was convicted of fraud, trafficking and theft in respect of maple syrup. The stolen maple syrup, which had a market value of over $18,000,000, passed through the hands of several individuals before it was resold by V, who collected the income and paid his various accomplices. By V’s own admission, he earned $10,000,000 in income from the resale of the syrup obtained by theft or fraud and made a personal profit of nearly $1,000,000, minus certain transportation costs.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under s.&nbsp;462.37(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the trial judge imposed a fine on V in lieu of an order for forfeiture of property that was proceeds of crime (“fine in lieu”). Because the trial judge was of the opinion that he had no choice but to impose a fine equal to the value of the property that was proceeds of crime and that had been in V’s possession or under his control, he ordered V to pay a fine corresponding to the resale value of the maple syrup obtained by theft or fraud, that is, $10,000,000, minus the amount of a restitution order. However, the Court of Appeal reduced that amount to the profit made by V, $1,000,000, minus the amount of the restitution order. It held that courts have the discretion to impose a fine that reflects the profit made from a criminal activity, provided that this penalty meets the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence. It was of the view that the fine imposed on V by the trial judge was clearly disproportionate to the objectives of the scheme governing this type of fine and that it created a situation of double recovery in light of the fines imposed on V’s accomplices.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: The appeal should be allowed.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V must be required to pay a fine equal to the value of the property that was in his possession or under his control, that is, $10,000,000, as the trial judge found. This amount is warranted in light of the scheme for the forfeiture of proceeds of crime, under which a fine must, in principle, be equal to the value of the property of which an offender had possession or control at some point in time. Because a court does not have the discretion to limit the amount of a fine in lieu to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities, the Court of Appeal assumed a discretion it did not have when it reduced V’s fine. Moreover, V did not prove either at trial or on appeal that there was a risk of double recovery of the $10,000,000.</p>
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</span> fine in lieu differs from the sentence imposed for the commission of a designated offence in that its purpose is to replace the proceeds of crime rather than to punish the offender<span style="line-height:200%">. It is therefore in the nature of a forfeiture order. </span>The imposition of a fine in lieu may be considered where forfeiture of the property that is proceeds of crime has become impracticable. In such a case, a court may, instead of ordering the forfeiture of the property, order the offender to pay a fine equal to the value of the property, as provided for in s.&nbsp;462.37(3) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i></p>

200%">. </span>The definition of the term “property” in s.&nbsp;2 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> is broad enough to capture gross income derived from the sale of property obtained by crime<span style="line-height:200%">. Furthermore, a </span>court that limited the scope of a fine to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities would be disregarding the nature of this order, which serves as a substitute where forfeiture of the property has become impracticable. Equivalency between the amount of the fine and the value of the property is inherent in the notion of substitution<span style="line-height:
200%">. Lastly,</span> limiting a fine in lieu to an offender’s profit undermines and disregards what Parliament intended. The dual objective of such an order is to deprive an offender of the proceeds of their crime and to deter them, as well as potential accomplices and criminal organizations, from reoffending. Through the severity of the proceeds of crime provisions, Parliament is sending a clear message that crime does not pay and is thus attempting to discourage individuals from organizing themselves and committing profit‑driven crimes. Parliament’s decision that the fine must correspond to the value of the property is therefore deliberately harsh.</p>

An offender’s ability to pay must not be considered in determining the amount of a fine in lieu, any more than in deciding whether or not to impose such a fine<span style="line-height:200%">.</span></p>

However, given the approximate nature of the exercise, the court retains some flexibility in deciding how the value of the property will be apportioned between the co‑accused.</p>

The Crown should discharge this duty in every case, but especially where the co‑accused are tried separately, because it has an overview of the various proceedings and can limit up front the amount it seeks as a fine in lieu in each proceeding in order to ensure that the total of the fines imposed on the co‑accused corresponds to the value of the property that is proceeds of crime.</p>

In particular, this Court must determine whether a court has the discretion to limit the amount of a fine in lieu to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities and must delineate the circumstances in which a court may apportion between co‑accused the value of property that is proceeds of crime. This appeal serves, incidentally, as an occasion for this Court to reaffirm that a fine in lieu is ordered as a substitute for forfeiture and not as a punishment for the commission of an offence, although the fine is part of the sentencing process.</p>

At trial, Mr.&nbsp;Vallières was convicted of fraud, trafficking and theft in respect of maple syrup belonging to the Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec (“Federation”). The Crown’s appeal is limited to the fine in lieu imposed on Mr.&nbsp;Vallières at sentencing. The trial judge imposed a fine in lieu corresponding to the resale value of the maple syrup obtained by theft or fraud, but the Quebec Court of Appeal reduced that amount to the profit made by Mr.&nbsp;Vallières. In both cases, the amount of a restitution order was subtracted from the fine. For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal erred.</p>

Together, they planned to steal maple syrup from one of the Federation’s warehouses and resell it on the black market.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

Mr.&nbsp;Caron and his accomplices surreptitiously took barrels of maple syrup, emptied them and filled them with water. The maple syrup thereby stolen from the Federation was then transferred to other barrels or plastic containers, which were transported in 53‑foot tractor‑trailers. The transport operations were overseen by another accomplice, Sébastien Jutras. Mr.&nbsp;Vallières purchased the syrup directly from Mr.&nbsp;Caron and exported it outside Quebec, including to New Brunswick, where his co‑accused Étienne St‑Pierre carried on business.</p>

In this regard, 6 of his 16 accomplices were ordered to pay fines in lieu, in amounts ranging from $9,840 to $1,200,000.</p>

At the sentencing stage, the Crown sought, among other things, a fine in lieu of $9,393,498.44 payable within 8 years.</p>

Finding that Mr.&nbsp;Vallières had profited from the crimes he had committed with other individuals, which had taken place over a lengthy period of time, the trial judge concluded that a fine in lieu therefore had to be imposed on him. Although the evidence established that the Federation had incurred a financial loss exceeding $18,000,000, the judge, relying on the admission made by Mr.&nbsp;Vallières, determined that he had had in his possession at least $10,000,000 from the resale of the syrup obtained by theft or fraud.</p>

Because the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.&nbsp;Vallières had received $10,000,000 from the theft, fraud and trafficking he had committed, the judge found that he had no choice but to order the payment of that amount as a fine in lieu. From the $10,000,000, he subtracted $606,501.56, which was the amount of a restitution order.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">[1]</span></sup></span></sup></span></a> Mr.&nbsp;Vallières was subject to a 6‑year term of imprisonment if he failed to pay the fine in lieu within 10 years.</p>

In its view, the syrup sold by Mr.&nbsp;Vallières during the offence period had been obtained either by theft from the Federation or in fraud of its rights, designated offences of which he had been convicted. All of the income generated by Mr.&nbsp;Vallières during that period — $10,000,000, which he admitted — was therefore proceeds of crime.</p>

Although a fine in lieu is technically part of a sentence pursuant to s.&nbsp;673 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>, such an order differs from the sentence imposed for the commission of a designated offence in that its purpose is to replace the proceeds of crime rather than to punish the offender (<i>R. v. Lavigne</i>, 2006 SCC 10, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 392, at para.&nbsp;25). A fine in lieu is therefore, first and foremost, in the nature of a forfeiture order. It has consistently been held that the forfeiture inquiry is independent of the broader inquiry undertaken with respect to sentencing and the principles related thereto (<i>Lavigne</i>, at paras.&nbsp;25‑26; <i>R. v. Craig</i>, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 762, at paras.&nbsp;34‑37; <i>R. v. Ouellette</i>, 2009 SCC 24, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 818, at para.&nbsp;2; <i>R. v. Nguyen</i>, 2009 SCC 25, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 826, at para.&nbsp;2). It is therefore imperative that, when calculating the amount of a fine in lieu, courts put aside the general principles of sentencing that are incompatible with the nature of this order.</p>

This term is defined broadly (<i>R. v. Dwyer</i>, 2013 ONCA 34, 296 C.C.C. (3d) 193, at para.&nbsp;21). It means “any property, benefit or advantage .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. obtained or derived directly or indirectly as a result of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the commission .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of a designated offence” (s.&nbsp;462.3(1) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>). A “designated offence” is “any offence that may be prosecuted as an indictable offence under [the <i>Criminal Code</i>] or any other Act of Parliament, other than an indictable offence prescribed by regulation” (s.&nbsp;462.3(1) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>). In this case, the designated offences of which Mr.&nbsp;Vallières was convicted are theft, fraud and trafficking in property obtained by crime, all of which concerned property with a value of more than $5,000.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par26">26</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The imposition of a fine in lieu may be considered where forfeiture of the property that is proceeds of crime has become impracticable. In such a case, a court may, instead of ordering the forfeiture of the property, order the offender to pay a fine equal to the value of the property (s.&nbsp;462.37(3) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>). Although the use of the word “may” indicates that Parliament intended courts to have some discretion, I am of the view that this discretion does not allow them to limit the amount of a fine in lieu to the profit made from a criminal activity, even in cases where this would be consistent with the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence. I will explain why.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par27">27</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the wording of s.&nbsp;462.37(3) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> is categorical with respect to the amount of the fine. As this Court stated in <i>Lavigne</i>, “[t]he words are crystal clear. Parliament has itself determined the amount of the fine” (para.&nbsp;34). The fine is “equal to the value of the property” that is proceeds of crime (para.&nbsp;35; <i>R. v. Rafilovich</i>, 2019 SCC 51, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 838, at para.&nbsp;33).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par28">28</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the term “proceeds of crime” encompasses not only property but also any “benefit” or “advantage” (s.&nbsp;462.3(1) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>). The inclusion of these words in the definition of “proceeds of crime” can be explained by the fact that certain designated offences, such as fraud on the government (s.&nbsp;121(1) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>) and municipal corruption (s.&nbsp;123(1) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>), involve, among other things, the offer or acceptance of an “advantage” or “benefit”. However, the fine in lieu provision is limited to the concept of “property”, and the value of the property in question dictates the amount of the fine.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par29">29</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The term “property” as defined in the <i>Criminal Code</i> includes “property originally in the possession or under the control of any person, and any property into or for which it has been converted or exchanged and anything acquired at any time by the conversion or exchange” (s.&nbsp;2 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>). This definition is broad enough to capture gross income derived from the sale of property obtained by crime (see <i>R. v. Way</i>, 2017 ONCA 754, 140 O.R. (3d) 309, at paras.&nbsp;4‑7). In the words of R.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Hubbard et al., “[t]he concept should clearly encompass all proceeds of crime not just those remaining after deducting expenses” (<i>Money Laundering &amp; Proceeds of Crime</i> (2004), at p.&nbsp;442). Moreover, distinguishing between an offender’s income and expenses in order to determine the offender’s profit margin would essentially amount to legitimating criminal activity. But Parliament specifically enacted s.&nbsp;462.37(3) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> to deprive offenders of the fruits of their crimes and to take away any motivation for them to pursue their criminal purposes.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par30">30</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, a court that limited the scope of a fine to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities would be disregarding the nature of this order. It is only where forfeiture of property is impracticable that a fine may be ordered as a substitute (<i>R. v. Angelis</i>, 2016 ONCA 675, 133 O.R. (3d) 575, at para.&nbsp;72; <i>R. v. Ford</i>, 2013 NBCA 63, 412 N.B.R. (2d) 196, at para.&nbsp;5). Equivalency between the amount of the fine and the value of the property is inherent in the notion of substitution (<i>Lavigne</i>, at para.&nbsp;35).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

By way of analogy, in <i>R. v. Devloo and Ong</i>, 2018 MBQB 140, at paras.&nbsp;49‑51 (CanLII), the offender was ordered to pay a fine in lieu of $212,000, which corresponded to the amounts received in exchange for drugs. The offender’s profit was only $4,000, as the balance had been redistributed to other members of the criminal organization. The trial court nonetheless refused to limit the amount of the fine to $4,000 in the absence of evidence establishing an allocation of benefits between the offender and his co‑accused, and that decision was correctly affirmed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal (<i>R. v. Devloo</i>, 2020 MBCA 3, 384 C.C.C. (3d) 288, at para.&nbsp;92).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

German notes that “[t]he arrest of one player resembles ‘spin the bottle’, with the bottle facing a person who ends up being responsible for the gross value of the drugs, while other persons in the organization, not arrested, do not share the burden” (<i>Proceeds of Crime and Money Laundering: Includes Analysis of Civil Forfeiture and Terrorist Financing Legislation</i> (loose‑leaf), at §&nbsp;15:28). This seemingly harsh result stems from the nature of a fine in lieu: if the drugs had been found in the offender’s hands, they would have been forfeited in their entirety (§&nbsp;15:28).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par33">33</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, limiting a fine in lieu to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities undermines and disregards what Parliament intended (<i>R. v. Banayos and Banayos</i>, 2018 MBCA 86, 365 C.C.C. (3d) 528, at para.&nbsp;64). As this Court stated in <i>Quebec (Attorney General) v. Laroche</i>, 2002 SCC 72, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 708, “[t]he legislative objective of Part XII.2 plainly goes beyond mere punishment of crime” (para.&nbsp;25; see also <i>Lavigne</i>, at para.&nbsp;25; <i>Dieckmann</i>, at para.&nbsp;88). A fine in lieu is not part of the global sentence imposed on an offender for the commission of a designated offence (<i>Lavigne</i>, at paras.&nbsp;25‑26; <i>R. v. Schoer</i>, 2019 ONCA 105, 371 C.C.C. (3d) 292, at para.&nbsp;93; <i>Angelis</i>, at para.&nbsp;44; <i>R. v. Dritsas</i>, 2015 MBCA 19, 315 Man. R. (2d) 205, at para.&nbsp;56; <i>R. v. Khatchatourov</i>, 2014 ONCA 464, 313 C.C.C. (3d) 94, at para.&nbsp;55). It follows that the amount of the fine does not vary based on an offender’s degree of moral blameworthiness or the circumstances of the offence. Rather, the dual objective of the fine is to deprive an offender of the proceeds of their crime and to deter them from reoffending. But the objective of deterrence is not focused only on the actual offender: it also applies to potential accomplices and criminal organizations (<i>Lavigne</i>, at para.&nbsp;23).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par34">34</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through the severity of the proceeds of crime provisions, Parliament is sending a clear message that “crime does not pay” and is thus attempting to discourage individuals from organizing themselves and committing profit‑driven crimes. In <i>Lavigne</i>, Deschamps&nbsp;J. noted that “[t]he effectiveness of the adopted methods depends largely on the severity of the new provisions and on their deterrent effect” (para.&nbsp;9). Parliament’s decision that the fine must correspond to the value of the property is therefore deliberately harsh. Reducing a fine to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities would clearly be contrary to this objective.</p>

The Crown does not have to prove that the offender personally benefited from the proceeds of crime (<i>R. v. Piccinini</i>, 2015 ONCA 446, at para.&nbsp;19 (CanLII); <i>R. v. Siddiqi</i>, 2015 ONCA 374, at para.&nbsp;6 (CanLII)). Nor does the court have to consider the offender’s subsequent use of the property, such as how cash was spent by the offender (<i>Schoer</i>, at para.&nbsp;105; <i>R. v.

In a situation involving the resale of property obtained by crime, as in this case, the proceeds of crime are, in principle, the sum obtained in exchange for the property originally in the offender’s possession or under their control, in keeping with the definition of the word “property” in s.&nbsp;2 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C</i>. That sum is not necessarily equal to the market value of the property sold by the offender. It must be kept in mind that the purpose of a fine in lieu is to deprive an offender of the proceeds of their crime, not to compensate for the victim’s loss, which is the function of a restitution order (<i>R. v. Lawrence</i>, 2018 ONCA 676, at paras.&nbsp;14‑15 (CanLII)). Finally, an offender’s ability to pay must not be considered in determining the amount of a fine in lieu, any more than in deciding whether or not to impose a fine (<i>Rafilovich</i>, at para.&nbsp;32; <i>Lavigne</i>, at para.&nbsp;37).</p>

This Court has not previously considered whether, on an exceptional basis, an offender may be ordered to pay less than the total value of the property that was in their possession or under their control where several co‑accused had possession or control of the same property that constitutes proceeds of crime. More specifically, this case involves successive possession of the same property, namely the $10,000,000 that was in Mr.&nbsp;Vallières’s possession and under his control, only part of which he ultimately kept following a redistribution to his accomplices.</p>

This risk arises where the Crown seeks to have a fine in lieu imposed on more than one offender in relation to the same proceeds of crime. At the stage of imposing a fine in lieu, one can speak only of a “risk” of double recovery, for it may well be that this scenario will never materialize given the fact that some co‑accused might be unable to pay their fine within the time allotted. However, this possibility does not prevent a court from apportioning the fine between co‑accused if there is a risk of double recovery, if apportionment is requested by the offender and if the evidence allows this determination to be made.</p>

Second, such apportionment is consistent with the nature of an order substituting a fine for forfeiture. The imposition of a fine that exceeds the total value of the property, or of several fines that together do so, is incompatible with the idea that the fine is imposed instead of forfeiture.

The conditions under which a court may exercise its discretion to apportion are as follows.</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par44">44</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it is not enough for an offender to argue that they transferred the property to a third party in order to be entitled to apportionment. For the offender to raise a risk of double recovery, that third party must have been charged as well (<i>Siddiqi</i>, at para.&nbsp;6). The issue of double recovery obviously does not arise where the offender is the only person who stands trial (<i>Schoer</i>, at para.&nbsp;95, fn.&nbsp;2).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

There could be no actual risk of double recovery because the accomplices had died, but apportionment of the total amount of the fraud between the offender and her accomplices was nonetheless justified in the circumstances. The evidence showed that the proceeds of the fraud had been divided, the deceased accomplices were clearly guilty of the alleged offence and, above all, the Crown conceded that it would have apportioned the value of the property among the accomplices if they had stood trial.</p>

Lawlor</i>, 2021 ONCA 692, at para.&nbsp;27 (CanLII)). In <i>Dieckmann</i>, the Ontario Court of Appeal correctly stated that “if there is evidence before the court that establishes or admits of an allocation of benefit, it is open to the court to exercise its discretion to adjust the quantum of the fine” (para.&nbsp;100).</p>
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

Chung</i>, 2021 ONCA 188, 402 C.C.C. (3d) 145, the Ontario Court of Appeal, interpreting its own decision in <i>Dieckmann</i>, also stated the following:</p>
   <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where there are multiple offenders before the court, however, and the property passed through the hands of one offender to another without the first offender retaining the benefit of the full value of the property, the sentencing judge may allocate a portion of the fine less than the full value of the property that had been under the offender’s possession and control, <u>so long as the balance of the total value of the proceeds of crime are distributed to the other offenders before the court</u>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[Emphasis added; para.&nbsp;101.]</p>

In principle, an offender’s fine may be reduced only in proportion to the amount of the fines imposed on the offender’s co‑accused who are sentenced in the same proceeding, such that the total value of the property remains recoverable. This discretionary exercise is approximate in nature and is entitled to deference. For example, in <i>R. v. Sam</i> (1998), 163 Sask. R. 314, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal chose to allocate the total value of illicit substances equally between two co‑accused who had run a drug trafficking operation together (paras.&nbsp;15‑17).</p>

In such a situation, the court may consider the fines already imposed on the co‑accused if it is satisfied that they create a risk of double recovery of the same property. That being said, the fact that some co‑accused have not yet stood trial at the time an offender is sentenced should not deprive the offender of the benefit of apportionment. The court cannot foresee whether fines will be imposed on the offender’s co‑accused in the other proceedings or what their amount might be. To overcome this problem, the court need only find that the available evidence would have allowed it to impose a fine on the co‑accused if they had been before it, thereby justifying apportionment based on the risk of double recovery. In the end, the manner in which this discretion is exercised will depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>

The court has no choice but to proceed in this manner, because it must exercise its discretion in keeping with the nature of a fine in lieu, which replaces the property that cannot be forfeited, nothing more and nothing less. However, given the approximate nature of the exercise, the court retains some flexibility in deciding how the value of the property will be apportioned between the co‑accused.</p>

This is a duty that is part of the Crown’s “Minister of Justice” role, which excludes any notion of winning or losing (<i>R. v. Regan</i>, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para.&nbsp;65).</p>

As a result, the offender’s co‑accused may not rely on that amount to limit their own fines. As stated above, only where there is a possibility of double recovery can a court exercise its discretion to apportion, in keeping with the nature of a fine in lieu as a substitute for forfeiture. The amount of the fine is determined on the basis of the value of the property that can no longer be forfeited, not on the basis of considerations relating to fairness or an offender’s ability to pay.</p>

The eight‑year term of imprisonment was the punishment imposed on Mr.&nbsp;Vallières for the commission of the designated offences, whereas the fine was intended to replace the property whose forfeiture had become impracticable. The purpose of ordering a fine in lieu is not to punish an offender for the commission of an offence. The overall deterrent effect of a fine and a term of imprisonment therefore plays no role in determining the appropriate amount, which has been set by Parliament.</p>

That decision clearly indicates that the fine must correspond to the value of the property (<i>Lavigne</i>, at para.&nbsp;35). In that case, this Court ordered the offender to pay the $150,000 fine in lieu sought by the Crown because the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender had made at least that much from drug trafficking.

By his own admission, Mr.&nbsp;Vallières had control over that amount, which was in his hands or in his bank accounts at some point. From that moment on, the proceeds of crime provisions applied.

Considering, as a guide, that the value of the stolen syrup was over $18,000,000, the Crown could reasonably infer that Mr.&nbsp;Vallières, as the directing mind of the operation, had controlled an amount much greater than $10,204,400. Indeed, the evidence shows that Mr.&nbsp;Vallières had [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “at least $10,000,000” under his control (C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;176). The Crown could therefore legitimately seek such an amount from him without deliberately creating a risk of double recovery.</p>

Even though the amount of the fine in lieu may seem high, it is warranted in light of the scheme for the forfeiture of proceeds of crime.</p>

Suffice it to say that the determination of the amount of a fine in lieu involves different legal and factual considerations than the question of whether such a fine should be imposed on an offender, as this case shows. In such circumstances, a court should provide the parties with an opportunity to make submissions before deciding a question on which they have not had a chance to comment (<i>R. v. Mian</i>, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689).</p>

The fine imposed on Mr.&nbsp;Vallières is set at $9,171,397.57, that is, $10,000,000 minus the amount of the restitution order, $828,602.43. Mr.&nbsp;Vallières has 10 years to pay this fine, in default of which he is subject to imprisonment for 6 years consecutive to any other term of imprisonment.</p>
