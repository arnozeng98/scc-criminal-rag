(dissenting):&nbsp; The Court of Appeal erred in finding that the trial judge's report was authorized under s.&nbsp;682(1) of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; The section makes no provision for a report of a trial judge as was produced in this case.&nbsp; No request was made by the Court of Appeal for the report and the trial judge's comments pertained exclusively to evidence already in the record of the trial before the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; A report submitted on the trial judge's initiative, which does nothing more than elaborate on the evidence in the record in support of a conviction, is invalid under s.&nbsp;682(1).&nbsp; In any event, even if the report were valid, the trial judge's comments exceeded the bounds of what properly could be received and relied upon by the Court of Appeal in a s.&nbsp;682(1) report.&nbsp; Where a trial judge takes issue with the verdict of the jury, such a report cannot be taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; This would amount to nothing less than inviting the trial judge to enter the appellate arena.&nbsp; In the context of a jury trial, the jury's version of the findings of fact must prevail over that of the trial judge.&nbsp; The comments contemplated within a trial judge's report are comments relating to material issues not apparent on the face of the transcript, such as the demeanour of witnesses, the comportment of counsel, the behaviour of the jury and the general atmosphere of a trial.&nbsp; A Court of Appeal may, however, request a report on any matter pertaining to a trial which, in its view, requires elaboration.&nbsp; Here, the intent of the trial judge in submitting the report was to express his view that the verdict of the jury was unsafe.&nbsp; The s.&nbsp;682(1) report was not designed to provide trial judges with an open forum for impugning the findings of the jury and, assuming that the Court of Appeal had requested the trial judge's report, the contents of that report would amount to an improper interference by the trial judge in the appellate process, and should not have been relied upon.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeal erred in ordering a new trial on the ground&nbsp; that the verdict was unsafe.&nbsp; It is highly unlikely that the court would have concluded that the guilty verdict was unreasonable under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Code</i> were it not for the comments contained in the report.&nbsp; There was evidence in the testimony of the complainant and the other witnesses upon which the jury could have reasonably based a verdict of guilty.&nbsp; A physical examination of the complainant revealed findings consistent with the sexual abuse described by him.&nbsp; Given that the trial judge was satisfied that the complainant was of sufficient maturity to be sworn, and that his testimony was given in detail without significant internal inconsistencies, there was not a sufficient basis apart from the trial judge's report for the Court of Appeal to have found the verdict of the jury unsafe.</span></p>

The ability of the jury to arrive at a just verdict is enhanced where such comment is offered, so long as the trial judge emphasizes to the jury that they remain at liberty to disagree with his view.&nbsp; Where, as in this case, the ultimate verdict rests largely on the complainant's credibility, added prudence on the trial judge's part is necessary to ensure that the primacy of the jury as the trier of fact is not compromised.&nbsp; Thus, while the charge to the jury appears sound on its own, when it is read together with the subsequent trial judge's report accepted by the Court of Appeal it is clear that the trial judge misdirected himself in his charge to the jury.&nbsp; This is an error of law which cannot be ignored.&nbsp; This error cannot be cured by application of the proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; Had the trial judge not misdirected himself with respect to the ambit of his charge to the jury, given the centrality of credibility to the verdict, it is not possible to say that a properly instructed jury would necessarily have convicted.</span></p>

However, the report's having been made and received discloses an error of law which might have affected the verdict.&nbsp; This cannot be ignored.&nbsp; When considered in the absence of the trial judge's views as to the credibility of the complainant, the trial judge's comments in the charge on the problems that the jury should consider in assessing the complainant's evidence were fair.&nbsp; Nonetheless, but for an error of law, the trial judge would have added a comment with respect to the reliability of this evidence.&nbsp; For the reason given by Lamer&nbsp;C.J., the trial judge was entitled to make such a comment which would have enured to the benefit of the accused.&nbsp; Absent the error in law, the verdict would not necessarily have been the same.</span></p>

E. Popple surveyed the case law considering this provision of the <i>Code</i> and aptly concluded that "[i]t is obvious that this report is no ordinary document" (p. 56).&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to determine if the trial judge's report in the present case was properly furnished to the Court of Appeal, it is necessary to better understand the purpose behind these reports.&nbsp; Toward this end, it is useful to briefly review the history of the trial judge's report in the context of the development of criminal appeals in Canada.&nbsp; </span></p>

H. O'Halloran, "Development of the Right of Appeal in England in Criminal Cases" (1949), 27 <i>Can. Bar Rev.</i> 153, at pp. 157-58.</span></p>

(as he then was) held that a report submitted on the trial judge's initiative, which did nothing more than elaborate on the evidence in the record in support of a conviction, was invalid under s. 609(1) (now s. 682(1)).&nbsp; The section seems to me similarly unambiguous in such circumstances.&nbsp; </span></p>

(dissenting) acknowledged in the following statement that judges are provided with little guidance in this regard:&nbsp; "It is, I think, unfortunate that the section of the Code does not indicate more clearly the nature of the report to be made."&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the lack of certainty respecting Parliament's intent in enacting this provision, the case law has tended to shy away from clarifying the scope of the trial judge's report.&nbsp; A detailed review of this jurisprudence is found in I. Lagarde, <i>Droit pénal canadien</i> (2nd ed. 1974), after which the following instructive guidelines are offered regarding the contents of a trial judge's report (at p. 1661):</span></p>

Buxbaum</i> (1989), 70 C.R. (3d) 20, at p. 26, the Ontario Court of Appeal held, <i>per curiam</i>, that the trial judge had not erred in casting doubt on the credibility of the accused by posing, in his charge to the jury, a series of rhetorical questions designed to suggest a doubt to the jury regarding the accused's testimony.&nbsp; The court in that case elaborated the proper factors to consider in determining whether the trial judge had exceeded his or her discretion to offer a comment on the evidence in the charge to the jury: </span></p>

Newell</i>, [1941] O.W.N. 465, 77 C.C.C. 81 at 85-87, [1942] 1 D.L.R. 747 (C.A.).</span></p>

R. (D.J.)</i> (1991), 7 C.R. (4th) 300, the British Columbia Court of Appeal set aside a conviction on the grounds of an error by the trial judge in including comments on the credibility of a witness in his charge to the jury.&nbsp; The facts of that case are similar to the facts before us in the present appeal.&nbsp; The accused was alleged to have sexually assaulted the child of the woman with whom he was living.&nbsp; Credibility was, as it is here, the main factor in determining innocence or guilt of the accused.&nbsp; The jury had to choose between believing the evidence of the complainant (who was 13 at the time of trial and eleven at the time of the alleged incidents) and the evidence of the accused who had denied the allegations.&nbsp; In his charge, the trial judge offered the following comment on the complainant's testimony:</span></p>

The King</i>, [1931] S.C.R. 421.&nbsp; Where such comment is offered, and so long as the trial judge emphasizes to the jury that they remain at liberty to disagree with his or her view, I believe the ability of the jury to arrive at a just verdict is enhanced.&nbsp; </span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311.</span></p>

Barbeau</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 845, Cory J., writing for the Court, held that where the only defect in an indictment is the naming of the wrong offence, the error would render the indictment voidable but not void, as the two offences in that case were virtually identical. &nbsp;The same is true in this instance, and the same reasoning applies.&nbsp; I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeal's order granting the Crown leave to amend the indictment accordingly should the Crown proceed with a new trial.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I can see no "factual, legal or procedural argument triggered by the old offence or by the change of offence" which would affect the outcome of a new trial.&nbsp; Thus, I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal that the difference between the laws at the time of trial and the laws at the time of the offence constituted independent grounds for the ordering of a new trial.</span></p>

Barrow</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694; and <i>Vézina v.
