The mother later became dissatisfied with the limitations which the father was placing on her access to M and, in 1992, she applied to the Nova Scotia Family Court for custody and access.&nbsp; Pending the resolution of the matter, the Family Court ordered <i>ex parte</i> that the mother be granted ‚Äúinterim liberal access‚Äù and that M not be removed from Nova Scotia.&nbsp; Soon after being served with the interim order, the father left with M for California. The father was arrested two years later and, upon his return to Nova Scotia, was charged with abducting his child contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec283subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;283(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. That section makes it offence for a parent, guardian or lawful custodian of a child to take a child, not the subject of a custody order, with intent to deprive another parent or guardian or lawful custodian of the child of possession of that child.&nbsp; The father was acquitted at trial on the ground that he had not ‚Äútaken‚Äù M from his mother since, at all material times,&nbsp; M was legally in the father‚Äôs care.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 283 does not require that the deprived parent, guardian or other person having lawful care or charge of the child must actually have had possession of the child at the moment of the offence for an accused to be convicted.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp; Reading the English and French texts of s.&nbsp;283(1) together, a ‚Äútaking‚Äù or ‚Äú<i>enl√®vement</i>‚Äù occurs where the accused causes the child to come or go with him or her, and, in the process, excludes the authority of another person who has lawful care or charge of the child.&nbsp; Further,&nbsp; by also prohibiting acts such as ‚Äúconcealing‚Äù, ‚Äúharbouring‚Äù and ‚Äúreceiving‚Äù ‚Äî acts which can only be committed while the child is not in the possession of the deprived parent ‚Äî Parliament has indicated that child abduction by a parent, even in the absence of a custody order, can be found to have occurred regardless of whether the child was in the possession of the deprived parent at the relevant time. There is nothing in the <i>mens rea</i> of s.&nbsp;283(1) to suggest otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; An accused would have the requisite ‚Äúintent to deprive [the other parent] of the possession‚Äù if he or she intended to keep the other parent from having a possession to which he or she would otherwise be entitled.&nbsp; The word ‚Äúpossession‚Äù&nbsp; is not limited to circumstances in which the deprived parent is actually in physical control of the child at the time of the taking, but extends to the ability to exercise control over the child.&nbsp; By enacting ss.&nbsp;281 to 283,&nbsp; Parliament has decided that the protection of children rests in ensuring that people entitled to exercise care and control over children are able to do so.&nbsp; Accordingly, Parliament has criminalized conduct ‚Äî whether by a stranger or a parent, and whether or not there is a custody order in force ‚Äî that intentionally interferes with a parent‚Äôs lawful exercise of care and control over the children. An interpretation of s.&nbsp;283&nbsp; which does not require that the deprived parent have possession of the child at the moment of the offence&nbsp; is consistent with the purpose and scheme of the child abduction provisions.&nbsp; Such an interpretation does not have the effect of unduly expanding the scope of criminal liability, and elevating a deprivation of access to the status of criminal conduct.&nbsp; No accused will be convicted under s.&nbsp;283 unless he or she intended to deprive a person entitled to possession of the child of that possession.</span></p>

A parent‚Äôs statutory right to joint custody of her child should not be abrogated except in the clearest of terms.&nbsp; Therefore, as there was no order made by the court otherwise, there was no evidence before it that might upset the statutory presumption of joint care and custody.&nbsp; Both parents retained their entitlement to care and custody of the child.&nbsp; Consequently, it cannot be said, on the basis of the agreement, that the father did not take M from the possession of his mother.</span></p>

It is impossible, however, to say in advance whether such a condition should be found. The inquiry must be left to the trial judge.</span></p>

(dissenting):</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp; Section 283(1) of the <i>Code</i> targets the act of taking a child where there is no custody order in place. Certain conditions, however, must be fulfilled before the act of taking becomes criminal: the person taking must have lawful custody and the taking must be with the ‚Äúintent to deprive‚Äù the other parent ‚Äúof the possession of‚Äù the child. The section thus contemplates the situation where people share custody or ‚Äúpossession‚Äù of the child.&nbsp; Possession is used in the legal sense of right of possession.&nbsp; It is not necessary that the deprived parent have physical possession of the child at the time of the taking.&nbsp; What is required, at a minimum, is that the deprived parent have a right to possession of the child.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The central issue in this appeal is the effect of a custody agreement,&nbsp; as opposed to a court order, on a parent‚Äôs common law custody rights.&nbsp; A&nbsp; parent may give up his or her right to custody by entering into an agreement conferring sole custody on the other parent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the absence of a court order, a parent who does so no longer has a right to possession of the child of which he or she can&nbsp; be deprived, unless custody is restored by the termination of the agreement, a new agreement, or a court order.&nbsp; It follows that s.&nbsp;283(1) would find no application in a situation where sole custody has been conferred upon the ‚Äútaking‚Äù parent. It is unquestioned that common law rights, including the right to custody of a child, may be altered by contract.&nbsp; Here,&nbsp; the trial judge was correct in acquitting the father of the offence of child abduction.&nbsp; After the separation, the mother initially had a right to possession of the child at common law, as confirmed by the Nova Scotia <i>Family Maintenance&nbsp; Act</i>, but&nbsp; the trial judge found&nbsp; that the mother, by oral agreement with the father in December 1986, validly conveyed her common law right to possession and custody of the child to the father and that the agreement was still in force.&nbsp; These findings were&nbsp; amply supported by the evidence and should not have been disturbed by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp;The court erred in concluding that the agreement, as opposed to a court order, could not affect a parent‚Äôs original right to custody.&nbsp; Further, the father‚Äôs interference with the mother‚Äôs exercise of her access rights did not constitute a deprivation of possession under s.&nbsp;283(1). Possession, in contrast to access, comports the right and responsibility of care and control of the child.&nbsp; While&nbsp; the terms of access may be so generous that the non‚Äëcustodial spouse in fact exercises a significant degree of care and control over the child, the trial judge‚Äôs&nbsp; findings in this case&nbsp; negate any suggestion that the mother had any control or responsibility over the child.&nbsp; She had the right to visit the child; she did not have the control or responsibility for him required to establish possession.&nbsp; Finally, this Court should not rule on the issue of whether unregistered custody agreements may be of no force in Nova Scotia&nbsp; since&nbsp; this issue was not&nbsp; properly raised, considered and argued in this case. With respect to s.&nbsp;18(4) of the <i>Family Maintenance Act</i>,&nbsp; in the context of a criminal trial, the Crown bore the burden of showing that the father did not have an exclusive right of possession to the child at the time of taking.&nbsp; The Crown not having raised s.&nbsp;18(4) at trial, it is not for this Court at this stage of the proceedings to raise it to the end of discharging the burden that lay on the Crown.</span></p>

XVII, at p.&nbsp;564; see also D.&nbsp;Watt, <i>The New Offences Against the Person: The Provisions of Bill C-127</i> (1984), at p. 141.&nbsp; The verb ‚Äú<i>enlever</i>‚Äù, which appears in the French text, is somewhat more precise, as it connotes the action of ‚Äú<i>soustraire (une personne) √† l‚Äôautorit√© de ceux qui en ont la garde</i>‚Äù: <i>Le Grand Robert de la langue fran√ßaise</i> (2nd ed. 1986), t. III, at p. 1002.&nbsp; Reading the two texts together, I conclude that a ‚Äútaking‚Äù or ‚Äú<i>enl√®vement</i>‚Äù occurs where the accused causes the child to come or go with him or her, and, in the process, excludes the authority of another person who has lawful care or charge of the child.&nbsp; There is nothing in s. 283 to suggest that the deprived parent, guardian or other person having lawful care or charge of the child must actually have had possession of the child at the moment of the offence.&nbsp; Indeed, by also prohibiting acts such as ‚Äúconcealing‚Äù, ‚Äúharbouring‚Äù and ‚Äúreceiving‚Äù ‚Äî acts which can only be committed while the child is not in the possession of the deprived parent ‚Äî Parliament has indicated that child abduction by a parent, even in the absence of a custody order, can be found to have occurred regardless of whether the child was in the possession of the deprived parent at the relevant time.</span></p>

K.B.), an alleged abductor contended that ‚Äúshe could not be held guilty of taking away from her husband what he had not actually had, viz., the possession of the child, although he might be legally entitled to it‚Äù (p. 161).&nbsp;&nbsp; The court dismissed the argument, stating that when the statute spoke of the ‚Äúintent to deprive . . . of the possession‚Äù, it is not ‚Äúthe possession he <i>has</i> had of which the parent has been deprived, but of that to which he is <i>entitled</i>‚Äù (pp. 161-62 (emphasis in original)).</span></p>

To interpret s. 283(1) as requiring actual physical possession in the deprived parent at the time of taking&nbsp; is not required by the words of the section and would subvert its purpose of preventing one of two persons sharing custody or possession of a child from taking or keeping the child from the other parent without that parent‚Äôs consent.</span></p>

C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, would then be s. 282.</span></p>
