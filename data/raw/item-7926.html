In his charge to the jury, the trial judge referred to the accused’s post-offence conduct on two occasions, namely in the context of his instructions on the issue of intent where he stated: “You may consider [the accused’s] post-event conduct in fleeing the scene, but you should also be careful with it” and “it may not be of much assistance in assessing his precise state of mind at the time the gun was fired”, and in his summary of the Crown’s theory of the case.&nbsp; The accused was convicted as charged.&nbsp; On appeal, the accused argued that the trial judge should have specifically instructed the jury that the evidence concerning the circumstances of his flight had no probative value in relation to the issue of intent, because that evidence was consistent with both manslaughter and second degree murder.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, concluding that although the jury charge was deficient, the error was minor and could have no impact on the final verdict.&nbsp; The dissenting judge concluded that the trial judge had erred in failing to give a “no probative value” instruction.&nbsp; In his view, the error was serious such that it could not be saved by using the curative proviso found in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

Moreover, there is an important distinction to be made between a limiting instruction and a warning or caution. &nbsp;A limiting instruction tells the jury they must not consider the evidence for one or several purposes, and a warning or caution leaves the evidence for the jury to consider, but warns them to be careful with it.&nbsp; In the present case, the judge did warn the jury to be careful with the evidence relating to the accused’s flight and that there may be one or more explanations for his conduct.</span></p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">It was, however, appropriate for the trial judge to warn the jury to be careful with the post-event conduct evidence and tell them that it might not be of much assistance.&nbsp; Indeed, there could have been other explanations for the accused’s failure to hesitate.&nbsp; While the notion that a person who accidentally shoots someone to death will normally have the immediate reaction of hesitating or showing some other sign of surprise is well founded, there may be exceptional individuals who do not respond in the normal way.&nbsp; The caution was adequate to alert the jury to the risk associated with that evidence and to allow them to properly weigh it.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, if there was an error in the trial judge’s instructions, it should be saved by the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii).&nbsp; It would have been ideal for the trial judge, when instructing the jury on the matter of intent, to refer expressly and exclusively to the accused’s lack of hesitation, as opposed to his “conduct in fleeing the scene”.&nbsp; However, even assuming that the statement was persistently or intractably ambiguous and therefore constitutes an error, such an error is a minor one.&nbsp; There is no requirement for perfectly instructed juries, and given the nature of the purported error, it was unlikely to have had any effect on the jury’s deliberations.</span></p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is disagreement with Binnie&nbsp;J. on the significance he attaches to Crown counsel’s reference in his closing address to the fact that the accused immediately fled the scene “with no hesitation here, no shock, no uncertainty”.&nbsp; The Crown did not invite the jury to draw an impermissible inference of guilt.&nbsp; Taken in context, Crown counsel’s comment could only have been understood by the jury as a rhetorical argument that no evidence supported the defence theory of accidental discharge of the firearm.&nbsp; The failure of defence counsel to raise any issue at trial regarding Crown counsel’s closing address or the trial judge’s instructions on the evidence of flight further supports this interpretation.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also no support in the record for the accused’s contention, accepted by Binnie&nbsp;J., that this case is a re-run of <i>Arcangioli</i>.&nbsp; In that case, the accused admitted to participating in the culpable event and the only issue at trial was his level of culpability.&nbsp; Conversely, in the present case, the identity of the shooter was a very live issue and the evidence of flight was highly relevant to the issue of identification.&nbsp; Moreover, it formed an inextricable part of the narrative as every witness to the event described the shooter, gun in hand, fleeing the scene.&nbsp; The evidence was therefore admissible at trial and properly left for the jury’s assessment.&nbsp; The trial judge’s instructions regarding this evidence contained no error.&nbsp; The evidence of flight was reviewed for the jury in this context and its significance would have been properly understood.&nbsp; In addition, on the question of intention, the trial judge took care to instruct the jury that they should “be careful with” the evidence in question, as it might not tell them “much more than that for any number of reasons he would be in some kind of trouble if he stayed at the scene and it may not be of much assistance in assessing his precise state of mind at the time the gun was fired”.&nbsp; In the context of this trial, no more was required.&nbsp; Accordingly, there is agreement with Rothstein&nbsp;J. that the jury charge contained no error, and there is no reason to interfere with the jury’s verdict.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. and Binnie and Fish&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; The rules governing jury instructions where evidence relied on by the prosecution is not probative, or if probative is outweighed by unfair prejudice, are outlined in recent decisions in this Court in cases such as <i>Arcangioli</i> and <i>White</i>.&nbsp; The present case is not distinguishable in principle from <i>Arcangioli</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, as in <i>Arcangioli</i>, the conduct of the accused in the immediate aftermath of the offence was a significant element in the Crown’s argument to the jury, and in the trial judge’s final instructions.&nbsp; As well, there was the danger in this case that the jury might fail to take account of alternative explanations for the accused’s behaviour, and that they might mistakenly leap from such demeanour evidence to a conclusion of guilt.&nbsp; Had the issue of identity been put to the jury, undoubtedly evidence of flight would have been highly relevant.&nbsp; It might have been used by the jury, along with other evidence to find the accused to be the shooter.&nbsp; In the end, however, identity was admitted.&nbsp; Accordingly, the accused’s post-offence conduct was not simply put forward as part of the narrative; it was put forward as proof of guilt of second degree murder.&nbsp; On the basis of <i>Arcangioli</i>, that evidence was inadmissible to prove the specific intent necessary to support a conviction for murder.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of post-offence conduct is typical of many items of evidence adduced in a criminal trial:&nbsp; it is evidence of limited admissibility; the trier of fact may use it for one or more purposes but not for another.&nbsp; It follows that its introduction imposes on the trial judge in a jury trial the obligation to explain both the permitted and prohibited use of the evidence.&nbsp; The need will depend on the facts.&nbsp; One of the problems with evidence of post-offence conduct is that often the inferences sought are too equivocal for the evidence to be of any value.&nbsp; The question, as always, is the strength of the inferential link between the evidence in question and the fact sought to be established.&nbsp; If the evidence introduced in relation to a contentious issue has no probative value — or value that depends entirely on speculative or unreasonable inferences — it is irrelevant and should not be cluttering up the jury’s deliberations.&nbsp; In other situations, the inferences urged by the prosecution from post-offence conduct are impermissible for legal reasons rather than illogicality, and the evidence may be effectively withdrawn from the jury with a “no probative value” instruction.&nbsp; Whether or not a special caution is required with respect to post-offence conduct will depend not on whether that evidence alone can support an inference of guilt but on the court’s appreciation of the risk of impermissible inferences in relation to the issues on which the prosecution in its jury address places reliance. </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that post-offence conduct is a type of circumstantial evidence and that when it comes to the need for a limiting instruction, much will depend on the facts.&nbsp; However, it is not enough simply to evaluate whether evidence as to, in this case, the accused’s “no hesitation here, no shock, no uncertainty on his part” might be portrayed as relevant to the issue of murderous intent merely as a matter of logic and human experience.&nbsp; Rather, relevance depends on the evidence having probative value in relation to a live issue.&nbsp; If the post-offence evidence of demeanour is not probative it is not relevant.&nbsp; As to probity, it is necessary to evaluate demeanour evidence having regard to the practical lessons that have accumulated in the courts over many years with respect to the potentially misleading nature of certain types of post-offence demeanour.&nbsp; While the bare fact of flight from the scene may be objective the same cannot be said of what a bystander interprets as a momentary lack of hesitation or absence of a demonstration of “shock” or “uncertainty”. This type of evidence depends on the unspoken assumptions that hesitation is normal whereas an immediate reaction is abnormal, and that the conduct of the accused fell below some assumed but unarticulated standard of procrastination.&nbsp; Moreover, this assumed departure from the assumed norm is said to give rise — potentially — to further inference of murderous intent.&nbsp; The double inference is problematic and relies on the type of subjective after-the-fact evaluation which experience has shown to be unreliable.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the Crown specifically urged the jury to infer murderous intent from “no hesitation here, no shock, no uncertainty on his part, just immediate flight”.&nbsp; The Crown emphasis was not on the act of flight (which was an objective fact) but on the alleged demeanour of the accused which was a matter of interpretation and opinion by a stranger necessarily calibrated according to the stranger’s own subjective expectation and cultural frame of reference about what would be expected.&nbsp; It seems equally plausible to conclude that a person in possession of an illegal handgun that has just shot a stranger — accidentally or otherwise — would run away as fast and far as he could without any hesitation at all.&nbsp; The use of such demeanour evidence in this case ought not to have been permitted to go to the jury on the critical, and virtually the only, issue in the case — murderous intent or accident.&nbsp; A jury should not be invited to draw unequivocal inferences from equivocal conduct based on attributed motives and subjective interpretations or misinterpretations of physical reactions.&nbsp; Moreover, because the accused’s lack of hesitation and instantaneous flight are equally explainable by the consciousness of more than one offence, the conduct has no probative value in relation to intent.&nbsp; The Crown asked the jury to draw speculative and unreasonable inferences on the issue of specific intent and the jury ought to have been instructed that the evidence of flight and the pre-flight demeanour was of no probative value on the issue of murderous intent.&nbsp; In addition, failure of the accused’s trial counsel to object to this aspect of the charge should not deny him relief.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the prosecution’s case against the accused for second degree murder was not overwhelming.&nbsp; The jury had little to work with in finding a way to choose between the hand to hand combat scenario suggesting manslaughter and the downwards shooting of an individual already on the ground which might suggest second degree murder.&nbsp; In these elusive circumstances, post-offence conduct of reaction time and demeanour took on considerable importance, which is why, no doubt, the Crown laid considerable emphasis on it in its closing argument.&nbsp; The error was therefore not harmless, and the curative proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) should have no application. </span></p>

Court of Appeal, alleging that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury.&nbsp; A majority of the Court of Appeal <span style="color:black">(Finch C.J.B.C. dissenting) </span>dismissed the appeal, and Mr. White now appeals that decision before this Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

There is no hesitation here, no shock, no uncertainty on his part, just immediate flight. One would expect hesitancy if the shot was anything other than the intended action of Dennis White.

White</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72 (“<i>White (1998)</i>”), Mr. White argued on appeal that the trial judge should have specifically instructed the jury that the evidence concerning the circumstances of his flight had no probative value in relation to the question before the jury.&nbsp; In his view, the evidence relied upon by the Crown was consistent with both manslaughter and second degree murder, and was therefore irrelevant to the only live issue in the case.&nbsp; Given the prejudicial nature of such evidence, the trial judge’s failure to provide a “no probative value” instruction was an error of law that irredeemably tainted the jury’s verdict and warranted the ordering of a new trial.</span></p>

 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">At one time, it was referred to as “consciousness of guilt” evidence.&nbsp; The value of such evidence was explained by Weiler J.A. in <i>R. v. Peavoy </i>(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 620 (C.A.), at p. 629:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of after-the-fact conduct is commonly admitted to show that an accused person has acted in a manner which, based on human experience and logic, is consistent with the conduct of a guilty person and inconsistent with the conduct of an innocent person.</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueReasonsNo-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">The term “consciousness of guilt” evidence was used to describe such conduct because it was used to support an inference that the person in question believed themselves to be guilty of the crime of which they were accused.&nbsp; In some cases, certain aspects of a person’s after-the-fact conduct can best be explained by the theory that they are guilty of the crime of which they stand accused.&nbsp; For instance, if a person admits committing an act which resulted in death, evidence that the person hid the weapon or fled from the scene may (though not must) support an inference that they were guilty of culpable (as opposed to non-culpable) homicide (<i>Peavoy</i>, at p. 630).&nbsp; Such “after-the-fact” conduct is therefore admissible as circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">However, in <i>White (1998)</i>, this Court abandoned the label&nbsp; “consciousness of guilt” when describing evidence of after-the-fact conduct because such a label was thought to be unduly narrow and somewhat misleading.&nbsp; After-the-fact conduct may in fact be put to a wide variety of uses and its utility is not confined to supporting an inference that the accused had a “guilty mind”.&nbsp; As Major J. noted for the Court, at para. 20: </span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Consciousness of guilt” is simply one inference that may be drawn from the evidence of the accused’s conduct; it is not a special category of evidence in itself.&nbsp; Moreover, the words “consciousness of guilt” suggest a conclusion about the conduct in question which undermines the presumption of innocence and may prejudice the accused in the eyes of the jury.</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueReasonsNo-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">Major J. went on to suggest that this general category of evidence should be referred to by a more neutral term, such as “post-offence conduct”.&nbsp; This label would avoid the twin pitfalls of confining the relevance of such conduct to questions concerning the accused’s state of mind and of subverting the presumption of innocence.</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">As Ryan J.A. pointed out, this change in nomenclature may have created conceptual difficulties that did not exist before. The reason is that “consciousness of guilt” evidence refers to a relatively narrow category of actions, usually attempts to evade detection or prosecution, that can support an inference of guilt when taken <i>alone </i>(C.A. reasons, at paras. 128-29). That is, evidence that a person considers themselves guilty of a crime can support an inference of guilt of that crime. Jurisprudence has grown up around the sort of warnings and limiting instructions that ought to be given to juries with respect to this relatively narrow category of evidence. </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">The category of “post-offence conduct” evidence is much broader as it refers to anything done by the accused after the commission of the offence. The shift in nomenclature may therefore have led some trial judges to believe that any evidence of the accused’s actions after the offence must be subject to special warnings and limiting instructions (see C.A. reasons, at para. 129, <i>per</i> Ryan J.A.). This is not the case.</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">The principle that after-the-fact conduct may constitute circumstantial evidence of guilt remains good law.&nbsp; At its heart, the question of whether such evidence is admissible is simply a matter of relevance (<i>White (1998)</i>, at para. 23).&nbsp; As Major J. noted in <i>White (1998)</i>, “[e]vidence of post-offence conduct is not fundamentally different from other kinds of circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; In some cases it may be highly incriminating, while in others it might play only a minor corroborative role” (para. 21).&nbsp; As with all other evidence, the relevance and probative value of post-offence conduct must be assessed on a case-by-case basis (para. 26).&nbsp; <span style="color:black">Consequently, the formulation of limiting instructions with respect to the broad category of post-offence conduct is governed by the same principles as for all other circumstantial evidence. </span>Thus, while the term “consciousness of guilt” may have fallen out of use, it is still permissible for the prosecution to introduce evidence of after-the-fact conduct in support of an inference that the accused had behaved as a person who is guilty of the offence alleged — provided that, as with all circumstantial evidence, its relevance to that inference can be demonstrated.</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">That being said, though the use of such evidence has an extensive history in our criminal jurisprudence, it has also long been recognized that the introduction of post-offence conduct for the purpose of establishing the accused’s “consciousness of guilt” carries with it a substantial risk of jury error (<i>Gudmondson v. The King</i> (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332 (S.C.C.)).&nbsp; Jurors may be tempted to “jump too quickly from evidence of post-offence conduct to an inference of guilt” (<i>White (1998)</i>, at para. 57) without giving proper consideration to alternate explanations for the conduct in question. </span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best way for a trial judge to address that danger is simply to make sure that the jury are aware of any other explanations for the accused’s actions, and that they know they should reserve their final judgment about the meaning of the accused’s conduct until all the evidence has been considered in the normal course of their deliberations.&nbsp; Beyond such <u>a cautionary instruction</u>, the members of jury should be left to draw whatever inferences they choose from the evidence at the end of the day.

The purpose of a limiting instruction is to preclude the jury from considering certain evidence, either with respect to all the live issues in a case or with respect to one or more particular live issues. </span></p>

Issues of admissibility will arise over the course of the trial as evidence is tendered and evidence that is found to be inadmissible is not allowed on the record. Conversely, a limiting instruction is provided <span style="color:black">in directions to the jury</span>. For an item of evidence to be subject to a limiting instruction, it must have been admitted in the first place. Still, it may be that an item of evidence that was admissible at trial must be removed from the jury’s deliberations on some or all of the issues in the case. A limiting instruction will be necessary when, at the end of all the evidence and for the purposes of the charge to the jury, certain evidence that appeared unobjectionable when it was admitted should in fact be removed from the jury with respect to one or more of the issues in the case.</span></p>

Moreover, the same rules of evidence govern admissibility and the need for limiting instructions. </span></p>

In particular, to be admissible, such evidence must be relevant to a live issue and it must not be subject to a specific exclusionary rule (e.g. the hearsay rule); it may also be excluded pursuant to the exercise of a recognized judicial discretion (D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser,<i> The Law of Evidence</i> (5th ed. 2008), at p. 26), such as the discretion to exclude evidence whose prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. These same principles also determine the need for and scope of a limiting instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

For clarity, I will discuss them under the following four headings: (a) relevance, (b) narrative (which is best understood as an attenuation of the rule of relevance), (c) specific exclusionary rules and (d) discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

It is also possible, and often appropriate, for the trial judge to warn the jury of the risks associated with certain types of evidence. The purpose of such a caution is to alert the jury to the danger, which has been recognized through judicial experience, but then to allow the properly informed jurors to evaluate the evidence with care. </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The terms “limiting instruction” and “caution” (or “warning”) are not narrowly defined terms of art which courts have consistently treated as distinct.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is a distinction between the following two types of jury instruction: one that tells the jury they must not consider the evidence for one or several purposes, and the other that leaves evidence for the jury to consider, but warns them to be careful with it.&nbsp; For ease of reference, I will refer to the first type of instruction as a limiting instruction and to the second type as a warning or caution.</span></p>

What Mr. White argued here is that, beyond providing a warning, the judge ought to have told the jury that it was not allowed to consider evidence of his immediate flight in deciding as between a finding of second degree murder or manslaughter. Accordingly, after discussing the principles governing limiting instructions, I will address (e) how a caution can alleviate the risks associated with certain evidence that ought to be left with the jury.</span></p>

At its heart, the requirement for a “no probative value” instruction is a question of relevance: if an item of evidence is not relevant to a live issue, then that item of evidence should be removed from consideration by the jury (<i>White (1998)</i>,<i> </i>at para. 26, explaining <i>Arcangioli</i>).&nbsp; I agree with Binnie J. that irrelevant evidence should be excluded or, if it is already on record, subject to a “no probative value” instruction (para. 169). In order for evidence to satisfy the standard of relevance, it must have “some tendency as a matter of logic and human experience to make the proposition for which it is advanced more likely than that proposition would be in the absence of that evidence” (Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 31, approved in <i>R. v.

In such a case, the rules of evidence remain unchanged: the evidence is left with the jury, for it to weigh with respect to the issue of identity; the jury <span style="color:black">is precluded from considering the same evidence </span>with respect to determining the <i>mens rea</i> for murder as opposed to manslaughter, by way of a limiting instruction to the effect that this evidence is not probative of this particular live issue.

However, this was not meant to be a free-standing principle <span style="color:black">governing admissibility or limiting instructions</span>. <i>Arcangioli </i>and <i>White (1998) </i>make it clear that the basic test is always relevance in the ordinary sense:</span></p>

Binnie J. invokes the importance of “having regard to the practical lessons that have accumulated in the courts over many years with respect to the potentially misleading nature of certain types of post-offence conduct” (<i>ibid.</i>). He identifies the category of “post-offence demeanour” (<i>ibid.</i>) evidence as one type of evidence that should be treated with particular care.</span></p>

First, when the question is “should the evidence be removed from the jury because it is <i>irrelevant</i>?”, it <i>is </i>enough to evaluate whether the item of evidence is relevant to the material fact at issue<span style="color:black"> as a matter of logic and human experience. Of course, judges should avail themselves of </span>the accumulated knowledge from courts and studies to the effect that certain types of evidence can appear probative when they are not. This knowledge can inform a determination that a particular item of evidence is too equivocal to meet the test of relevance. This is still the same test of whether a particular item of evidence tends to make a material fact in issue more or less likely, just with more information based upon judicial experience. </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">However, in his discussion of relevance, Binnie J. refers to these practical lessons of the courts with respect to the “potentially <u>misleading</u> nature of certain types of post-offence conduct” (para. 180 (emphasis added)). He also refers to the Kaufman Report, which says that “evidence of the accused’s ‘demeanour’ . . . can be <u>overused</u> and <u>misused</u>” (para. 182 (emphasis added)). I do not agree that<i> </i>the risk that a jury <i>will misuse or be misled</i> by an item of evidence, should inform the relevance determination. Instead, <span style="color:black">this risk is</span> appropriately addressed through the trial judge’s discretion to exclude evidence whose prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value or through a caution in the jury charge to be careful with the evidence. I discuss both below.</span></p>

The Crown did not invite the jury to rely on Mr. White’s appearance in relation to shock or surprise, but on the fact that he did not hesitate before fleeing. As I elaborate below, the objective physical evidence that Mr. White failed to hesitate immediately after shooting Mr. Matasi has nothing to do with the serious problems identified by the Kaufman Inquiry into the Morin conviction or the <i>Nelles</i> case (<i>R. v. Nelles</i> (1982), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. Prov. Ct. (Crim. Div.))).</span></span></p>

This may be achieved by refusing to admit the evidence at trial. It can also happen that the disproportionately prejudicial nature of a certain item of evidence only becomes apparent in light of the evidence as a whole. The trial judge may then instruct the jury in his charge that they may not consider a certain item of evidence in their deliberations. </span></p>

As noted in <i>White (1998)</i>, the decision in <i>Arcangioli </i>did not rest on the exercise of this discretion:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It bears emphasizing that in these sorts of cases, while the evidence cannot be said to be irrelevant to the issue in dispute, it might still be withdrawn from the jury by the trial judge on the basis that it is more prejudicial than probative.&nbsp; The same would be true in cases where two separate offences have been committed and the evidence of post-offence conduct provides scant basis for distinguishing between them.&nbsp; Such a decision would fall within the ordinary discretion of the trial judge, however, and would not be mandated by the result in <i>Arcangioli</i>. [para. 33]</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueReasonsNo-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">Although the issue was not raised in the present appeal, there is a distinction to be made between removing post-offence conduct from consideration by the jury because it is not probative of a live issue and excluding it because its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; Some of the concerns about juries misusing evidence of post-offence conduct and “demeanour evidence” may be better addressed by the application of this discretion. </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">As I explained above, these concerns, do not justify applying a different test of relevance to post-offence conduct or “demeanour evidence” than that applied to any other circumstantial evidence. The trial judge’s discretion to exclude evidence that is more prejudicial than probative recognizes that jurors will sometimes misuse relevant evidence. However, since this discretion calls into question the jury’s competence in performing its fact-finding function, the excessive prejudicial effect should be invoked explicitly. It should not be disguised within a finding that the evidence is not probative at all.&nbsp; Where this discretion is not invoked, the jury should be trusted, often with a warning, to weigh the relevant evidence.</span></p>

I do not agree. I would observe that <span style="color:black">the trial judge was not asked to exercise this discretion at any point in the proceedings in this case, nor was it ever suggested to the Court of Appeal or to this Court that he ought to have. </span>In any event, as I discuss below, the evidence was probative and, based upon the record, I see no basis for determining it would have had a disproportionately prejudicial effect. </span></p>

Similarly, once evidence is determined to be relevant with respect to a particular live issue, the jury should normally be free to weigh the evidence in drawing conclusions about that live issue. This is subject to specific exclusionary rules and the judge’s discretion to exclude evidence that is more prejudicial than probative. </span></p>

Certain types of evidence may appear more probative than they really are, may be systematically less reliable than they seem, or may be consistent with other less obvious explanations than the one advanced by a party (though not equally so). These potential dangers may not be immediately apparent to lay juries (see <i>R. v. Khela</i>, 2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104, at para. 4). Accordingly, courts have recognized that when leaving certain types of evidence with the jury, the trial judge should provide a caution that alerts the jury to the risks involved.&nbsp; The content and nature of the warning should address the risk and depend upon the severity of the danger.</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">A warning or caution does not serve to remove the evidence from the jury’s consideration. Instead, providing a caution allows for juries to benefit from judicial experience concerning the risks associated with certain types of evidence, while respecting the jury’s competence in fulfilling its fact-finding role. The point is that once jurors are alerted to the risks that are not necessarily apparent to the average citizen, they can be trusted to properly weigh the evidence. Our jury system is predicated on the conviction that jurors are intelligent and reasonable fact-finders.&nbsp; It is contrary to this fundamental premise to assume that properly instructed jurors will weigh the evidence unreasonably or draw irrational and speculative conclusions from relevant evidence.&nbsp; I agree with the view expressed by Dickson C.J., in <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, that “it would be quite wrong to make too much of the risk that the jury <u>might</u> use the evidence for an improper purpose.&nbsp; This line of thinking could seriously undermine the entire jury system.&nbsp; The very strength of the jury is that the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence is determined by a group of ordinary citizens who are not legal specialists and who bring to the legal process a healthy measure of common sense” (p. 692 (emphasis in original)). </span></p>

Indeed, in discussing “the need for a limiting instruction” (para. 178), he invokes judges’ instructions about evidence of jailhouse informants and eyewitness identification (para. 185). Yet, these two types of evidence are not systematically removed from the jury’s consideration by way of a limiting instruction, but are generally left with the jury along with a warning in the jury charge. </span></p>

The instruction “must take into account the dual purpose of the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning: first, to alert the jury to the danger of relying on the unsupported evidence of unsavoury witnesses and to explain the reasons for special scrutiny of their testimony; and second, in appropriate cases, to give the jury the tools necessary to identify evidence capable of enhancing the trustworthiness of those witnesses” (<i>Khela</i>, at para. 47, <i>per</i> Fish J., cited in <i>R. v.

In the vast majority of cases, eyewitness identification will be relevant to the issue of identity, i.e. whether the accused is the person who committed the offence. However, eyewitness identification can be “deceptively credible” because an honest and sincere witness may be mistaken (</span><i><span style="line-height:200%">R. v. Hibbert</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, 2002 SCC 39, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at paras. 50-51, specifically referring to “eyewitness in-court identification”, but also discussing eyewitness identification generally; see also <i>R. v. Curran </i>(2004), 188 O.A.C. 1, at para. 29)</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">. The appropriate response is not to instruct the jury that they cannot consider eyewitness testimony in determining the issue of identity. Rather, it is to warn the jury that the evidence may not be as reliable as it seems. Indeed, this is what judges generally do.</span></p>

It is also possible for the judge to warn the jury of the risks and thereby assist them in performing their fact-finding function. In my view, a limiting instruction is only appropriate when the evidence is not relevant to one or more live issues, is subject to a specific exclusionary rule or is explicitly found by the trial judge to be more prejudicial than probative. Otherwise, judicial experience about the risks associated with certain types of evidence should be communicated to the jury by way of a caution. </span></p>

At the outset, I should state that this issue was of little significance at trial. As Charron J.’s detailed review of the record shows (paras. 111-21), this issue was not<span style="color:black"> </span>a significant element in the Crown’s case. </span></p>

First, throughout the Crown’s case, the identity of the shooter was a very live issue. Evidence of flight was of central importance to the Crown’s case on the issue of identity. Second, in making its case on intent, the Crown emphasized forensic evidence and eyewitness testimony. Mr. White’s lack of hesitation prior to flight was a very minor part of the Crown’s case on intent.&nbsp; Third, defence counsel did not respond to the Crown’s submissions about the evidence of lack of hesitation prior to flight in his closing argument nor did he raise any concerns about the use of this evidence with the trial judge. </span></p>

In Mr. White’s view, this submission “breached the well-established rule that post-offence conduct, such as flight, is not admissible to determine an accused’s level of culpability” (A.F., at para. 58).&nbsp; Relying on <i>Arcangioli</i>, and its successor cases, he argues that the Crown invited the jury to draw an impermissible inference of “consciousness of guilt” of second degree murder from his “immediate flight”.</span></p>

It is less consistent with accident. Thus, the evidence that Mr. White <span style="color:black">did not hesitate</span> when the gun was fired <span style="color:black">in response to</span> this unexpected and calamitous turn of events supports an inference that he deliberately pulled the trigger.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">Would the accused have been <i>equally </i>likely to flee the scene whether he was guilty of murder or of manslaughter? (in <i>Arcangioli</i>)</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">Would the accused have been <i>equally </i>likely to <span style="color:black">hesitate before fleeing</span> had he shot the victim intentionally or accidentally? (in this case)</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">The two questions raise distinct sets of considerations. On the one hand, logic and human experience suggest that there is no reason to think that a person who has committed manslaughter would be more likely to stay at the scene of the crime than one who has committed murder. In both cases the person has committed a very serious offence by unlawfully killing someone and will be just as likely to flee.&nbsp; In both cases, the person may flee for a host of reasons, such as to avoid arrest, to minimize evidence of that person’s connection with the crime, or to buy additional time.&nbsp; Indeed, flight is a response equally consistent with a wide range of much less serious offences, such as theft, vandalism, or common assault (as discussed in <i>Arcangioli</i>).</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">On the other hand, logic and human experience suggest that people are more likely to show some outward sign<span style="color:black">, such as hesitation, before continuing on with their actions,</span> when they do something accidentally than when they do it on purpose.&nbsp; This is all the more so when the accident involves a sharp physical effect on the person (the discharge of a gun in one’s hand) and results in a terrible consequence, such as having killed another person. As I have discussed, lack of hesitation prior to flight, is less consistent with shooting and killing someone accidentally than it is with doing so intentionally.&nbsp; Thus, in the context of determining relevance, evidence of flight <i>per se</i> is different from evidence of lack of hesitation prior to flight.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

The accused’s mental or emotional state is then submitted as suspect and probative of guilt (see <i>Nelles</i>; <i>R. v. Levert</i> (2001), 150 O.A.C. 208, at paras. </span><span style="line-height:

The witness’s assessment depends on a subjective impression and interpretation of the accused’s behaviour (<i>Levert</i>,<i> </i>at para. 27). Moreover, it appears to involve an element of mind reading (<i>R. v. Anderson</i>, 2009 ABCA 67, 3 Alta. L.R. (5th) 29, at para. 51). Additionally, insofar as the witness is inferring the accused’s state of mind from the accused’s outward appearance, there may be a legitimate concern that this is inadmissible lay opinion evidence. This is to be contrasted with evidence of objective conduct that allows the jury to draw its own inferences about the accused’s state of mind.</span></p>

This was not a case where the accused’s outward behaviour was adduced to prove that an awareness of guilt was boiling under the surface.&nbsp; The evidence here is not analogous to a doctor’s testimony that a nurse had “a very strange expression” and displayed no signs of grief when she was “writing up the final death note as part of her other difficult duties on the occasion of the death of a baby in her care” (<i>Nelles</i>, at p. 125, cited in Binnie J.’s reasons, at para. 142); nor is it analogous to testimony that the accused seemed “unusually quiet” in the area of a crime scene and turned his head away (<i>Anderson</i>, at para. 50, cited in Binnie J.’s reasons, at para. 143). Instead, the evidence was in the nature of the absence of an immediate reflex. </span></p>

As her discussion of the record shows, “while every witness to the event testified that the shooter immediately fled, <i>no witness</i> was asked by the Crown how the shooter ‘looked’ at the time he fled” (para. 122 (emphasis in original)). Rather, if any examples of “demeanour evidence” were at issue in this case, it was counsel for the defence who attempted to introduce them. I further agree that, had defence counsel successfully shown that there was evidence that Mr. White did look surprised or shocked after the shooting, the jury would have been entitled to the benefit of this evidence (Charron J.’s reasons, at para. 126). </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">It is true that the Crown’s use of evidence of lack of hesitation prior to flight presupposes a normal range of reactions: it assumes that most people will hesitate or show some other outward sign of surprise when something dramatic and horrible accidentally happens. Of course, it may be that not everyone will respond in this way. However, I consider this view of a normal almost reflexive or involuntary response to be well founded. I have no doubt that had there been evidence of hesitation, defence counsel would have submitted it as probative of an accident. Divergence from this norm, though not determinative, is more consistent with an intentional shooting than with an accident. It would therefore have been wrong for the trial judge to instruct the jury that this evidence had no probative value in determining intent, as Mr. White suggests he should have. It was not irrelevant.</span></p>

Paré</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 618;<i> R. v. Chartrand</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, at pp. 881-82; <i>R. v. Mac</i>, 2002 SCC 24, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 856, at para. 4; R.

For the purpose of proving identity and as part of the narrative, flight <i>per se </i>was clearly admissible. Indeed, it would have been impossible for the Crown to provide a full account of what transpired at the scene and of the events leading up to Mr. White’s arrest without mentioning that he had fled the scene. However, by the time the trial judge was instructing the jury, flight <i>per se</i> was not important; it was merely collateral to other evidence upon which the Crown relied.&nbsp; T</span>he Crown itself had never suggested that Mr. White’s decision to flee the scene was indicative of his level of culpability.&nbsp; Furthermore, not much later in the charge, the trial judge correctly summarized the use to which the Crown had put the evidence of Mr. White’s post-event conduct.&nbsp; </span></p>

There could have been explanations for Mr. White’s failure to hesitate or evince any physical signs of surprise other than that he intentionally pulled the trigger. The notion that a person who accidentally shoots someone to death will normally have the immediate reaction of hesitating or showing some other sign of surprise is well founded. Still, there may be exceptional individuals who do not respond in the normal way. While the existence of other, less likely explanations does not render this evidence irrelevant, the possibility of other explanations might not have been immediately apparent to the jury. Thus, it was appropriate for the trial judge to warn the jury to be careful with this evidence and that it might not be of much assistance to them. So he did. This caution was adequate to alert the jury to the risk associated with this evidence and to allow them to properly weigh the evidence.</span></p>

The Queen</i> (1956), 24 C.R. 354 (S.C.C.), at p. 359). . . . Errors might also be characterized as having a minor effect if they relate to an issue that was not central to the overall determination of guilt or innocence, or if they benefit the defence, such as by imposing a more onerous burden on the Crown (<i>Khan</i>, at para. 30).&nbsp; The question of whether an error or its effect is minor should be answered without reference to the strength of the other evidence presented at trial.&nbsp; The overriding question is whether the error on its face or in its effect was so minor, so irrelevant to the ultimate issue in the trial, or so clearly non-prejudicial, that any reasonable judge or jury could not possibly have rendered a different verdict if the error had not been made.

If a properly instructed jury would inevitably have convicted, upholding the conviction produces no significant injustice to the accused (<i>Van</i>, at para. 36). It is also in the public interest to avoid the cost and delay of a new trial that could not realistically produce a different result (<i>Van</i>, at para. 36, citing <i>R. v. Jolivet</i>, 2000 SCC 29, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, at para. 46, <i>per</i> Binnie J.). Still, “given the difficult task for an appellate court of evaluating the strength of the Crown’s case retroactively, without the benefit of hearing the witnesses’ testimony and experiencing the trial as it unfolded”, the high standard of invariable or inevitable conviction must be met to cure serious errors (<i>Van</i>, at para. 36, citing <i>R. v.</i> <i>Trochym</i>, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, at para. 82).</span></span></p>

There was no serious possibility that the jury would be induced to consider the flight <i>per se </i>as a relevant circumstance in determining whether Mr. White had the requisite intent for second degree murder.</span></p>

There is, however, no requirement for <u>perfectly</u> instructed juries” (para. 2 (emphasis in original)).&nbsp; If the instructions in the present case were not perfect, they were certainly adequate to the task at hand.&nbsp; Given the nature of the purported error, it was unlikely to have any effect on the jury’s deliberations.&nbsp; Thus, even assuming that the trial judge erred, that error was, in the words of Le<span style="color:black">B</span>el J., “clearly non-prejudicial” (<i>Van</i>, at para. 35).</span></p>

There is no hesitation here, no shock, no uncertainty on his part, just immediate flight. One would expect hesitancy if the shot was anything other than the intended action of Dennis White.

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Crown submits that what is most compelling is the forensic evidence.</u>&nbsp; It submits that the location of the bullet fragments is significant and suggests that Mr. Matasi could not have been standing up because with the elevation drop, a bullet shot north, when passing through Mr. Matasi’s body would have ended up not on the ground but in a building somewhere on Water Street. <u>The Crown lastly noted that the accused ran away with no apparent hesitation or confusion, which suggests that what happened is what he intended to happen.</u>&nbsp; This, the Crown suggested, indicates intention by one of the two ways possible for murder.

 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">I agree with Binnie J. that evidence of post-offence conduct is not subject to any special rule.&nbsp; As Binnie J. stresses, it is definitely wrong to suggest that evidence of anything said or done by an accused after the commission of an offence gives rise to special rules of admissibility, or that it is subject to special warnings as to what use may be made of it by the trier of fact.&nbsp; As he aptly puts it:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation" style="text-indent:-58.3pt;line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general rule is now, as in the past, that it is for the jury to decide, on the basis of the evidence as a whole, whether the post-offence conduct put in evidence against the accused is related to the commission of the crime before them rather than to something else, and if so, how much weight, if any, such evidence should be accorded in the final determination of guilt or innocence.&nbsp; For the trial judge to interfere<span style="color:black"> in </span>that process will in most cases constitute a usurpation of the jury’s exclusive fact-finding role.&nbsp; [para. 137] </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">I also agree with Binnie J. that judicial experience has taught us that in some cases jurors have found certain types of evidence more persuasive than warranted, thus making it necessary in appropriate cases to caution the jury accordingly.&nbsp; As he notes, eyewitness identification and jailhouse confessions to police informants are examples that readily come to mind.&nbsp; Likewise, some evidence of post-offence conduct may seem quite suggestive of guilt though, in reality, the conduct is essentially equivocal in nature.&nbsp; For example, evidence that an accused lied to the police about the offence in question may lead jurors to leap too quickly to infer guilt without considering other reasons why he or she may have lied.&nbsp; A special caution may therefore be required.&nbsp; In some situations, the probative value of the evidence may be slight and far outweighed by its prejudicial effect, in which case it may be best to remove it from the jury’s consideration altogether.&nbsp; My colleague Rothstein J. explains how these general principles call for a case-by-case assessment. </span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;Further, I agree with Binnie J. that inferences drawn by a witness, based on his or her observation of the accused’s demeanour, may well call for a special caution or be subject to an exclusion order in accordance with these principles.&nbsp; By way of example, Binnie J. recalls the infamous prosecutions of Susan Nelles and Guy Paul Morin for crimes they did not commit.&nbsp; He rightly notes that the case against each was built in part on inferences of guilt drawn from equivocal post-offence conduct. For example, one witness testified that Ms. Nelles had a “very strange expression on her face and no sign at all of grief” following the death of the fourth baby (<i>R. v. Nelles </i>(1982), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. Prov. Ct. (Crim. Div.)), at p. 124).&nbsp; In the case of Guy Paul Morin, police witnesses drew a negative inference of guilt, for example, from the fact that Mr. Morin came out to greet them rather than wait for them to reach his door.&nbsp; In his report on the wrongful conviction of Mr. Morin, Commissioner Kaufman found that this was an innocuous event which only became “coloured” by the officers’ own perceptions of Mr. Morin (the Honourable Fred Kaufman, <i>The Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin: Report</i> (1998), at p. 786).</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">However, I disagree with Binnie J. that Crown counsel’s reference in his closing address to the fact that Mr. White immediately fled the scene with “no hesitation here, no shock, no uncertainty” falls in this category of cases.&nbsp; In my view, the Crown did not invite the jury to draw an impermissible inference of guilt, as contended by Mr. White.&nbsp; As I will explain, when read in the context of the evidence and issues at trial, Crown counsel’s comment could only have been understood by the jury as a rhetorical argument that no evidence supported the defence theory of accidental discharge of the firearm.&nbsp; The failure of defence counsel to raise any issue at trial regarding Crown counsel’s closing address or the trial judge’s instructions on the evidence of flight further supports this interpretation.</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">With respect, I also find no support in the record for the contention, accepted by Binnie J., that this case is essentially a rerun of <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i>,<i> </i>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 129.&nbsp; In <i>Arcangioli</i>, the accused admitted to participating in the culpable event and the only issue at trial was his level of culpability.&nbsp; Conversely, as I will explain, the identity of the shooter was a very live issue in Mr. White’s trial and the evidence of flight was highly relevant to the issue of identification.&nbsp; Further, it formed an inextricable part of the narrative as every witness to the event described the shooter, gun in hand, fleeing the scene.&nbsp; Therefore the evidence was admissible at trial and properly left for the jury’s assessment.&nbsp; It is not open to Mr. White on appeal to rewrite the script of his trial.&nbsp; In addition, on the question of intention, the trial judge took care to instruct the jury that they should “be careful with” this evidence, as it may not tell them “much more than that for any number of reasons he would be in some kind of trouble if he stayed at the scene and it may not be of much assistance in assessing his precise state of mind at the time the gun was fired” (A.R., at p. 606).&nbsp; In the context of this trial, no more was required.</span></p>

 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[114]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">I stress the fact that identification was a live issue throughout the presentation of the evidence as it is clear on reviewing the record that the evidence of flight was properly introduced for the purpose of establishing the identity of the shooter.&nbsp; The evidence of flight also formed an inextricable part of the narrative: every witness to the event testified that the killer, gun in hand, immediately ran away after the fatal shot was fired.&nbsp; Further, to the extent that the evidence of flight established that <i>Mr. White</i> was the person who fled the scene, the evidence was highly probative of the issue of identification.&nbsp; Indeed, the record reveals that it was the evidence of flight that ultimately sealed Mr. White’s fate on the issue of identity. Crown counsel (who addressed the jury first before there was any suggestion from the defence that Mr. White’s involvement in the altercation may be conceded) effectively marshalled this evidence in his closing address, suggesting to the jury that they would “have little difficulty in coming to the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Dennis White is the person who fired the shot that killed Lee Matasi” (A.R., at p.&nbsp;555).&nbsp; After referring to the direct eyewitness identification evidence, Crown counsel summarized the flight evidence as follows:</span></p>

Mr.&nbsp;McRitchie then heard the word “bitch”, immediately followed by another gunshot (A.R., at p. 487).&nbsp; </span></p>

If the post-offence evidence of demeanour is not probative, it is not relevant.&nbsp; As to probity, it is necessary to evaluate demeanour evidence having regard<i> </i>to<i> </i>the practical lessons that have accumulated in the courts over many years with respect to the potentially misleading nature of certain types of post-offence conduct.&nbsp; As a subset of post-offence conduct, use of evidence of post-offence demeanour (“outward behaviour or bearing”, <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary </i>(2nd ed. 2004), at p. 400 “demeanour”) has led to serious practical difficulties in cases such as the wrongful conviction of Guy Paul Morin and the Crown’s ultimately unsuccessful prosecution of the nurse Susan Nelles.</span></p>

The most that can be said is that the accused’s emotional responses to the event appeared to be unusual.&nbsp; Guilt would, of course, be one explanation for the apparently unusual nature of the accused’s responses; but another equally plausible one would be that the accused’s <i>general</i> emotional responses or levels of expressiveness differed from the norm.&nbsp; Without recourse to a battery of psychological testing, or the admission of a host of evidence about how the accused had responded in other, comparable, situations (if indeed any could be found), it is difficult to see how the jury could ever eliminate this possible explanation.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation" style="text-indent:-58.3pt;line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . the trial judge should not have left three of these items of evidence with the jury as evidence from which they could infer consciousness of guilt:&nbsp; the appellant’s anger at being described as someone </span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">capable<span style="color:black"> of killing the victim, his failure to make certain phone calls and his failure to ask police if Jennifer was the<i> </i>victim.<i> </i>&nbsp;These forms of conduct are <u>examples of demeanour evidence</u> that is highly suspect and easily misinterpreted.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 118.]</span></span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%;color:black">While this decision treats the idea of demeanour evidence rather broadly, it usefully reinforces the underlying principle that is of concern here, namely that the jury should not be </span><span lang="EN-CA">invited</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%;color:black"> to draw unequivocal inferences from equivocal conduct based on attributed motives and subjective interpretations (or misinterpretations) of (in this case) physical reactions.&nbsp; Such evidence does not provide a safe hook on which to hang a conviction for second degree murder.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 336, Dickson J. (as he then was) expressed the view at pp. 343-44 that “[a]lthough by no means determinative, it is not irrelevant that counsel for the accused did not comment, at the conclusion of the charge, upon the failure of the trial judge to direct the attention of the jury to the evidence”.</span></p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[193]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">There are certainly cases in which the impact of events unfolding at trial is not clear from a transcript, and the failure of experienced defence counsel to object may suggest that the errors now alleged were seen, in context, as harmless.&nbsp; <span style="color:black">In other situations the failure to object may of course be tactical, as where in the defence counsel’s view a correction may be more damaging than letting the error pass in silence.&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, “the jury charge is the responsibility of the trial judge and not defence counsel” (<i>Jacquard</i>, at para. 37).&nbsp; The gravity of the error is a valid consideration for appellate interference.</span></p>

 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">[196]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">The case law under the curative proviso was recently reviewed by the Court in <i>R. v.

Illes</i>, 2008 SCC 57, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 134.&nbsp; The general rule is that the proviso can only be invoked with respect to “errors of a minor nature having no impact on the verdict” or “serious errors which would justify a new trial, but for the fact that the evidence adduced was seen as so overwhelming that the reviewing court concludes that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice”.&nbsp; By “overwhelming” it is meant that “a trier of fact would inevitably convict” (<i>Illes</i>, at para. 21): see <i>R. v. Charlebois</i>, 2000 SCC 53, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 674, at para. 11; <i>R. v. Khan</i>, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 26; and <i>R. v.

 <p class="Citation" style="text-indent:-58.3pt;line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unable to say that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had the jury been told that the evidence of the appellant’s post-offence conduct could not be used to resolve the issue of intent.&nbsp; That issue was, I repeat, in effect, the only live issue the jury had to consider.&nbsp; It cannot safely be concluded that the uncorrected invitation by the Crown to infer intent on the basis of the appellant’s immediate flight, combined with the judge’s review of the Crown’s position, his failure to give a “no probative value” instruction, and his instruction linking the evidence of post-offence conduct to the mental element, could not have affected the outcome of the appellant’s trial.&nbsp; [para. 100]</span></p>
