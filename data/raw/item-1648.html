 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Lamer C.J. and Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci, Major and Binnie JJ.:&nbsp; A statement made by an accused to a person in authority must be made voluntarily and must be the product of an operating mind.&nbsp; This rule is based upon two fundamentally important concepts:&nbsp; the need to ensure the reliability of the statement and the need to ensure fairness by guarding against improper coercion by the state.&nbsp; This results in the requirement that the admission must not be obtained by either threats or inducements.&nbsp; The person in authority requirement is grounded in the underlying rationales for the confessions rule and should remain part of the rule.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The definition of ‚Äúperson in authority‚Äù typically refers to those formally engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused and so applies to police officers and prison officials or guards.&nbsp; When an accused makes a statement to a police officer or prison guard a <i>voir dire</i> should be held to determine its admissibility as a voluntary statement, unless the <i>voir dire</i> is waived by the defence.&nbsp; In addition, those persons whom the accused reasonably believes are acting on behalf of the state and could therefore influence or control the proceedings against him or her may also be persons in authority.&nbsp; That issue must be resolved by considering it from the viewpoint of the accused.&nbsp; The receiver‚Äôs status as a person in authority arises only if the accused has knowledge of that status.&nbsp; In addition, there must be a reasonable basis for the accused‚Äôs belief that the person hearing the statement was a person in authority.&nbsp; This issue will not normally arise in relation to undercover police officers because, from the accused‚Äôs viewpoint, they will not usually be viewed as persons in authority.</span></p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The defence must raise the ‚Äúperson in authority‚Äù issue with the trial judge.&nbsp; This is appropriate for it is only the accused who can know that the statement was made to someone regarded by the accused as a person in authority.&nbsp; On the ensuing <i>voir dire</i>, the accused will have the evidential burden of demonstrating that there is a valid issue for consideration.&nbsp; If the accused meets the burden, the Crown will then have the persuasive burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the receiver of the statement was not a person in authority, or if it is found that he or she was a person in authority, that the statement was made voluntarily.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In extremely rare cases, the evidence adduced during a trial, viewed objectively, may indicate that the issue as to whether the receiver of a statement of the accused was a person in authority should be explored by way of <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; In those cases, the trial judge must of his or her own motion direct a <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; Evidence which clearly demonstrates that the receiver of the statement was closely connected to the authorities should alert the trial judge to the need for a <i>voir dire</i> on the issue.&nbsp; This evidence progresses along a spectrum.&nbsp; Where the receiver of the statement is a ‚Äúconventional‚Äù person in authority, such as a police officer or prison guard, the trial judge must clearly proceed to a <i>voir dire</i> to test the voluntariness of the statement.&nbsp; Similarly, where the evidence discloses a close connection between the receiver and the authorities such that, if known to the accused, he or she could reasonably have believed that the receiver was acting as an agent of the prosecuting authorities, the trial judge should inquire whether the defence is prepared to discharge its evidential burden on the person in authority issue or whether it waives a <i>voir dire</i> on this issue.&nbsp; However, the further away the receiver of the statement is from the conventional person in authority, the less likely it will be that the evidence will alert the trial judge to the need to hold a <i>voir dire</i> and the greater the obligation of the accused to raise the issue.</span></p>

<div class="Section5">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">If the trial judge is satisfied that the receiver of the statement was not a person in authority but that the statement of the accused was obtained by reprehensible coercive tactics such as violence or credible threats of violence, then a direction should be given to the jury.&nbsp; The jury should be instructed that if they conclude that the statement was obtained by coercion, they should be cautious about accepting it, and that little if any weight should be attached to it.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The evidence at trial did not disclose any evidence that was sufficient to trigger the trial judge‚Äôs obligation to hold a <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; When the statements were admitted into evidence, there was nothing to suggest that the complainant or her family members had spoken to the police or anyone else in authority or were even considering making a complaint.&nbsp; Similarly, there was nothing to suggest that the accused subjectively believed the complainant‚Äôs family to have control over criminal proceedings. The trial judge properly used the evidence of the confession to confirm the complainant‚Äôs testimony.</span></p>

Shruti"> must be bound by applicable policy rationales which justify the confessions rule</span>‚Äô<span style="font-family:Shruti">s exclusion of relevant evidence</span><span lang="EN-GB">. </span>&nbsp;Essentially where policy concerns&nbsp; historically related to the confession‚Äôs reliability, modern rationales of the confessions rule now focus on state conduct and individual fairness.&nbsp; Basic fairness in the criminal process unifies the two rationales of reliability and state deterrence, and questions of truth have given way to a focus on voluntariness.&nbsp; <span style="font-family:Shruti">The confessions rule is only concerned with voluntariness, however, where statements are made to persons in authority.</span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp; Indeed, the general unfairness of utilizing involuntary statements resulting from private coercion has never been the focus of the confessions rule, even when the rule was justified by policy concerns for reliability.&nbsp; Its modern rationales explicitly affirm that the rule is concerned only with voluntariness within the relationship between the state and the individual.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">As such, legislative change to the confessions rule altering the requirement of a person in authority is neither appropriate nor desirable.&nbsp; The best rule is still that,</span> once it is accepted that the confession of the accused was not made to a person in authority, it is properly admissible without any requirement for the Crown to establish that it was voluntary. Strict retention of this rule promotes clarity, is <span style="font-family:Shruti">consistent with modern rationales justifying the exclusion of relevant evidence and serves the general public interest by facilitating the pursuit of truth. The </span>‚Äú<span style="font-family:Shruti">person in authority</span>‚Äù<span style="font-family:

The King</i>, [1949] S.C.R. 262, at p.&nbsp;269, Rand J. explained that ‚Äúthe rule is directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions‚Äù.&nbsp; Voluntariness also requires that the statement must be the product of an operating mind:&nbsp; see<i> Ward</i> <i>v.

The Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 376, at p.&nbsp;425, <i>per</i> Beetz J.&nbsp; Voluntariness is determined by a careful investigation of the circumstances surrounding the statement of the accused, and involves a consideration of both objective and subjective factors.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">See Lawrence Herman, ‚ÄúThe Unexplored Relationship Between the Privilege Against Compulsory Self‚ÄëIncrimination and the Involuntary Confession Rule (Part I)‚Äù (1992), 53 <i>Ohio St. L.J</i>. 101, at p.&nbsp;153, citing Sir Geoffrey Gilbert, <i>The Law of Evidence</i> (1769).&nbsp; Thus, it is apparent that from its very inception, the confessions rule was designed not only to ensure the reliability of the confession, but also to guarantee fundamental fairness in the criminal process.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is inescapable that the decision to reject all involuntary confessions incorporates policies that find fault with the use of coercive tactics to extract statements, independent of their impact on reliability.&nbsp; In short, the exclusion of involuntary confessions, at least as practised in the United States and formerly in England, is designed as a response to improper police interrogation tactics as much as, if not more than, it is aimed at ensuring evidence reliability.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">This aspect of the confessions rule ‚Äë‚Äë which focuses on voluntariness over truth ‚Äë‚Äë indicates that the rule is not concerned solely with accuracy or reliability.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one of the themes running through the jurisprudence on confessions is the idea that a person in the power of the state‚Äôs criminal process has the right to freely choose whether or not to make a statement to the police.&nbsp; This idea is accompanied by a correlative concern with the repute and integrity of the judicial process.&nbsp; This theme has not always been ascendant.&nbsp; Yet, its importance cannot be denied.&nbsp; It persists, both in Canadian jurisprudence and in the rules governing the rights of suspects in other countries.</p>

(R.J.)</i>, at p.&nbsp;500).&nbsp; Nevertheless, I must recognize, as did my colleagues, that in a modern sense, the confessions rule has clearly been associated with these ideas.&nbsp; Indeed, in the <i>Report of the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence</i> (1982), the Task Force concluded at p.&nbsp;175 that ‚Äúthe clear common law principle that the Crown must establish its case without the assistance of the accused .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the primary rationale of the Confessions Rule today‚Äù.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">The fact that an inducement is made by a person in authority may make it more likely to operate on the accused‚Äôs mind and lead him to confess.&nbsp; If the ground on which confessions induced by promises held out by persons in authority are held to be inadmissible is that they may not be true, then it may be that there is a similar risk that in some circumstances the confession may not be true if induced by a promise held out by a person not in authority, for instance if such a person offers a bribe in return for a confession.&nbsp; There is, however, in their lordships‚Äô opinion, no doubt that the law as it is at present only excludes confessions induced by promises when those promises are made by persons in authority.</p>

Todd</i> (1901), 4 C.C.C. 514 (Man. K.B.).&nbsp; In that case, the accused made a statement to two men he believed to be fellow prisoners, but who were in fact acting as agents of the police.&nbsp; It was held, at pp.&nbsp;526‚Äë27, that:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">A person in authority means, generally speaking, anyone who has authority or control over the accused or over the proceedings or the prosecution against him. . . .

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">Thus, from its earliest inception in Canadian law, the question as to who should be considered as a person in authority depended on the extent to which the accused believed the person could influence or control the proceedings against him or her. &nbsp;The question is therefore approached from the viewpoint of the accused.&nbsp; See also <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">The law is settled that a person in authority is a person concerned with the prosecution who, in the opinion of the accused, can influence the course of the prosecution.&nbsp; The test to be applied in deciding whether statements made to persons connected in such a way with the prosecution are voluntary is subjective.&nbsp; In other words what did the accused think?&nbsp; Whom did he think he was talking to? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Was he under the impression that the failure to speak to this person, because of his power to influence the prosecution, would result in prejudice or did he think that a statement would draw some benefit or reward?&nbsp; If his mind was free of such impressions the person receiving this statement would not be considered a person in authority and the statement would be admissible.</p>

(2d) 511 (N.S.S.C.A.D.) (victim is a person in authority if the accused believed that the victim had control over the proceedings);<i> A.B.</i>, <i>supra</i> (a parent is not, in law, a person in authority if there is no close connection between the decision to call the authorities and the inducement to a child to make a statement); <i>R. v.

C.A.)(a social worker is a person in authority if the accused knew the social worker was investigating allegations of child abuse and believed it could lead to his arrest).&nbsp; These cases have not departed from the governing rule that defines a person in authority in relation to the accused‚Äôs perception of the receiver‚Äôs involvement with the investigation or prosecution of the crime nor have these decisions defined a person in authority solely in terms of the personal authority that a person might wield in relation to the accused.&nbsp; Moreover, in concluding that the receiver of the statement was a person in authority, the courts have consistently found the accused believed the receiver was allied with the state authorities and could influence the investigation or prosecution against the accused.</p>

24.4pt">Where an evidential burden for an issue rests on the defendant in a criminal case, for example self‚Äëdefence, the accused has the obligation to ensure that there is some evidence on the record to make it a live issue.&nbsp; The evidence necessary to satisfy an evidential burden may arise in the case for the Crown or the defence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:24.4pt">38<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the vast majority of cases, the accused will meet this evidential burden by showing the accused‚Äôs knowledge of the relationship between the receiver of the statement and the police or prosecuting authorities.&nbsp; For example, the fact that the statement was made to a police officer who was in uniform or identified himself or herself as a peace officer will satisfy the accused's evidential burden in relation to the person in authority requirement.&nbsp; See, e.g., <i>Morris v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1041, at p.&nbsp;1066.&nbsp; Once the accused satisfies this evidential burden, the ultimate burden of proof rests with the Crown.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. McKenzie</i>, [1965] 3 C.C.C. 6 (Alta. S.C.A.D.), at p.&nbsp;28.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Postman</i> (1977), 3 A.R. 524, at p.&nbsp;542, the Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division held, correctly in my view, that where a witness is not <i>prima facie</i> a person in authority (in that case, a doctor), ‚Äúit is open to defence counsel to challenge the <i>prima facie</i> case and require evidence to be given to determine the facts of the matter‚Äù.&nbsp; Thus, once the defence discharges its burden and establishes that there is an evidential basis to the claim that the receiver of a statement made by the accused is a person in authority, the burden shifts to the Crown to establish beyond a reasonable doubt either that the receiver is not a person in authority, or, if this burden cannot be discharged, that the statement was made voluntarily.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">It is a most important right of the accused to call witnesses and present argument separately on the issue of the admissibility of a statement directly after the Crown‚Äôs evidence on this matter has been adduced.&nbsp; This right would be totally lost if a statement of the accused could be admitted without a <i>voir dire</i> as part of the Crown‚Äôs evidence because nothing in that evidence cast doubt on its voluntariness. . . .&nbsp; The testimony of the accused may be the only evidence which indicates involuntariness.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">Although this statement of principle pertains to a <i>voir dire</i> held to determine voluntariness, it is also applicable to one held to determine whether the receiver of a statement made by the accused is a person in authority.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule which is still applicable in determining the admissibility of a statement made by an accused to a person in authority is that it must have been made voluntarily and must be the product of an operating mind.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule is based upon two fundamentally important concepts:&nbsp; the need to ensure the reliability of the statement and the need to ensure fairness by guarding against improper coercion by the state.&nbsp; This results in the requirement that the admission must <u>not</u> be obtained by either threats or inducements.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
</div> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>
<div class="Section35">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule is applicable when the accused makes a statement to a person in authority.&nbsp; Though no absolute definition of ‚Äúperson in authority‚Äù is necessary or desirable, it typically refers to those formally engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or prosecution of the accused.&nbsp; Thus, it would apply to person such as police officers and prison officials or guards.&nbsp; When the statement of the accused is made to a police officer or prison guard a <i>voir dire</i> should be held to determine its admissibility as a voluntary statement, unless the <i>voir dire</i> is waived by counsel for the accused.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those persons whom the accused reasonably believes are acting on behalf of the police or prosecuting authorities and could therefore influence or control the proceedings against him or her may also be persons in authority.&nbsp; That question will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue as to who is a person in authority must be resolved by considering it subjectively from the viewpoint of the accused.&nbsp; There must, however, be a reasonable basis for the accused‚Äôs belief that the person hearing the statement was a person in authority.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue will not normally arise in relation to undercover police officers.&nbsp; This is because the issue must be approached from the viewpoint of the accused.&nbsp; On that basis, undercover police officers will not usually be viewed by the accused as persons in authority.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ensuing <i>voir dire</i> the accused will have the evidential burden of demonstrating that there is a valid issue for consideration.&nbsp; If the accused meets the burden, the Crown will then have the persuasive burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the receiver of the statement was not a person in authority or if it is found that he or she was a person in authority, that the statement of the accused was made voluntarily.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:19.95pt;line-height:

At that time almost every serious crime was punishable by death or transportation. The law enforcement officers formed no disciplined police force and were not subject to effective control by the central government, watch committees or an inspectorate. There was no legal aid. There was no system of appeal. To crown it all the accused was unable to give evidence on his own behalf and was therefore largely at the mercy of any evidence, either perjured or oppressively obtained, that might be brought against him. The judiciary were therefore compelled to devise artificial rules designed to protect him against dangers now avoided by other and more rational means. Nevertheless, the rule has survived into the twentieth century, not only unmodified but developed. . . .</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">Clearly both objective and subjective elements are present in this definition.&nbsp; However, a consideration of subjective factors is relevant only in so far as they are linked to the police methods employed (<i>R</i>. <i>v.</i> <i>Amyot</i> (1990), 58 C.C.C.

In this regard, I am persuaded by the cogent reasoning of Laycraft C.J. in <i>R. v. Sweryda</i> (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 325 (Alta.

The usual method of analysis is thus reversed. One first uses voluntariness as the test to determine whether the maker of the threat or promise is a person in authority. If a threat or promise induced the statement, the analysis concludes at once because the maker thereby becomes a person in authority. Indeed, the rule as formulated might be stated in simpler terms without going through the formality (or the subterfuge) of finding the maker of the threat or promise to be a person in authority: If a statement is induced by a promise or a threat which the accused thinks the maker could make good, the statement is inadmissible.

M.C.H.</i> (1996), 91 O.A.C. 298), Finlayson J.A. addressed this situation as follows (at p.</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Shruti">302):</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">When a statement is made to a person or persons not ordinarily engaged in the arrest, detention, examination, or prosecution of accused persons, it appears to me that the defence has a responsibility to raise the issue at trial and ask for a voir dire to determine if the person to whom the confession was made was in fact a person in authority.&nbsp; The defence bears this responsibility because the subjective reaction of the accused to his or her interrogator is essential to the ultimate determination of voluntariness. Absent the presence of a conventional authority figure at the time when an inculpatory statement is made, the trial judge must be placed on notice that the voluntariness of the statement is a live issue.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">I agree with Finlayson J.A. that as a general rule the accused has the duty to request a <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> in the case of non-obvious persons in authority.&nbsp; Where requested, the trial judge has an obligation to grant the accused the opportunity to establish that the statement was made to a person in authority.</span></p>

Otherwise, it would serve no legitimate purpose to interrupt the trial to conduct a <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>

As a general rule, the accused bears the onus of requesting this trial within a trial. However, in exceptional circumstances, the evidence itself will require the trial judge to conduct a <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> <i>proprio motu</i>. </span></p>
