   <p class="Metadata"><span lang="EN-CA">ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.</span></p> 
   <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law—Two convictions for same act—Whether second conviction proper—Charges to be treated as alternatives—Whether unlawful sexual intercourse included offence of rape—Criminal Code, ss. 7(2), 11, 140, 143, 144, 146, 147, 535, 536, 537, 743(2).</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant was indicted jointly with another male person on two counts involving a thirteen year old girl, namely, rape contrary to s. 143 and unlawful carnal knowledge of a female under fourteen years of age contrary to s. 146(1) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>Following the direction of the trial judge the jury brought in a verdict of guilty on both counts and the accused was sentenced to two concurrent terms of ten years. The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the accused’s appeal without written or recorded reasons and leave to appeal to this Court was given on the question whether the accused, having been convicted of rape, should in respect of the same single act have also been convicted of sexual intercourse with a female under the age of fourteen, not being his wife, an issue which had not been raised in the Courts below.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Fauteux C.J., Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Laskin and Dickson JJ: Although there have been cases where multiple convictions were registered, when in substance only one “crime” has been committed, refusal to interfere on appeal was justified because only one sentence was imposed. The better practice, however, is to avoid multiple convictions <i>and </i>in relation to potentially multiple convictions, it is important to know the verdict on the first count since if that verdict is guilty</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 730]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">and the same or substantially the same elements make up the second count charged the situation invites the application of the rule against multiple convictions. While in the present case there is the superadded element of age in s. 146(1) this does not operate to distinguish unlawful carnal knowledge from rape. Age under fourteen is material where consent to the sexual intercourse is present but once that is ruled out it becomes meaningless as a distinguishing feature of the offence of rape and unlawful carnal knowledge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Fauteux C.J. and Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. <i>dissenting: </i>The appellant was not convicted twice in respect of the same offence. The cases dealing with double punishment are not relevant to the issue of law which is before us and which is the legal power to convict an accused of two separate offences in respect of the same act.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">THE CHIEF JUSTICE (<i>dissenting</i>)—For the reasons given by Mr.&nbsp;Justice Ritchie and the comments relevant to this case which I made in <i>Doré v. The Attorney General of </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span></i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[1]</span></span></span></span></a><i><span lang="EN-CA"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">MARTLAND J. (<i>dissenting</i>)—I agree with the reasons of my brother Ritchie. I would like to add the following comment. The point which is in issue in the present appeal was never raised at trial, or before the Court of Appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Presumably, when leave to appeal to this Court was granted it was felt that the outcome of the appeal, if successful, would have some practical favourable consequences for the appellant. However, in the course of his argument, counsel for the appellant conceded that if the appeal succeeded the appellant would not be entitled to obtain a new trial in respect of both the charges against him. He was still subject to the sentence on the charge of rape, which sentence was exactly the same as, and concurrent with, the sentence on the other charge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the result, therefore, the appeal to this Court constituted an academic exercise, the only result of which, if successful, will be to prevent the addition to the appellant’s already lengthy criminal record of a conviction for the crime of sexual intercourse with a female under the age of fourteen, not being his wife, which crime it is clear that he committed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Chief Justice and Abbott and Martland JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">RITCHIE J. (<i>dissenting</i>)—I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Laskin in which he has recounted the circumstances giving rise to this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The appeal came on for hearing pursuant to an order of this Court granting leave to appeal in accordance with the provisions of s. 618(1)(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The jurisdiction conferred by that section&nbsp;is, of course, confined to ques-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 732]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">tions of law in the strict sense and the order which was granted in the present case reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">IT IS ORDERED that leave to appeal be and the same is hereby granted <i>limited to </i>the question whether the accused, having been convicted of rape, should in respect of the same single act have also been convicted of sexual intercourse with a female under the age of fourteen, not being his wife.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(The italics are my own).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In my understanding it has been the general practice of this Court when hearing an appeal pursuant to an order granting leave to confine itself exclusively to the question or questions posed in such an order, and even if the order here in question had not contained express words of limitation, I think it would be contrary to this practice to entertain the appeal on any ground other than the one which is expressly specified.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is, therefore, important in my view to determine at the outset the exact limits of the question with which this appeal is concerned.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It will at once be apparent that the issue before us is confined to the validity of the second <i>conviction. </i>No question is raised as to the propriety of the judge’s action in sentencing the appellant as he did on both counts if the second conviction is valid, and indeed, while that was a matter over which the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction, this Court is not clothed with the same authority.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant was charged, together with one Wayne Ronald Constable, that he raped one Jacqueline Mary Chafe contrary to the <i>Criminal Code, </i>and second, that he had sexual intercourse with the same girl, she being a female under the age of fourteen years who was not his wife, contrary to the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The two accused were arraigned separately on each of the two charges and the appellant pleaded “not guilty” to both. The two offences with which the appellant was charged are defined in the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 733]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">following terms in ss. 143 and 146(1) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>as amended by 1972 (</span><span lang="EN-CA">Can.</span><span lang="EN-CA">), c. 13,s.70:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">143. A male person commits rape when he has sexual intercourse with a female person who is not his wife,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>without her consent, or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>with her consent if the consent</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(i) is extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(ii) is obtained by personating her husband, or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(iii) is obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">146. (1) Every male person who has sexual intercourse with a female person who</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>) is not his wife, and</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>is under the age of fourteen years,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or more, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Every one who commits the indictable offence of rape is also liable to imprisonment for life.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I think it of first importance to recognize that the offences created by ss. 143 and 146(1) are separate and distinct offences and it appears to be common ground that the latter offence is not included in the former. The fundamental difference between the two offences is that a conviction under s. 146(1) can only be sustained if the victim is under fourteen years of age, whereas the age of the victim forms no part of the offence described in s. 143. The provisions of s. 140 also make it clear that consent is no defence to a charge under s. 146(1), whereas, of course, lack of consent is an essential ingredient of rape.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 734]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It was contended on behalf of the appellant that as a conviction for rape negatives consent, it also precludes a conviction under s. 146(1) in respect of the same act because where a lack of consent has been proved, age ceases to be a distinguishing factor between the two offences. This reasoning appears to me to be predicated on the assumption that the only difference between the two offences is that consent is excluded as a defence to s. 146(1) by the provisions of s. 140 and to overlook the fact that an accused charged under s. 146(1) would be equally guilty under that section&nbsp;whether his victim had consented or not provided that she was under 14 years of age and not his wife. Consent or lack of consent form no part of the offence described in s. 146(1), but it contains an ingredient which is not included in a conviction for rape, namely, the age of the child victim.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The situation in the present case is that the act for which the appellant was convicted of rape also constituted the additional offence of having sexual intercourse with a female person under the age of fourteen years who was not his wife. The purpose and effect of s. 146(1) is in my view to protect female children under the age of fourteen years from sexual advances leading to intercourse by male persons over that age, (see s. 147) and I cannot subscribe to a result which relieves an assailant from the consequences of violating a child on the ground that his act also constitutes the crime of rape.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Under these circumstances I am unable to see how it can be said that the appellant did not commit both offences.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is contended, however, that, because it is an accepted principle of our law that no one shall be punished twice for the same offence, it must follow, according to the same principle, that nobody can be convicted more than once in</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 735]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">respect of the same act. The chief authority to which we were referred in support of this contention was the unanimous judgment of this Court in <i>Cox and Paton v. The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>where the accused had been convicted on two counts, each of which was found to be referrable to the same conspiracy and Cartwright J. (as he then was) held that both convictions could not stand on the ground that “It is the same conspiracy which is alleged in both counts and it would be contrary to the law that the accused should be punished more than once for the same offence.”, (page 516).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In that case the accused, having been charged with conspiracy, the essence of the offence was the illegal agreement. (See <i>Belyea v. the King</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[3]</span></span></span></a><i>, Paradis v.

There was but one agreement alleged and the fact that the conspirators were shown to have had more than one breach of the law in contemplation in forming that agreement did not convert the conspiracy into two offences so as to justify separate convictions in respect of each.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">With the greatest respect for those who may entertain a different opinion, I do not view the judgment in <i>Cox and Paton v.</i> <i>The Queen </i>as authority for the proposition that an accused cannot be charged and convicted on two separate offences when both those offences had been committed by means of a single act.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It appears to me that in enacting s. 11 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>Parliament recognized that more than one offence may be committed as a result of a single act. Section&nbsp;11 reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Where an act or omission is an offence under more than one Act of the Parliament of Canada, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does the act or makes the omission is,</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 736]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">unless a contrary intention appears, subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be punished more than once for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">A similar section&nbsp;appears as s. 33 of the <i>Interpretation Act </i>1889 (</span><span lang="EN-CA">U.K.</span><span lang="EN-CA">) c. 63 which reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Where an act or omission constituted an offence under two or more Acts, or both under an Act or at common law,… the offender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and punished under either or any of those Acts or at common law, but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In interpreting the effect of this section, Humphreys J. in <i>Rex v. Thomas</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[6]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>said at p. 204:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is not the law that a person shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same act; no one has ever said so in any case, and the Interpretation Act does not say so. What the Act says is that a person ‘shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence’. Not only is it not the law, but it never has been the law, and that it is not the law was expressly decided in the highest criminal Court in the land then existing the Court for the Consideration of Crown Cases Reserved, as far back as 1867, in <i>Morris </i>(1867), 10 Cox C.C. 480.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the <i>Thomas </i>case the accused had been convicted of assault and was thereafter tried again for manslaughter arising out of the same facts, his victim having died after his first conviction as a result of the assault, but the observations of Humphreys J. are by no means limited to such a case as can be seen from the reasons for judgment of Lord Reading in <i>R. v.

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is against the very first principles of the criminal law that a man should be placed twice in jeopardy upon the same facts: the offences are practically the same, though not their legal operation.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As to this Lord Reading said, at p. 575:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is quite plain that the learned judge did not intend to lay down and did not lay down as a general principle of law that a man cannot be placed twice in jeopardy upon the same facts if the offences are different. The statement obviously refers to a case where the offences are the same…</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Being satisfied that the first and second counts of this indictment charge separate offences and that the second is not included in the first, I think it must follow that the defence of <i>autrefois convict </i>is not available to the appellant, but it was strongly contended that the plea of <i>res judicata </i>or issue estoppel was available in this case to preclude a conviction being entered on the second count after a finding of guilty on the first. In regard to this last argument I have been greatly assisted by a textbook entitled <i>Res Judicata </i>prepared by Spencer-Bower and Turner 2nd Ed. (1969) where it is said at p. 391, para. 479:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">As has been pointed out in a previous chapter, the plea of <i>autrefois convict </i>is the process by which the doctrine of merger in judgment becomes effective in criminal jurisdiction. Once the accused has been tried for an offence, and convicted of it, that is an end to his criminal liability, and his conduct cannot serve as the basis of a second accusation of the same crime. As in civil, so in criminal law—<i>transit in rem judicatam: </i>the criminal liability of the prisoner for the offence which he has committed is merged in his</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 738]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">conviction for that offence, once it has been obtained, and his liability to be punished is discharged by the punishment (if any) which has been inflicted in respect thereof.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is particularly to be noticed, however, that while the maxim <i>nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto </i>forbids a second verdict of guilty for the same <i>crime, </i>it does not forbid a second prosecution for the same <i>conduct, </i>in cases in which such conduct may amount to two separate crimes. Whether it is just to prosecute an accused again after one conviction, may be debated on the facts of the particular case; but the maxim will not forbid it. Neither will an exemption from criminal liability on the second charge follow from the application of the maxim <i>transit in rem judicatam. </i>What has passed into <i>res judicata </i>is the <i>offence </i>of which he was convicted, together with those other offences of which he could have been convicted on the same facts on the same indictment.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I think it is clear that the words “same indictment” as employed in the last sentence of this quotation are, for the purpose of this case, synonymous with “second count”. (See s. 520 (2) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The comment made by Lord Morris in the course of his very comprehensive judgment in <i>Connelly v.

Lord Morris there said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The principle seems clearly to have been recognised that if someone had been either convicted or acquitted of an offence he could not later be charged with the same offence or with what was in effect the same offence. In determining whether or not he was being so charged the court was not confined to an examination of the record. The reality of the matter was to be ascertained. That, however, did not mean that if two separate offences were committed at the same time a conviction or an acquittal in respect of one would be any bar to a subsequent prosecution in respect of the other. It was the offence or offences that had to be considered. Was there in substance one</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 739]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">offence—or had someone committed two or more offences?</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In considering the question posed by the last sentence in this passage, I think it desirable to make reference to the case of <i>The King v. Quon</i><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[10]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>and <i>R. v.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the <i>Quon </i>case the accused had been charged on two counts. The first laid under s. 446(<i>c</i>) of the <i>Code </i>alleged robbery while armed; the second laid under s. 122 of the <i>Code </i>alleged possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while committing “any criminal offence”. At his trial Quon pleaded guilty to the first charge and he was also found guilty of the second offence and sentenced to two years on each count. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on the second count and this decision was affirmed on appeal to this Court. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr.&nbsp;Justice Kellock made it clear that his reason for affirming the dismissal on the second count was that he regarded the offence there charged, not as a separate offence, but as an essential part of the offence charged in the first count. In the course of these reasons he said, at p. 525:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Coming to section&nbsp;446(<i>c</i>), Parliament has by this provision, declared that for that offence, involving as one of its main elements, the presence on the offender of an offensive weapon, the penalty may be imprisonment for life and whipping. That is expressly the penalty for the totality of that conduct. I do not think therefore, that there is to be attributed to Parliament the intention that one part of that conduct (where the weapon in question is a firearm) may be made the subject of a separate charge under section&nbsp;122,…</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In reaching this conclusion, Mr.&nbsp;Justice Kellock had occasion to quote from the judgment of</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 740]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Blackburn J. in <i>Wemyss v. Hopkins</i><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[12]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>the passage to which reference has been made in the reasons for judgment of my brother Laskin, the most relevant part of which reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The defence does not arise on a plea of autrefois convict, but on the well established rule at common law, that when a person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a court of competent jurisdiction, <i>transit in rem judicatam, </i>that is, the conviction shall be a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be punished again for the same matter;…</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">At the conclusion of this quotation, Mr.&nbsp;Justice Kellock observed:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The above principle is embodied in section&nbsp;14 of the <i>Code. </i>The common law principle is as applicable, in my opinion, in the case of two sections&nbsp;of the same statute as in the case of separate statutes.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Reference to the <i>Criminal Code </i>as it existed in 1948 makes it plain that Mr.&nbsp;Justice Kellock was referring to s. 15 rather than s. 14 in making the last-quoted comment. Section&nbsp;14 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>as it then read abolished the distinction between felony and misdemeanour, but s. 15 was the precursor of the present s. 11, and I am in any event in agreement that the provisions of that section, viewed in the light of what Humphreys J. said in <i>R. v. Thomas, supra, </i>respecting the equivalent English section, are just as applicable in the case of two sections&nbsp;of the <i>Criminal Code </i>as they are in the case of two statutes. One act may thus be the subject of convictions under two sections&nbsp;of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>but only one punishment can be imposed for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The clear distinction between the <i>Quon </i>case and the case at bar is that the age of the victim is not one of the essential elements in the offence of rape and the same distinction applies to the case of <i>Rex v. Siggins, supra, </i>in which the reasons for judgment delivered by MacKay J.A.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 741]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">on behalf of the majority of the Court were clearly predicated on the assumption that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The offence of theft where the person charged is the actual thief, necessarily involves the taking of possession by him of the article stolen, and the person found in the possession of goods which he himself has stolen has also committed the offence of having in his possession goods knowing them to have been stolen.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I do not purport to either approve or disapprove this assumption, but I mention it simply to indicate that the counts charging unlawful possession in that case were quashed because the Court took the view that theft “necessarily involves the taking of possession” whereas, as I have said, rape does not necessarily involve an offence under s. 146(1).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In summary, the position in the present case is this. The appellant has been charged with two separate and distinct offences under the <i>Criminal Code. </i>He was tried in respect of both charges. He was guilty of both offences. In those circumstances, on what basis can it be said that he cannot be convicted of both? There is nothing in the <i>Criminal Code </i>to preclude it. He was not being convicted twice in respect of the same offence. The cases dealing with double punishment are not relevant to the issue of law which is before us, which is concerned with the legal power to convict in respect of two offences, and not with the question of sentence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">For all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Laskin and Dickson JJ. was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">LASKIN J.—There are no facts in dispute in this appeal and only the barest narration is necessary for its disposition. The appellant accused was indicted jointly with another male person on two counts of sexual offences against a girl admittedly thirteen years of age at the time. The offences charged were (1) rape, con-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 742]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">trary to s. 143 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>and (2) unlawful carnal knowledge of a female under fourteen years of age, contrary to s. 146(1).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The relevant portion of the trial judge’s charge to the jury in respect of these two counts was as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">As to Kienapple, your possible verdicts are guilty or not guilty on Count 1, rape; if you find him guilty on Count 1, then you need not consider any of the included offences that I am about to mention and mentioned previously and you may also proceed at once to find him guilty on Count 2, because a conviction for rape also includes a finding of intercourse with a girl. It is admitted that she is under fourteen. So that you may find him guilty on Counts 1 and 2, but if you find him not guilty on Count 1, that is of rape, then you should consider whether it has been proven that he is guilty in Count 2, that is of having had sexual intercourse with a girl under fourteen. If you find him guilty of rape, then you stop right there because that takes care of the other count. If you find him not guilty of rape, go on to consider whether there was intercourse in Count 2.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The jury, on this direction, brought in a verdict of guilty on both counts, and the accused was subsequently sentenced to two concurrent terms of imprisonment of ten years. The Court of Appeal of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Ontario</span><span lang="EN-CA"> dismissed the accused’s appeal without written or recorded reasons. Leave to appeal to this Court was given on the following question:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Whether the accused, having been convicted of rape, should in respect of the same single act have also been convicted of sexual intercourse with a female under the age of fourteen, not being his wife.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I should say that the issue raised by this question was not raised in the Courts below.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 743]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Sections&nbsp;143 and 146(1), as amended by 1972 (</span><span lang="EN-CA">Can.</span><span lang="EN-CA">), c. 13, s. 70, reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">143. A male person commits rape when he has sexual intercourse with a female person who is not his wife,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>) without her consent, or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>with her consent if the consent</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(i) is extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(ii) is obtained by personating her husband, or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(iii) is obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">146. (1) Every male person who has sexual intercourse with a female person who</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>) is not his wife, and</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>is under the age of fourteen years,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or more, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The punishment for rape is prescribed by s. 144 which, as also amended by 1972 (</span><span lang="EN-CA">Can.</span><span lang="EN-CA">), c. 13, s. 70, reads now as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Every one who commits rape is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">At the material time, so far as the charges against the accused were concerned, the punishments provisions for the two offences also included liability to be whipped. Section&nbsp;140 is material to the definition of the offence under s. 146(1) in providing that the fact that there was consent to the commission of the offence is not a defence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is common ground that unlawful carnal knowledge under s. 146(1) is not an included offence on a charge of rape. Indeed, it could not be because s. 146(1) embraces two situations, one of which has all the ingredients of rape but is in respect of a female under age fourteen, and the second is inconsistent with rape in that there is consent. In a case therefore where there has</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 744]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">been sexual intercourse with a girl under age fourteen and the question of consent is in issue (the burden being on the Crown on a charge of rape to negative it beyond a reasonable doubt), it is entirely understandable that the Crown would seek to indict an accused on two counts, as in the present case. Where the jury brings in a verdict of guilty on the first count of rape, there being only one act of sexual intercourse involved with the same girl, it has perforce found that the sexual intercourse was without consent and there can be no finding of guilt on the second count on the basis of consent, albeit this is not a defence. It is said, however, that there is no inconsistency in finding the accused guilty under s. 146(1) simply on the basis of the verdict of guilty of rape; such a finding, it is contended, merely fastens on that aspect of s. 146(1) which I described as paralleling all the ingredients of rape but in respect of a female under age fourteen.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is plain, of course, that Parliament has defined two offences in ss. 143 and 146(1), but there is an overlap in the sense that one embraces the other when the sexual intercourse has been with a girl under age fourteen without her consent. It is my view that in such a case, if the accused has been charged, first, with rape and, secondly, with a s. 146(1) offence, and there is a verdict of guilty of rape, the second charge falls as an alternative charge and the jury should be so directed. Correlatively, however, the jury should also be directed that if they find the accused not guilty of rape they may still find him guilty under s. 146(1) where sexual intercourse with a girl under age fourteen has been proved.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The rationale of my conclusion that the charges must be treated as alternative if there is</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 745]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">a verdict of guilty of rape on the first count, that there should not be multiple convictions for the same delict against the same girl, has a long history in the common law. A convenient beginning is with the maxim expressed in <i>Hudson v. Lee</i><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[13]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>at p. 990, “nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto”, which although framed in terms of double punishment, has come to be understood as directed also against double or multiple convictions; in short, <i>nemo bis vexari </i>as well as <i>nemo bis puniri. </i>This was exemplified in the unanimous judgment of this Court in <i>Cox and Paton v. The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[14]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>which involved, <i>inter alia, </i>convictions of the accused on two counts, numbered (1) and (3), for conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to defraud, both relating to the same money and securities. Cartwright J., as he then was, speaking for this Court, held that the Manitoba Court of Appeal had properly quashed one of the convictions. He put the matter in these words (at p. 516):</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The reason that the convictions on counts 1 and 3 cannot both be supported is not that they are “mutually destructive”, as was said of the counts in <i>R. v. Mills </i>[1959] Cr.L.Rev. 662, but rather that if both were allowed to stand the accused would in reality be convicted twice of the same offence. It is the same conspiracy which is alleged in the two counts and it would be contrary to law that the accused should be punished more than once for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Of course, in a strict sense, <i>Cox and Paton </i>was no more a case of multiple convictions for the same offence than is the present case. Rather it was a case, as is the present one, of multiple convictions for the same matter. It is clear to me that in the context of the decision in <i>Cox and Paton </i>the word “offence” was used in</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 746]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">the sense attributed to it by Pollock B. in <i>The Queen v.

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">At the trial it was proved on behalf of the prisoner, and admitted by counsel for the prosecution, that the first four counts of the indictment referred to the same matter as the offence mentioned in the record. In substance, therefore, the plea and the evidence establish that there was but one offence, and that the acts done by the defendant in respect of which he was convicted, by whatever legal name they might be called, were the same as those to which the indictment referred, and therefore the rule of law Nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto applies, and if the prisoner were guilty of the modified crime only he could not be guilty of the same acts with the addition of malice and design.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">That case involved a charge of wounding laid under a statute. There had been a previous conviction for assault at common law, and although the offences were different it was held that the accused could not be convicted again for the same matter. Reference was made to <i>The Queen v.</i> <i>Miles </i>by Humphreys J. in <i>Rex v.</i> <i>Thomas</i><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[16]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>at p. 30 as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The accused entered a plea in bar in which he alleged that the assault of which he had been convicted previously and the wounding and battery in the first four counts of the indictment, were one and the same assault and battery and not other and different. The Court for the Consideration of Crown Cases Reserved upheld the appellant’s plea, which they regarded as an informal plea of autrefois convict, and it is important to examine the reasons why they so held. All the judges considered that the plea and the evidence established that there was one offence only committed by the accused. It was one and the same assault, although in three of the counts that assault was alleged to have been accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I think the fact that the appellant had been convicted by justices under one Act of Parliament for what amounted to an assault is a bar to a conviction under another Act of Parliament for the same assault. The defence does not arise on a plea of autrefois convict, but on the well-established rule at common law, that where a person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a Court of competent jurisdiction, transit in rem judicatam, that is, the conviction shall be a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be punished again for the same matter; otherwise there might be two different punishments for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This statement was quoted with approval by Kellock J. in <i>The King v.

Hopkins </i>and like cases for the proposition that “the court in its criminal jurisdiction retained a power to prevent a repetition of prosecutions even when it did not fall within the exact limits of the pleas in bar”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The pleas in bar are dealt with in ss. 535 to 537 and s. 743(2) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>So far as <i>autrefois convict </i>is concerned, the relevant provisions, for present purposes, are ss. 536 and 537(1)(<i>a</i>) which speak, respectively, of “the identity of the charges” and, in that connection, “that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial is the same in whole or in part”. This last quoted provision in s. 537(1)(<i>a</i>) suggests that, so far at least as successive prosecutions are involved, the plea of <i>autrefois convict </i>goes beyond strict identity of offences and is akin to <i>res judicata. </i>But even if the pleas of <i>autrefois </i>be narrowly construed,</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 748]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA">res judicata </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">as a common law defence to a charge is preserved by s. 7(2) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the term <i>res judicata </i>best expresses the theory of precluding multiple convictions for the same delict, although the matter is the basis of two separate offences. In <i>Studies in Criminal Law </i>(1964) by Morris and Howard, the authors in an essay entitled <i>Res Judicata in the Criminal Law, </i>at p. 252, say that <i>“res judicata </i>as a general principle concerns itself only with the question whether an issue has been decided not with the question in whose favour the decision went”. Although <i>transit in rem judicatam, </i>as used by Blackburn J. in <i>Wemyss v. Hopkins, supra, </i>is more appropriate to a plea of <i>autrefois acquit </i>or issue estoppel, it is clear that he was concerned with a matter more akin to double jeopardy and <i>autrefois convict, </i>as was Cartwright J. in the <i>Cox and Paton </i>case. Where there has been a previous conviction of an accused, whether in a former trial or on one count of a multicount indictment, issue estoppel is obviously an inappropriate term to urge against a further conviction of another offence. So too would be <i>autrefois convict </i>in its strict connotation; hence, the utility of <i>res judicata.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">On this view, nothing is added or subtracted by s. 11 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>which reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Where an act or omission is an offence under more than one Act of the Parliament of Canada, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does the act or makes the omission is,</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 749]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">unless a contrary intention appears, subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be punished more than once for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This provision had its origin, as a general provision, in <i>An Act respecting Punishments, Pardons and the Commutation of Sentences, </i>R.S.C. 1886, c. 181, s. 3 where it was as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Whenever any offender is punishable under two or more Acts or two or more sections&nbsp;of the same Act, he may be tried and punished under any of such Acts or sections, but no person shall be twice punished for the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The above-quoted s. 3 was an amalgam of earlier legislation having a particular application and found in <i>The Offences against the Person Act, </i>1869 (Can.), c. 20, ss. 40 and 41, <i>The Wreck and Salvage Act, </i>1873 (Can.), c. 55, s. 33, and <i>The Breaches of Contract Act, </i>1877 (Can.), c. 35, s. 6. It was carried literally into the first <i>Criminal Code, </i>1892 (Can.), c. 29, s.&nbsp;933, but in the 1906 revision it underwent a change to conform with s. 33 of the United Kingdom <i>Interpretation Act, </i>1889 (U.K.), c. 63. The present s. 11 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>is in substance a reenactment of the </span><span lang="EN-CA">United Kingdom</span><span lang="EN-CA"> s. 33, but with a slight alteration in language. In its material terms, it conforms to the comparable </span><span lang="EN-CA">United Kingdom</span><span lang="EN-CA"> section. I find it a curious provision because in its opening words (“where an act or omission is an offence under more than one Act…”) it appears to reflect the maxim <i>nemo bis vexari, </i>and yet in its concluding words (“not liable to be punished more than once for the same offence”) it reflects the maxim <i>nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto’.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Humphreys J. in <i>Rex v. Thomas, supra, </i>insisted on a literal application of those concluding words, rejecting a text-book gloss on them as embracing “act” and “cause” as well as “offence” in the strict sense. I do not think that his illustration of successive successful prosecu-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 750]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">tions for assault and for manslaughter (after the assault victim dies), as shown in <i>Regina v. Morris</i><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[20]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>is a convincing support for reading s. 33 with literal emphasis on its concluding words and no emphasis on its opening words. That situation and the one that was presented in <i>Rex v. Thomas </i>itself (conviction of wounding with intent to murder, followed by an indictment for murder when the victim dies) can stand on their own without warranting a restrictive reading of the English s. 33 and our s. 11. The ensuing death brings into view a new relevant element not present when the first conviction occurred. That is not so in the case at bar. I would note, further, that if manslaughter and assault were charged in the same indictment the accused could not be convicted of both because of the included offence rule.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I cannot view s. 11 as modifying the scope of <i>res judicata, </i>let alone the scope of the pleas of <i>autrefois </i>as defined in ss. 535 to 537 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The relevant inquiry so far as <i>res judicata </i>is concerned is whether the same cause or matter (rather than the same offence) is comprehended by two or more offences. Moreover, it cannot be the case that if an accused is tried on several counts charging different offences, he is liable to be convicted and sentenced on each count, and yet if he was tried and convicted on one only he would be entitled to set up the defence of <i>res judicata </i>as a defence to other charges arising out of the same cause or matter.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Although there have been cases where multiple convictions were registered, when in substance only one “crime” has been committed, refusal to interfere on appeal was justified on</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 751]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">the “no substantial wrong” basis because only one sentence was imposed: see <i>Rex v.

Arial">[22]</span></span></span></a><i>. </i>The better practice, however, is to avoid multiple convictions, as was done in the <i>Cox and Paton </i>case, and earlier by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Regina v. Siggins</i><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

Siggins </i>was a not uncommon case of charging an alleged thief, found in possession of stolen goods, with both theft and unlawful possession. It was there said (at p. 285) that</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown is entitled to lay both charges against him, but at the trial, if the jury convict of theft they should not convict on the charge of unlawful possession. If they acquit on the charge of theft they may then consider and, if they see fit to do so, convict on the charge of unlawful possession.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In short, in relation to potentially multiple convictions, it is important to know the verdict on the first count, just as in the case of successive prosecutions it is important to know the result of the first trial: see Friedland, <i>Double Jeopardy </i>(1969), at p. 94.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">If there is a verdict of guilty on the first count and the same or substantially the same elements make up the offence charged in a second count, the situation invites application of a rule against multiple convictions: see <i>Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I test the matter in two other ways. If an accused may be charged on two counts, as in the present case, and may properly be found guilty on each for the one act of sexual intercourse with the same girl, it should be open to the Crown to charge him successively in the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 752]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">same way. If it obtains a verdict of guilty of rape it should be entitled to prefer another charge under s. 146(1) in order to obtain another verdict of guilty and seek a further consecutive sentence. Yet it seems clear enough that on the second charge, <i>res judicata </i>would be a complete defence since all the elements and facts supporting the conviction of rape would necessarily be the same under s. 146(1). Moreover, since the occurrence involved a proved negation of consent, there could be no conviction under the second aspect of s. 146(1) when there has been a conviction of rape.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In saying that <i>res judicata </i>(as an expression broader than <i>autrefois convict) </i>would be a complete defence, I am applying the <i>bis vexari </i>principle against successive prosecutions, a principle that, according to Morris and Howard, in the essay mentioned earlier, is grounded on the Court’s power to protect an individual from an undue exercise by the Crown of its power to prosecute and punish.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The second test is to reverse the order of the counts in the present case. If on the first charge of an offence under s. 146(1) the jury brings in a verdict of guilty, it would be inconsistent to find an accused guilty on a second count of rape because there may have been consent; and even if not, the considerations underlying <i>res judicata </i>would preclude a verdict of guilty of rape. Of course, if on a first count under s. 146(1) the accused was found not guilty, there could obviously be no finding of guilty of rape unless on the basis that the girl involved was over age fourteen; apart from that, there has been either no sexual intercourse proved even if there was no consent, or there has been no sexual intercourse proved albeit there was consent.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 753]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Parliament’s power to constitute two separate offences out of the same matter is not in question, but unless there is a clear indication that multiple prosecutions and, indeed, multiple convictions are envisaged, the common law principle expressed in the <i>Cox and Paton </i>case should be followed. Neither the definitions of the respective offences nor their history gives any support to the view that that common law principle has been ousted. The limits of punishment are the same, and I have already spoken of the ingredients of the respective offences. As a matter of history, the present s. 146(1) has its origin in s. 269 of the original <i>Criminal Code </i>1892 (Can.), c. 29, which used the phrase “carnally knows” instead of “sexual intercourse” both for that offence and for rape. Section&nbsp;269 was taken from s. 39 of the <i>Offences against the Person Act, </i>R.S.C. 1886, c. 162 which, as amended by 1890 (Can.), c.&nbsp;37, s. 12 raised the age ingredient from ten years to fourteen and added whipping to the prescribed punishment of a term for life or for not less than five years. When the <i>Offences against the Person Act </i>was first enacted in Canada by 1869, c. 20, carnal knowledge of a girl under ten was a capital offence under s. 51, as was rape; but, unlike rape, which remained a capital offence until the enactment of 1953-1954 (Can.), c. 51, s. 136 (although whipping was added in 1921 to the alternative maximum punishment of life imprisonment), the maximum punishment for unlawful carnal knowledge was changed to a life term by 1877 (Can.), c. 28, s.&nbsp;2.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">If any conclusion can be drawn from this short history, it is that carnal knowledge of a victim under age ten, and later under age fourteen, with its lesser punishment after 1877 (and until that for rape was changed), was regarded</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 754]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">as an alternative charge to rape, unnecessary where there was no consent (since age was not and is not a necessary averment in rape) but available where proof of want of consent could not be made or was doubtful. As a practical matter, this situation invited statutory reform to make it possible for a jury to return a verdict of guilty of unlawful carnal knowledge on a charge of rape of a girl under fourteen. In </span><span lang="EN-CA">England</span><span lang="EN-CA">, this situation was met by the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, </i>1885 (</span><span lang="EN-CA">U.K.</span><span lang="EN-CA">), c. 69, s. 9, and similar enactments were made in the Australian States: see Howard, <i>Australian Criminal Law </i>(2nd ed. 1970), pp. 172-3. The English provision was continued under s. 37 of the <i>Sexual Offences Act, </i>1956 (U.K.), c. 69, but was repealed by s. 10 and Schedule 3, s. 13(1)(d)(i) of the <i>Criminal Law Act, </i>1967 (U.K.), c. 58; and see <i>Regina v. Hodgson</i><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">We have never had legislation of that kind in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA">, and hence we continue to be governed by the law as to included offences, which excludes a conviction under s. 146(1) on a charge of rape. <i>Rex v. Marcus and Richmond</i><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[27]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>a judgment of the Ontario Appellate Division, is particularly illustrative. The accused was charged with rape the victim being a girl under age fourteen. There was some question at the trial whether the Crown proved want of consent, and the trial judge charged the jury, wrongly, that it was open to them to bring in a verdict of guilty of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under age fourteen. In setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial on the charge of rape the Court added (at p. 166) that “it is probable that the Crown will see fit to lay a further charge based upon the provisions of sec.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 755]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">301 [now s. 146(1)]”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the circumstances of the present case, the superadded element of age in s. 146(1) does not operate to distinguish unlawful carnal knowledge from rape. Age under fourteen is certainly material where consent to the sexual intercourse is present; but once that is ruled out, as it is in the present case, it becomes meaningless as a distinguishing feature of the offences of rape and unlawful carnal knowledge. No doubt, it can be taken into account on sentence under s. 146(1), but, equally, it can be considered under s. 143; and I can see no basis for departing from the principle under discussion if the age of the victim happens to be thirteen instead of fifteen when the maximum punishment is the same under both s. 143 and s. 146(1).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the result, I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction for unlawful carnal knowledge under s. 146(1), and, of course, the concurrent sentence of ten years imposed in consequence of that conviction must also fall.</span></p>
