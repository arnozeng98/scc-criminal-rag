<p class="Metadata"><span lang="EN-CA">ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF </span><span lang="EN-CA">NEW BRUNSWICK</span><span lang="EN-CA">, APPEAL DIVISION</span></p>

<p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Confessions and
admissions—Rights of the accused—Voir dire—Failure to charge jury as to
evidence of accomplice/ accessory after the fact—Whether witness accomplice/
accessory—Defence of drunkenness—Criminal Code, s.&nbsp;613(1)(b)(iii).</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant was tried on a charge of murder
following the death, after a vicious beating, of the woman with whom he was
living. There was little room for doubt that the deceased died as a result of
the beating administered by the appellant. The appellant was reported to have
made the observation in a tavern on the day after, “I beat her up; I don’t know
if she is alive or dead”. The appellant was found guilty at what was his second
trial on the same charge, his conviction at an earlier trial having been set
aside and a new trial directed (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 540.</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The grounds of appeal to this Court were that
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the trial judge did not err in
law, (first) in not holding a <i>voir dire </i>for various statements allegedly
made by the appellant, (second) in not instructing the jury that the evidence
of a witness, C.T., who had been present at the beating, should be treated as
that of an accomplice, and (third) in finding that lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death
is not a “defence” to a charge of murder, and therefore erred in not holding
that the evidence of drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict
to manslaughter. The first alleged error related to statements made by the
appellant to two uniformed police officers alerted by C.T., an acquaintance of
the appellant, when they arrived at the appellant’s room to find the appellant
standing by the bed on which the victim lay unconscious, with C.T. sitting
beside her.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1042]</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ.: dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: In the particular circumstances of the
case the trial judge was in error in admitting the statements made by the
appellant at the time that the police officers arrived at his room. The police
officers were in uniform and the girl’s condition must have made it obvious
that they were investigating at least a serious case of assault. Appellant’s
counsel however made no objection to the absence of a <i>voir dire </i>notwithstanding
that one had been held at the first trial and this taken in conjunction with
the mass of other evidence made it appropriate to apply s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)
of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">While C.T. was present during the terrible
events of the night and morning in question and had taken no steps to stop the
appellant in his actions this did not mean that he should have been treated
either as an accomplice or as an accessory. A person does not become an
accomplice merely by witnessing an act and failing to intervene to prevent it.
Further the evidence of two statements as to the victim’s condition to the
effect that she was alright, merely sleeping, and that nothing happened, when
read in light of s.&nbsp;23(1) of the <i>Code</i>, which defines an accessory
after the fact as one who knowing that a person had been a party to an offence
receives, comforts or assists him for the purpose of enabling his escape did
not justify the conclusion that C.T. was an accessory.</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, the Court of Appeal was in error
when it said “…lack of knowledge, due to intoxication, that bodily harm
inflicted by any person is likely to cause death is not a defence to a charge
of murder”. Notwithstanding this error there was however no justification for
the further allegation that the evidence of drunkenness justified a reduction
of the verdict to manslaughter.</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-CA"> Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. <i>dissenting</i>: Under these
circumstances the two police officers when in the apartment were regarded by
C.T. and the accused as “persons in authority” and were so acting. While not
holding that counsel for the appellant waived the requirement of a <i>voir dire</i>,
or even that such a waiver is possible, these facts and the mass of other
evidence justified the application of s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Code.</i>
The admissibility of the very brief exculpatory statement without determining its
voluntary character caused no substantial miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1043]</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">As to the second ground of appeal, a person
merely witnessing an act does not thereby become an accomplice. Indeed counsel
for the appellant in his address to the jury, although he attacked most
vigorously C.T.’s credibility did not imply that C.T. might have taken any part
in beating the victim. Nonetheless C.T.’s statements to the police officer,
“Oh, she’s alright, she’s just sleeping” and “nothing happened” were false statements
serving to conceal evidence and exonerate the appellant and C.T. in effect so
admitted in his cross-examination. C.T. was therefore an accessory. As an
accessory after the fact is “particeps criminis”, and so an accomplice, the
judge should have given an “accomplice warning”. In view of the fact that C.T.
was demonstrably a most unreliable witness, and of the thrust of his evidence,
it was possible to say that a jury given the proper warning could not, acting
judicially, have failed to convict the appellant. Upon this ground the appeal
should have been allowed and a new trial directed.</span></p>

<p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">On the third ground of appeal, the trial
judge was doubtful that the jury could find that the appellant could have
formed the necessary specific intent. It was for the Appeal Division to satisfy
itself not that there was evidence but that the weight of such evidence was not
so weak as to make the verdict of the jury unreasonable, a requirement which
falls short of requiring the Appeal Division to substitute its opinion for that
of the jury.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">SPENCE J. (<i>dissenting</i>)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick
pronounced on July 28, 1977. By that judgment, the Appeal Division affirmed the
conviction of the appellant on </span><span lang="EN-CA">June 5, 1976</span><span lang="EN-CA">, by a judge and jury on the charge</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">THAT he did on or about the 5th of January,
A.D. 1974 at the City of Fredericton, in the County of York and Province of New
Brunswick, unlawfully cause the death of Linda Diana Hitchcock and did thereby
commit murder punishable by life imprisonment, contrary to Section 218(2) of
the Criminal Code of Canada and amendments thereto.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I shall recite the facts as set out by Limerick
J.A. in his reasons for judgment for the Appeal Division and refer hereafter to
any additional facts which are relevant to these my reasons. Limerick J.A.
said:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">At 8:20 a.m. on </span><span lang="EN-CA">January 5th, 1974</span><span lang="EN-CA">, Csts. Arbeau and Larder
of the City of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Fredericton</span><span lang="EN-CA">
police force received a radio call as a result of which they proceeded to the
Windsor Hotel, a combined rooming house and hotel, at </span><span lang="EN-CA">151
 Westmorland Street</span><span lang="EN-CA"> in the City of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Fredericton</span><span lang="EN-CA"> to assist in taking a patient
to the hospital.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">On entering room No. 25, occupied by the
appellant, they found the deceased, Linda Diana Hitchcock, lying crosswise on a
bed. Carl Taylor, occupant of room No. 23 was sitting on the bed and the
appellant was standing nearby. Miss Hitchcock was unconscious, her eyes were
partly open and her breathing was shallow and labourous.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Cst. Arbeau asked what the problem was and
the appellant replied that she had been drinking all night and had fallen down
the stairs on her way to the bathroom. After communicating with police
headquarters by radio, Cst. Larder carried the 90 pound Miss Hitchcock to the
police car and placed her in the rear seat and the appellant sat with the
girl’s head on his lap. The police drove the car to the hospital and delivered
Miss Hitchcock to the emergency ward where she was examined by an intern and
two doctors, who then had her removed to the intensive care unit of the
hospital. She was pronounced dead the following day.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Medical evidence established there were
multiple bruises and cigarette burns on her arms, legs and body, a raised</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1045]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">lump on one temple and a cut in her scalp
at the back of her head as well as bruises, some of which were recent and
others several days old.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">An autopsy disclosed death was caused by a
massive subdural haematoma resulting from the tearing of the sagittal vein
lying between the two hemispheres of the brain which had caused internal
pressure in the skull forcing the lower portion of the brain into the opening
at the base of the skull and so damaging the part of the brain which controls
the vital functions of the body, resulting in the paralysis of these vital
functions.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The evidence discloses that for some months
prior to Miss Hitchcock’s death she had been living with the appellant in
apartment No. 25, a two room apartment, in the Windsor Hotel. About 10:00 p.m.
on the night of January 4th she had gone to the Canadian Legion dance in
Marysville with Darrell White, Marjorie Arbeau and Kenny Hanson. They left the
dance about </span><span lang="EN-CA">1:30 a.m.</span><span lang="EN-CA"> and after
eating at a restaurant they, in company with Gerald Peterson, returned to the
Windsor Hotel to apartment No. 20 where Mr.&nbsp;White and Miss Arbeau lived.
The deceased then left apartment No. 20 to find the appellant and brought him
back to that apartment.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Later that night Mr.&nbsp;White and Miss
Arbeau went for a drive leaving the appellant, the deceased, Gerald Peterson
and Kenny Hanson in White’s apartment. The appellant struck the deceased both
before and after Mr.&nbsp;White and Miss Arbeau left the apartment. On the
occasion of the second slapping when told by Kenny Hanson to leave her alone,
the appellant left the apartment. He later returned and carried the deceased
out of the apartment.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Between 5:30 and </span><span lang="EN-CA">6:00 a.m.</span><span lang="EN-CA"> several of the tenants heard loud
talking and shouting and two heavy thuds from the area of Carl Taylor’s
apartment (No. 23) just down the hall from that of the appellant.
Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson, who had an apartment across the hall from No. 23, removed her
children from their bedroom around 5:30 a.m. on that morning because of loud
talking, crying and noises eminating from </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s apartment. She overheard the deceased crying and say to the
appellant “Please don’t hit me any more”. She also heard the deceased ask Carl
Taylor to make the appellant stop hitting her. Through the keyhole in her
bedroom she saw the appellant through the open door of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s apartment seated in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s apartment. She heard the appellant say he wouldn’t hit her any
more and later again heard the deceased crying and say “I thought you weren’t
going to hit me any more”.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1046]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">A number of witnesses testified that on
previous occasions they had seen the appellant beating and slapping the
deceased. Anita McGraw, a week previous to the 5th of January, observed the
appellant slapping and punching the deceased in the face and head and banging
her head against the wall of their apartment.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Carl Taylor, who was somewhat intoxicated
on the night of January 4th, and somewhat confused as to times and the sequence
of events on that night, testified that the appellant and the deceased were in
his apartment No. 23 on the night of January 4 and that the appellant
continually beat the deceased, had thrown her on the floor and banged her head
three or four times against the refrigerator door. He also testified the
deceased had left the apartment to go to the toilet followed by the appellant. </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA"> said he followed them out into the
hall to see what was going on and saw the appellant helping the deceased up off
the floor of the landing of the stairway in front of the bathroom. A police
officer testified this landing was six and three quarters inches below the
level of the hall floor or one step down. All three then returned to </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s apartment. The appellant finally
returned to his own apartment about </span><span lang="EN-CA">7:30 a.m.</span><span lang="EN-CA">, dragging the deceased, who was at the time unconscious, by the

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on
October 6, 1977, and the following three questions were put to this Court by
the appellant as grounds of appeal:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. Did the Supreme Court of New Brunswick,
Court of Appeal err in law in holding that the learned Trial Court Judge did
not err in law in not holding a voir dire for various statements allegedly made
by the accused appellant, Hubert Edwin Morris?</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">2. Did the Supreme Court of New Brunswick,
Court of Appeal err in holding that the learned Trial Court Judge did not err
in law in not instructing the jury that the evidence of Karl Taylor, a Crown
witness, should be treated as that of an accomplice?</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">3. Did the Supreme Court of New Brunswick
Court of Appeal, err in law in finding that the lack of</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1047]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">knowledge, due to intoxication, that bodily
harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death is not a “defence” to a
charge of murder, and did they thereby err in not holding that the evidence of
drunkenness in this case was so overwhelming that it should have reduced the
verdict to manslaughter?</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I shall deal with those three grounds of appeal
in the same order.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This Court, on </span><span lang="EN-CA">December 21, 1978</span><span lang="EN-CA">, pronounced judgment in
the appeal of <i>Keith Bruce Erven v. Her Majesty The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a><i>. </i>In that appeal, reasons were
delivered by Dickson J. which were concurred in by three other members of the
Court. Concurring reasons were delivered by Pratte J. which were concurred in
by another member of the Court, and dissenting reasons were delivered by
Ritchie J., concurred in by two members of the Court. Dickson J., for himself
and for his three concurring brethren, expressed the view at p.&nbsp;943:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">In my opinion, it is always necessary to
hold a <i>voir dire </i>to determine the voluntariness of a statement made by
an accused out of court to a person in authority. Only in this way can fairness
to the accused be assured. To require a <i>voir dire </i>only if doubt is cast
on the voluntariness of a statement by the circumstances under which it was
made, as determined from evidence given in the trial proper, would not only
shift a burden to the accused but also, in other respects, cause him
significant prejudice. One must be realistic with the jury process. If the
statement is subsequently ruled inadmissible, the jury will, nevertheless, at
least be left with the knowledge that a statement was made by the accused which
has now been excluded. This is bound to arouse suspicion as to its content. If
evidence of the context of the statement is allowed to be given for some time
before anything casts doubt on its voluntariness, the jury will know something,
and perhaps much, of its content. Prejudice will surely result. Such a limited
requirement would destroy the fundamental distinction between the function of
the <i>voir dire</i>,<i> </i>which is to determine voluntariness, and that of
the trial proper, which is to determine guilt.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I can see no justification for engrafting
upon the general rule, which is remarkably free of qualifications, any
exception and, particularly, one expressed in such terms as “obviously
voluntary” or “volunteered”. Attempts in</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1048]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">the past to water down the rule have not
met with success and, in my opinion, the present attempt should also be
repelled.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">With that view, I then concurred, as did two of
my brethren, and I apply that view to the present appeal to say that the appellant’s
statements to the two police constables Arbour and Larder should not have been
admitted Unless and until their voluntary character had been determined in a <i>voir
dire.</i></span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Limerick J.A. suggested, as one of the reasons
for the admissibility of the statements, that these two officers, when they
entered the appellant’s apartment, were not “persons in authority”. The learned
justice in appeal was of the view that they were not then investigating a crime
and that there was no suggestion that a crime had been committed. I have read
and reread the evidence of the constables. They testified that they were on
patrol in a marked police cruiser at about 8:20 a.m. when they received a call
on the police radio. Constable Larder merely testified “We received a call from
our despatch”. Constable Arbour testified “I answered a call to Windsor Hotel
or Windsor Apartments”. When the two constables entered the apartment, they
found the victim lying across the bed unconscious, one thought at first that
she was dead, and the appellant and the witness Carl Taylor present. Arbour
asked who called the ambulance and also what was the trouble. With respect, I
have not the slightest doubt that both the appellant and Carl Taylor had no
other thought than that these two uniformed constables, appearing so
immediately after the call for the ambulance and finding these two men with an
unconscious woman, were “persons in authority” and were exercising their
authority in the investigation of highly suspicious circumstances. I can see
nothing in the circumstances which would permit a conclusion other than that it
was a situation which required that the admissibility of the statements should
be tested in a <i>voir dire. </i>I subscribe to what was said by Martin J.A. on
this point in <i>R. v. Sweezey</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[3]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>at
p.&nbsp;177:</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1049]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am consequently of the view that a
statement made by a person to a police officer conducting an investigation with
respect to a suspected offence must be shown to have been made voluntarily
before it is admissible against that person in a criminal trial in which he is
an accused. The words “statement by an accused” used by Lord Sumner in <i>Ibrahim
v. The King, supra, </i>in my view, refer to a statement made by a person who
is an accused in a criminal trial when the statement is sought to be introduced
against him rather than to the fact that he was an accused at the time he made
the statement.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Then, is the failure to hold a <i>voir dire, </i>and
the consequent submission to the jury of evidence which might have been
inadmissible as not voluntary, fatal to the conviction? Dickson J., in <i>Erven,
</i>was of the opinion that s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) was available but
that the circumstances in that case made its use inadvisable. Pratte J.
expressed the same view. Ritchie J., in his dissenting reasons, was of the
opinion that the statements were properly admitted without a <i>voir dire </i>but
concluded, “I am, therefore, in any event of the opinion that this is a case in
which s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>should be
invoked”.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I, therefore, turn to consider whether the
failure to hold a <i>voir dire </i>in the circumstances of this case resulted
in no substantial miscarriage of justice so as to permit the application of
s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The circumstances
are quite unusual. The appellant had been tried previously for the same offence
and was then represented by the same counsel who appeared on his behalf on the
second trial, in the Appeal Division and in this Court. At the first trial, the
admissibility of these statements was considered in a <i>voir dire. </i>After
conviction, a new trial was directed (<i>R. v. Morris</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[4]</span></span></span></a>).</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Upon Constables Larder and Arbour being called
at the second trial, this same counsel made no objection to the admissibility
of their evidence in which they testified as to the statements in question and
made no request that such issue be considered in a <i>voir dire. </i>These two
witnesses, and many others, were cross-examined minutely as to</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1050]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">the fact that they failed to observe obvious
signs of a beating when they first saw the victim. The statements objected to
as inadmissible were totally exculpatory. “She had been drinking all night and
she had fallen down the stairs on her way to the bathroom”, Arbour testified.
That factor, however, does not remove the necessity of a voir dire (<i>Piché v.
The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[5]</span></span></span></a>) but it
is of importance in considering whether s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) should be
applied. Of much more importance is that counsel for the defence called two
witnesses but did not call the appellant who, in conversation with another
patron of a tavern the next morning, had made admissions very contradictory to
his exculpatory statement the admissibility of which is here in question. In
his address to the jury, counsel for the appellant attacked very strongly the
reliability of the evidence of the Crown witness Carl Taylor which will be
dealt with hereafter and other witnesses who had testified to a series of
brutal assaults upon the victim by the appellant and then said:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">If you are not satisfied, if you are
satisfied that the injuries came about partly of her own volition, perhaps
because she fell down the stairs, which evidence I will deal with in a few
minutes, perhaps from a culmination of events over a period of time, which
again is not the subject matter of this charge, then you must find the accused
not guilty.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Counsel continued in his address to stress the
evidence as to the appellant’s intoxication in reference to his ability to
possess the necessary intent but then returned to an analysis of the evidence
of the other witnesses and of the medical evidence to show in it support for
the statement of the accused, recited above, the admissibility of which he now
contests even referring to the statement itself. Under these circumstances,
there is much force to the comment made by Limerick J.A. that “the admission of
the statement formed the basis for the defence that the beating inflicted on
the deceased by the appellant was not the cause of her death”.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1051]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am not ready to hold that counsel for the
accused waived the requirement of a <i>voir dire </i>or even that such a waiver
is possible. That matter is to be considered in another appeal. But these
facts, together with the presence of a mass of evidence, not only from Carl
Taylor but many other witnesses recounting the many assaults upon the deceased
during that long terrible night, convince me that the admissibility of this
very brief exculpatory statement without determining its voluntary character in
a <i>voir dire </i>caused no substantial miscarriage of justice. Therefore, I
would apply s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i></span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The second ground of appeal urged in this Court
was the submission that the learned trial judge should have included in his
charge to the jury a warning that Carl Taylor was an accomplice and that,
therefore, it was dangerous to convict on his uncorroborated evidence although
it was within their power to do so. Although Carl Taylor was arrested later in
the morning after the constables’ arrival at the scene and was taken to the
police station, Constable Larder testified that it was because he was
intoxicated not because he was considered to have been involved in the offence.
Of course, when Constables Arbour and Larder arrived at the Windsor Apartments
and entered the apartment in question, they found there the unconscious victim and
two men, the appellant and Carl Taylor. The constables’ investigation could not
fail to include them both and for the purpose of that investigation both would
be considered suspects. But after the evidence at the trial had been concluded
and the judge charged the jury, it was apparent that Carl Taylor could not be
considered an “accomplice” in the limited sense of the word. Despite the
appellant’s argument in this Court, I find no authority for the proposition
that one who merely fails to prevent another person assaulting a third can be
considered as an accomplice in the assault. I agree with Dickson J.A., as he
then was, when he said in <i>R. v. Taylor</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[6]</span></span></span></a><i>
</i>at p.&nbsp;329, “A person merely witnessing an act does not thereby become
an accomplice”. </span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1052]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Indeed counsel for the accused, in his address
to the jury, although he attacked most vigorously Carl Taylor’s credibility,
did not imply that </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA"> might
have taken any part in beating the victim. Carl Taylor, however, did make a
statement to these officers which tended to exonerate the appellant. Constable
Arbour, in his testimony, reported </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA"> as saying, after the appellant had stated that the victim had
fallen down the stairs, “Oh, she is alright, she’s just sleeping”. Carl Taylor,
in cross-examination, admitted that he told the officers that “nothing
happened”. Carl Taylor assigned two reasons for this false statement: firstly,
he feared that he himself might be accused of harming the girl and, secondly,
he feared that the appellant, who had threatened him with a knife only a few
days before, would harm him if he involved the appellant. In <i>The King v.
Levy</i><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[7]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>the
Court of Appeal held that a person who concealed evidence, knowing that an
accused was guilty, in an attempt to assist him in escaping conviction was an
accessory after the fact. The <i>Criminal Code </i>defines an accessory after
the fact in s.&nbsp;23(1) as follows:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">23. (1) An accessory after the fact to an
offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to the offence,
receives, comforts or assists him for the purpose of enabling him to escape.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am of the opinion that <i>The King v. Levy,
supra</i>,<i> </i>would have been so decided if that subsection&nbsp;of the <i>Code
</i>had been applicable and <i>R. v. Andrews, R. v. Craig</i><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[8]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>is to the same effect. I quote Lord
Parker, C.J., at p.&nbsp;962:</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">That he did not do so fully is clear, because a
full direction entails telling the jury that they must be satisfied that the
appellant did the acts complained of for the purpose of assisting the principal
felon to escape apprehension or conviction.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA">R. v. French</span></i><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[9]</span></span></span></span></a><i><span lang="EN-CA"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">is to the same effect.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1053]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I cannot see that the fact that Carl Taylor’s
action was motivated by fear of reprisal would make him any less an accessory
after the fact in the present circumstances. With respect, I must differ from
Limerick J.A. when he said:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">There is no evidence to support the
suggestion that </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA"> told the
police nothing happened with the intention of helping the appellant escape
liability.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am of the opinion that </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA"> so admitted in his
cross-examination.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The question, therefore, is whether it is
necessary to give to the jury the “accomplice warning” in the case of a witness
who was an accessory after the fact. The issue was referred to rather obliquely
in <i>Horsburgh v.</i> <i>The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[10]</span></span></span></a>,<i>
</i>where the Court was considering whether the trial judge should have warned
himself in accordance with the rule of practice, now become a rule of law,
applicable to the evidence of accomplices, upon considering the evidence of a
group of juvenile witnesses who had testified for the prosecution. It was the
contention of the Crown that these witnesses could not be considered
accomplices as they could not have been convicted of the charge against the
accused. Martland J., at p.&nbsp;755, cited and adopted the statement of Lord
Simonds, L.C., in <i>Davies. Director of Public Prosecutions</i><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[11]</span></span></span></a><i> </i>at p.&nbsp;400:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">There is in the authorities no formal
definition of the term “accomplice”: and your Lordships are forced to deduce a
meaning for the word from the cases in which X, Y and Z have been held to be,
or held liable to be treated as, accomplices. On the cases it would appear that
the following persons, if called as witnesses for the prosecution have been
treated as falling within the category:—</span></p>

<p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(1) On any view, persons who are participes
criminis in respect of the actual crime charged, whether as principals or
accessories before or after the fact (in felonies) or persons committing,
procuring or aiding and abetting (in the case of misdemeanors). This is surely
the natural and primary meaning of the term “accomplice”. But in two cases,
persons falling strictly outside the ambit of</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1054]</span></p>

<p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">this category have, in particular
decisions, been held to be accomplices for the purpose of the rule: viz:</span></p>

<p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) Receivers have been held to be
accomplices of the thieves from whom they receive goods on a trial of the
latter for larceny (<i>Rex v. Jennings</i>,<i> </i>(1912) 7&nbsp;Cr.&nbsp;App.&nbsp;R.
242: <i>R. v.</i> <i>Dixon</i>,<i> </i>(1925) 19 Cr. App. R. 36):</span></p>

<p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(3) When X has been charged with a specific
offence on a particular occasion, and evidence is admissible, and has been
admitted, of his having committed crimes of this identical type on other
occasions, as proving system and intent and negativing accident; in such cases
the court has held that in relation to such other similar offences, if evidence
of them were given by parties to them, the evidence of such other parties
should not be left to the jury without a warning that it is dangerous to accept
it without corroboration. (<i>Rex v. Farid</i>,<i> </i>(1945) 30 Cr. App. R.
168).</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Martland J. continued at p.&nbsp;756:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I do not agree that this result follows
from the <i>Davies </i>case. Particeps criminis means one who shares or
co-operates in a criminal offence. The passage cited from that case shows that
the term includes an accessory after the fact, who certainly could not be
convicted of the main offence. What is necessary to become an accomplice is a
participation in the crime involved, and not necessarily the actual commission
of it. Whether or not there has been such participation will depend upon the
facts of the particular case.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It will be seen that Martland J. was there
concerned with whether a person was “participes criminis” even if he could not
be convicted of the offence of which the accused were charged. He illustrated
that the definition of “accomplice” was not so narrowly confined by pointing
out that the Lord Chancellor considered that even accessories after the fact
were “participes criminis” although certainly accessories after the fact, or
the witnesses in <i>Horsburgh </i>could be so convicted. As a matter of fact,
the witnesses in <i>Horsburgh </i>were certainly not in the position of
accessories after the fact. Martland J., for the majority, was of the opinion
they were accomplices in that they were “particeps criminis”.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1055]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>R. v. Gratton</i><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick determined that an accessory after the
fact was not an accomplice. Limerick J.A. there found that the inclusion of

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In Ontario in <i>R. v. Riezebos</i><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

cited <i>Mahlikilili Dhalamini v. The King</i><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[14]</span></span></span></a>,

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">With great respect, we are unable to agree
with this submission or with the conclusion of the Court in <i>R. v. Gratton,
supra, </i>and the other cases referred to. Logically, the evidence of an
accessory after the fact should be regarded as untrustworthy because of his
desire “to purchase lenient treatment for himself at the expense of the accused
by co-operating with the authorities” per Ritchie J., in <i>Horsburgh, supra, </i>at
p.&nbsp;310 C.C.C., p.&nbsp;719 D.L.R. It seems to us that the question whether
an accessory after the fact should be treated as an accomplice has been
answered affirmatively by the highest Court in the land in the <i>Horsburgh </i>case,
<i>supra, </i>so that it is concluded and may be regarded as settled law in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA">.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The same issue came before this Court in <i>Paradis

Pigeon J., giving reasons for judgment for himself and two others, held that
although the warning need not be given in the case of an accessory after the

to have been determined by the jury to be an accomplice before he could have
been found to be an accessory after the fact and, therefore, the trial judge
was correct in including the warning in his charge. Martland J., for the
majority, at p.</span></p>

to the decision of the Court of Appeal of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Quebec</span><span lang="EN-CA"> that the warning need not be given in the case of an accessory
after the fact:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am not, however, prepared to accept the
view expressed by the Court of Appeal on that issue. The Court approved the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for </span><span lang="EN-CA">New Brunswick</span><span lang="EN-CA"> in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Gratton </i>(1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 150. In the
later case of <i>R. v.</i> <i>Riezebos </i>(1975), 26&nbsp;C.C.C. (2d) 1, the
Court of Appeal for Ontario did not agree with the conclusion reached in the <i>Gratton
</i>case, and preferred to adopt the definition of the term “accomplice” stated
by Lord Simonds, L.C., in <i>Davies v. Director of Public Prosecutions, </i>[1954]
A.C. 378, at p.&nbsp;400, which was accepted by my brother Ritchie and by me in
<i>Horsburgh v.</i> <i>The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1967] S.C.R. 746, at pp. 768 and
756. I am not persuaded that we were wrong in so doing.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In that paragraph, Martland J., for the majority
of the Court, reaffirmed the view which he had expressed in <i>Horsburgh, </i>again
for the majority, that an accessory after the fact was “particeps criminis” and
so an accomplice and therefore that the warning should be given as to the
testimony of such a witness.</span></p>

of Appeal for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Ontario</span><span lang="EN-CA"> was
concerned with the testimony of a witness who had first stated to police that

had so stated for fear of her life. The Court held, in a unanimous judgment,
that the trial judge was in error in not leaving to the jury the question of
whether the witness were an accessory after the fact if she had so acted for
the purpose of enabling the accused to escape. MacKinnon J.A., as he then was,

passage from the majority judgment in <i>Horsburgh v. The Queen, </i>[1968] 2&nbsp;C.C.C.
288 at pp. 298-9, 63 D.L.R. (2d) 699, [1967] S.C.R. 746 at p.&nbsp;756 [p. 10]:</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1057]</span></p>

<p class="Citation2"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Particeps criminis </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">means one who shares or co-operates in a criminal offence. The
passage cited from that case shows that the <i>term includes an accessory after
the fact, </i>who certainly could not be convicted of the main offence. What is
necessary to become an accomplice is a participation in the crime involved, and
not necessarily the actual commission of it. Whether or not there has been such
participation will depend upon the facts of the particular case.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The Court in <i>Riezebos </i>came to the
conclusion that the question whether an accessory after the fact should be
treated as an accomplice had been answered affirmatively by the Supreme Court
of Canada in the <i>Hors-burgh </i>case. The majority of the Supreme Court
reaffirmed this view in <i>Paradis v. The Queen </i>(1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 387,
73&nbsp;D.L.R. (3d) 745, 13 N.R. 251.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Despite the clash of opinion between the appeal
courts in New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario, I have come to the conclusion that
MacKinnon J.A., as he then was, was correct when he stated that the majority of
this Court had, in <i>Paradis, </i>reaffirmed that the trial judge should give
to the jury the accomplice warning as to witnesses whom they find to be
accessories after the fact. I realize the <i>obiter </i>character of statements
to this effect in both <i>Horsburgh </i>and <i>Paradis </i>but it is an <i>obiter
</i>which has been repeated and, at least in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Ontario</span><span lang="EN-CA">, has been adopted as a firm statement of the law. The rule, in my
opinion, is a salutary one for the reason referred to in <i>Horsburgh </i>by
Ritchie J. and stated again by Lacourciere J.A. in <i>Riezebos </i>at
p.&nbsp;11:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Logically, the evidence of an accessory
after the fact should be regarded as untrustworthy because of his desire “to
purchase lenient treatment for himself at the expense of the accused by
co-operating with the authorities”.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I have, therefore, concluded as part of my <i>ratio
decidendi </i>in this appeal that the learned trial judge erred in not leaving
to the jury the question of whether Carl Taylor was an accessory after the fact
and warning them that if they so found it would be dangerous to convict the
appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of such accessory after the fact.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1058]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Again, this does not end the matter. There is no
logical reason why it should be determined that the provisions of
s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) should not be invoked. Limerick J.A. did so in
his reasons for the Appeal Division applying the section&nbsp;without expressly
referring to it, in the last paragraph of his reasons. MacKinnon J.A., as he
then was, adopted the same course in <i>French </i>when he said at p.&nbsp;216:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The jury were left in no doubt as to the
danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of Miss Deveau. The warning
given by the trial Judge satisfied the requirements of justice and there was no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in his failing to leave to the jury
the question of whether Miss Deveau was an accessory after the fact.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I therefore turn to consider whether the failure
I have found in the charge resulted in any miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Carl Taylor was amply demonstrated to be the
most unreliable witness. There is some significance in the fact that the
witness upon whom the Crown relied to testify to the cruel and senseless
beating inflicted upon the deceased over many hours was only called as the
twenty-seventh witness for the Crown after two hundred and fifty-three foolscap
pages of evidence had been given. In his examination it was shown that Carl
Taylor came directly from an alcoholics’ rehabilitation institution accompanied
by an attendant and that he had a criminal record. The cross-examination
reveals page after page of contradictions, hesitations and frequent resort to
the reply of “I don’t remember”, which might well reflect his own intoxication
during the critical period. All of these features of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s testimony were the subject of very strong comments in the defence
counsel’s address to the jury.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Although as the learned trial judge asks in his
charge “Did the blows described by </span><u><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span></u><u><span lang="EN-CA"> and that is the only evidence of the serious blows</span></u><span lang="EN-CA">, cause a rupture of the sagittal vein…?” (the underlining is my
own), there was a great deal of other direct and circumstantial evidence of
well nigh continuous beating of the deceased by the accused</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1059]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">during this long and terrible night. Moreover,
evidence was given by one witness that the accused in the tavern the next
morning admitted “I beat her up and I don’t know whether she’s alive or dead”.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">These matters were all before the jury on the
evidence which they heard. But the importance of the rule requiring the judge
to give the accomplice warning is just that it comes <i>from the judge. </i>So
in <i>French, supra</i>,<i> </i>MacKinnon J.A., as he then was, sought
something in the trial judge’s charge which could compensate for the absence of
the necessary formal warning as to the evidence of an accomplice, having
included an accessory after the fact in that classification. He quoted the
trial judge as follows at pp. 211-212:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown’s case rests on the foundation
provided by Nadine Deveau’s evidence. She is a self-confessed persistent liar,
thief and drug addict, who originally gave the police an alibi for Tom French,
and only many months later, in suspicious circumstances, accused Tom French.
Because of her character and her propensity to lie, and because of her
involvement in crime, it would be dangerous to convict on her evidence. No one
who knows her would believe her under oath, and in any event, look to the
evidence as regards the story of the original plot to murder Ken Landers; she
is supported by no one, and contradicted by Mrs.&nbsp;Landers.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">As regards the meeting outside the City
Hotel, she is supported by no one and contradicted by two guards,
Mr.&nbsp;Eriksen and Mr.&nbsp;Holbrook and by Bill Buck and Brian Holtzhauer.
As regards the conversation over at Adam Hanson’s barber shop, she is supported
by no one and contradicted by Don Morrison.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">There are a number of witnesses that you
have heard testify that they would not believe Nadine Deveau under oath, and I
should tell you that in the last resort it is for you to decide whether you
would believe Nadine Deveau under oath. These witnesses knew her, they say they
knew her and knew her reputation, and they said that they would not believe her
under oath. You have to judge their credibility.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-CA">…</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The fact is, members of the Jury, she is,
as I have said the most crucial witness in this case; and even if she were an
independent person, I would direct you in strong terms that you must scrutinize
her evidence most care-</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1060]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">fully, but because she is a person with a
criminal record and of ill repute, admittedly ill repute, then you should be
even more careful in weighing her evidence which is uncorroborated or
unsupported so far as the statements to her are concerned.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">and concluded, as I have already quoted, that
the jury was left in no doubt. However, in the present case when one turns to
the trial judge’s charge, there is no such emphasis on the frailties of Carl
Taylor’s evidence. </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s
intoxication is referred to; it is said that he was “trying to help himself”
but that is in reference to his submission to treatment for alcoholism not to
his possible seeking of leniency from the authorities. Once the learned trial
judge used the expression “Carl Taylor goes out if you believe him”, I am of
the opinion that these slight references to the character of the testimony
given by Carl Taylor can afford no justification for the application of
s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Code. </i>I cannot say that a jury
properly charged, and particularly that a jury given the required accomplice
warning as to the evidence of Carl Taylor, could not, acting judicially, have
failed to convict the appellant. This is especially true in light of the
matters to which I shall refer hereafter. Therefore, I cannot find the
certainty of no miscarriage of justice which would permit the application of
s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Code. </i>Upon this ground, the appeal
must be allowed and a new trial directed.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The third ground of appeal argued in this Court
as I have set out above deals with the defence of intoxication in reference to
the ability of the accused to form the required specific intent to commit the
crime of murder. In view of the direction for a new trial which I believe is
necessary as a result of the second ground of appeal, it is not necessary to
deal with the third ground. However, I am of the opinion that the issue should
be clarified so that the trial judge upon the new trial may properly instruct
the jury. Further, with respect, I am of the opinion that the decisions of the
Judicial Committee and of this Court do not</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1061]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">support the views expressed in his reasons of
Limerick J.A., who said:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Ground (e). There was evidence upon which
the jury could find as they did and as they are the exclusive judges of the facts
this Court, in the absence of error in law on the part of the trial Judge,
cannot interfere with the finding of the jury. Lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that the bodily harm inflicted was likely to cause death is not a
defence to a charge of murder. A person cannot escape liability by pleading he
voluntarily consumed so much alcohol that he was unable to appreciate the
probable consequents of his actions. See the judgment of Lord Denning in
Attorney-General for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Northern Ireland</span><span lang="EN-CA"> v. Gallagher [1963] A.C. 349 at p.&nbsp;380 approved by the Supreme
Court of Canada in Perrault v. R. [1971] S.C.R. 196 at p.&nbsp;203.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-CA">…</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The trial judge adequately and properly
instructed the jury as to the effect of drunkenness in relation to the charge
of murder and the facts of the case and, indeed, he instructed the jury that he
very much doubted if the appellant was able to form the necessary intent to
commit the crime of murder on account of his intoxicated condition. There was,
however, evidence including that of expert witnesses which, if believed, on
which the jury could find the appellant had the ability to form the intent to
inflict bodily harm which he should have known was likely to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not, and this court cannot substitute its
opinion for that of the jury on this question of fact.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is true that in Attorney General for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Northern Ireland</span><span lang="EN-CA"> v. Gallagher<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[16]</span></span></span></a>, Lord Denning said at p.&nbsp;380:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(a) It may impair a man’s powers of
perception so that he may not be able to foresee or measure the consequences of
his actions as he would if he were sober. Nevertheless he is not allowed to set
up his self-induced want of perception as a defence. Even if he did not himself
appreciate that what he was doing was dangerous, nevertheless if a reasonable
man in his place who was not befuddled with drink would have appreciated it, he
is guilty: see <i>Rex v. Meade</i>,<i> </i>[1909] 1 K.B. 895; 25 T.L.R. 359; 2
Cr. App. R. 54, C.C.A., as explained in</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1062]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">, [1920] A.C. 479, 502-504.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">But at p.&nbsp;381, Lord Denning continued:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The general principle which I have
enunciated is subject to two exceptions:</span></p>

<p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">1. If a man is charged with an offence in
which a specific intention is essential (as&nbsp;in murder, though not in
manslaughter), then evidence of drunkenness, which renders him incapable of
forming that intention, is an answer: see <i>Beard’s </i>case, [1920] A.C. 479,
501, 504. This degree of drunkenness is reached when the man is rendered so
stupid by drink that he does not know what he is doing (see <i>Reg. v. Moore </i>(1852),
3 Car. &amp; Kir. 319), as where, at a christening, a drunken nurse put the
baby behind a large fire, taking it for a log of wood (Gentleman’s Magazine,
1748, p.&nbsp;570); and where a drunken man thought his friend (lying in his bed)
was a theatrical dummy placed there and stabbed him to death (“The Times”,
January 13, 1951). In each of those cases it would not be murder. But it would
be manslaughter.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">And when Fauteux C.J.C. cited this decision with
approval in <i>Perrault v. The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[17]</span></span></span></a>,<i>
</i>at p.&nbsp;203, he continued with the words:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Lord Denning then indicated that the
general principle of English law as to drunkenness, illustrated as above in (<i>a</i>),
(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>and (<i>c</i>), is subject to two exceptions which, in my
opinion, in view of the finding of facts in this case, have no application in
this instance.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Therefore, I am of the opinion that the jury
must determine whether the accused was so affected by intoxication as to
“render him incapable of forming that intention”: <i>Attorney General v.
Gallagher, supra. </i>If the jury has any reasonable doubt that the Crown has
failed to prove that the accused, despite his intoxication, had the ability to
form such a specific intent they must acquit him of murder, though they should
convict him of manslaughter. A careful reading of the learned trial judge’s
charge convinces me that it was quite accurate in this respect. I, therefore,
do not criticize the charge but only the inferences which may be drawn from
Limerick J.A.’s statements in respect to the defence of intoxication. The
appel-</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1063]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">lant’s third ground of complaint does not refer
to the charge but to the duty of a court of appeal under s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>a</i>)(i)
of the <i>Criminal Code </i>which provides:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal</span></p>

<p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>may allow the appeal
where it is of the opinion that</span></p>

<p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I have quoted above Limerick J.A.’s disposition
of the question. In my respectful opinion, it is not sufficient to say:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">There was evidence upon which the jury
could find as they did and as they are the exclusive judges of the facts, this
Court, in the absence of error in law on the part of the trial Judge, cannot
interfere with the finding of the jury.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The task of the Appellate Court was outlined by
Pigeon J. giving the majority judgment in <i>Corbett v. The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[18]</span></span></span></a><i> </i>when he said at pp. 278-9:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Of course, if the judges of the majority
had held that their function was only to decide whether there was evidence,
this would be reversible error. The Code expressly provides that the appeal may
be allowed, not only when the verdict cannot be supported by the evidence but
also when it is unreasonable. In other words, the Court of Appeal must satisfy
itself not only that there was evidence requiring the case to be submitted to
the jury, but also that the weight of such evidence is not so weak that a
verdict of guilty is unreasonable. This cannot be taken to mean that the Court
of Appeal is to substitute its opinion for that of the jury. The word of the
enactment is “unreasonable” not “unjustified”. The jurors are the triers of the
facts and their finding is not to be set aside because the judges in appeal do
not think they would have made the same finding if sitting as jurors. This is
only to be done if they come to the conclusion that the verdict is such that no
twelve reasonable men could possibly have reached it acting judicially.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1064]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As Limerick J.A. pointed out, the learned trial
judge was highly doubtful that the jury could find that the appellant could
have formed the necessary specific intent. Therefore, as Pigeon J. said, the
Appeal Division must satisfy itself not that there was evidence but that the
weight of such evidence was not so weak as to make the verdict of the jury
unreasonable. This requirement certainly does not go to the extent of requiring
the Appeal Division to substitute its opinion for that of the jury but it does
call upon the Appeal Division to determine whether any twelve reasonable men
could possibly have reached that verdict. In view of all the evidence as to
gross intoxication of the appellant and the very evident doubt expressed by the
learned trial judge as to the appellant’s ability to form the necessary intent,
the prosecuting authorities might well consider whether the new trial which is
directed in these reasons might not be upon the charge of manslaughter.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">For the reasons set out above, I would allow the
appeal and direct a new trial.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Province of </span><span lang="EN-CA">New Brunswick</span><span lang="EN-CA"> affirming the conviction of the appellant at his trial for murder
punishable by life imprisonment before Barr J. sitting with a jury.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I think it desirable to observe at the outset
that this appeal is concerned with the second trial of the appellant on the
same charge, his conviction at an earlier trial having been set aside and a new
trial directed by the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, for the reasons which are
now reported in (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) at p.&nbsp;540.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The following grounds of appeal are now raised
by the Notice of Appeal to this Court:</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">That the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding
that the learned trial court judge did not err in law</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1065]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">1. In not holding a <i>voir dire </i>for various
statements allegedly made by the accused appellant;</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">2. In not instructing the jury that the evidence
of Carl Taylor a Crown witness should be treated as the evidence of an
accomplice;</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">3. In finding that lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death
is not a “defence” to a charge of murder, and therefore erred in not holding
that the evidence of drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict
to manslaughter.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I have had the benefit of reading the reasons
for judgment prepared for delivery by my brother Spence who deals exhaustively
with these three grounds of appeal and after a comprehensive review of the fact
concludes that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial should be granted
on both the second and third grounds. Although I find myself in disagreement
with my brother Spence in the result, I am nevertheless satisfied that he has
accurately summarized the relevant evidence, which was also reviewed by
Limerick J.A. in the Court of Appeal whose reasons for judgment are now
conveniently reported in (1977), 18 N.B.R. (2d) at p.&nbsp;523 <i>et seq.</i></span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There can be little doubt that the deceased came
to her death as a result of a vicious beating administered by the appellant
during the night and early morning of January 4 and 5, 1974, and the appellant
is in fact reported to have made the observation in a tavern at noon on the 5th
that: “I beat her up; I don’t know if she is alive or dead.”</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The first ground of error alleged by the
appellant has to do with statements made by him in the presence of two police
officers who came to the hotel or rooming house where he resided with the
deceased. The officers had been alerted by a radio call from their headquarters
which had in turn been occasioned by the fact that one Carl Taylor, who lives
in the house and had been with the appellant while the brutal beating was being
administered to the deceased, had telephoned to the hospital because of the
girl’s condition.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1066]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">When the two police constables arrived at the
rooming house they were directed to the appellant’s bedroom (No. 25), and upon
entering they found the appellant standing by the bed on which the victim was
lying in an unconscious condition, with Carl Taylor sitting beside her.
Constable Arbour described the condition of the victim at this time in the
following passage:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Would you describe her, please, as you
saw her?</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. She was lying crossways on the bed, her
feet dangling to the floor, but they weren’t touching the floor. She was
unconscious. Her eyes were half shut, she was breathing heavily, and it
appeared that she was snoring. She made snoring sounds. She was dressed in a
sweater and slacks. Mr.&nbsp;Carl Taylor, who testified earlier, he was sitting
on the bed on Miss Hitchcock’s righthand side, and Mr.&nbsp;Morris would be on
her lefthand side near the bed standing up beside her. When I entered the room,
I asked who had called the ambulance. Mr.&nbsp;Morris replied, ‘I did’, and I
then asked what the problem was, and Mr.&nbsp;Morris replied she had been
drinking all night and she had fallen down the stairs on her way to the
bathroom. At this time, Mr.&nbsp;Taylor spoke up and said, ‘Oh, she’s all
right, she’s just sleeping’. I then asked who she was, and Mr.&nbsp;Morris
replied, ‘My wife’, and I asked another question, when she had fallen down the
stairs. Again Mr.&nbsp;Morris replied, ‘About an hour ago’.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I agree with my brother Spence that in the
particular circumstances of this case, the learned trial judge was in error in
admitting the statements made by the appellant on this occasion without the
holding of a <i>voir dire. </i>The police officers were in uniform and the
girl’s condition must have made it obvious that they were investigating a
serious case of assault to say the least. I am, however, also in agreement with
my brother Spence for the reasons which he has stated, that the conduct of the
proceedings by appellant’s counsel who made no objection to the introduction of
this evidence notwithstanding the fact that a <i>voir dire </i>had been held in
respect to it at the first trial, when taken in conjunction with the mass of
evidence from the various occupants of the rooming house where the assault took
place, made the error in admitting in evidence the brief exculpatory statement
made by</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1067]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">the appellant to the police one which occasioned
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and that this is an appropriate
area in which to invoke the provisions of s.&nbsp;613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Criminal
Code.</i></span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The second ground of appeal is directed to the
question of whether or not the evidence justified the conclusion that Carl
Taylor was an accomplice and whether the learned trial judge erred in failing
to give the appropriate warning to the jury that it would be dangerous to
convict on his uncorroborated evidence.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The role played by Taylor in relation to the
sordid events of the night and early morning during which the beatings were
administered to the deceased can be summarized as follows: Taylor spent the
earlier part of the evening drinking with the appellant and after the rough
treatment of the girl at the hands of the appellant had started, she was
brought by the appellant to Taylor’s room where further assaults of a violent
and vicious character took place. It was not until the early morning of the 5th
that the appellant dragged the now unconscious girl by her hair from </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s apartment to his own. These were
the circumstances under which </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA"> made his call to the hospital which ultimately resulted in the
arrival of the police.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the fact of his having been present during the terrible events of the night and
morning in question, and having taken no steps of any kind to stop the
appellant in his actions, was enough of itself to brand Taylor as an
accomplice, but I agree with my brother Spence that a person does not become an
accomplice merely by witnessing an act and taking no steps to prevent it and
that the evidence did not justify a finding that Taylor was an accomplice in
the sense of participating in the crime.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is, however, contended that two statements
made by Taylor to the police tended to exonerate the appellant and that in this
sense he was an accessory after the fact, and the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that his evidence, like that of an accomplice, was such as
to make it dangerous to act upon it without corroboration.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1068]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In this latter regard, the only evidence relied
on as constituting Taylor an accessory after the fact is the following: (i) the
statement to the police to which I have referred when he said “Oh, she’s all
right, she’s just sleeping” and (ii) the admission made on cross-examination
that he had told the police officers that “nothing happened”. The context in
which the last mentioned statement was allegedly made when the police officers
first arrived and </span><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s
alleged admission, occurs in the following passage of his cross-examination:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Now, what did you tell the police
happened?</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. I told them nothing happened.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. You told them nothing happened. You told
them nothing happened.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. I was so damn scared I did not know what
to say.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Taylor</span><span lang="EN-CA">’s explanation of
both statements is that he was frightened of the police on his own account
because the beatings had taken place in his room, and he feared also that the
appellant might do him violence as he had threatened to do in the past. It is
significant also that he described his condition at the time that he was
talking to the police as “I was in bad shape; I was shook up; I had been
drinking—”. These latter statements are certainly supported by the evidence.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The history of the development of the concept of
“an accessory after the fact” is well described in Crankshaw’s Criminal Code of
Canada, Seventh Edition, at p.&nbsp;65:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The third and most important condition is
that a person in order to be an accessory after the fact must be shewn to have
done some act to assist the principal offender personally: <i>R. v. Chapple, </i>9
C. &amp; P. 355; either to conceal the crime or to evade the pursuit of
justice; so that where, for instance, a person is charged with being an
accessory after the fact to murder, the question for the jury is whether such
person knowing the murder to have been committed was either assisting the
murderer to conceal the death or in any way enabling him to escape being
brought to justice: <i>R. v.</i> <i>Greenacre, </i>8 C. &amp; P. 35. See also <i>R.
v.</i> <i>Hansill, </i>3 Cox C.C. 397.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Acts intended to destroy or conceal things
which may be produced in evidence against a prisoner on his trial make the doer
of such acts an accessory after the fact: <i>R. v.</i> <i>Levy</i>,<i> </i>7
Cr. App. Rep. 61, 28 T.L.R. 93.</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1069]</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">One does not become an accessory after the
fact by merely neglecting to inform the authorities that a crime has been
committed or by forbearing to arrest the offender: 1&nbsp;Hale 618, 619.</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The test of an accessory after the fact
seems to be that he renders, to one known by him to have committed a criminal
offence, some active personal help to enable him to conceal his offence or
hinder his apprehension, trial or punishment, as by concealing him in the house
or shutting the door against his pursuers until he should have an opportunity
to escape, or by furnishing him with money or food to support him in hiding, or
by supplying him with a horse to enable him to fly from his pursuers, or a house
or other shelter to conceal him in, or by using open force or violence to
protect him, or by taking money from him to allow him to escape, or by bribing
his gaoler to let him escape, or by conveying instruments to the principal
offender to enable him to break goal.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the present circumstances it appears to me to
be relevant to refer to the reasons for judgment of Lord Denning in <i>Sykes v.</i>
<i>The Director of Public Prosecutions</i><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[19]</span></span></span></a><i>
</i>at p.&nbsp;561 where he said, in part:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">…if the acts of assistance were done, not
to hinder the arrest of the felon, but with another motive, such as to avoid
arrest himself (see <i>R. v.</i> <i>Jones</i>,<i> </i>[1948] 2 All E.R. 964),
or to make money for himself without regard to what happened to the felon (as
in the present case), he would not be guilty as an accessory after the fact.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In any event, the role of an accessory after the
fact is clearly defined in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> by s.&nbsp;23(1) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>which reads:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">23. (1) An accessory after the fact to an
offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to the offence
receives, comforts or assists him for the purpose of enabling him to escape.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The two statements above referred to which are
relied on as evidence that Taylor was an accessory after the fact, must be read
in light of this definition.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">At the time when the first statement was made,
according to the police officer, the victim was</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1070]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">unconscious—“Her eyes were half shut, she was
breathing heavily, and it appeared that she was snoring”. With all respect to
those who hold a different view, I can find no basis for construing Taylor’s
statement “Oh, she’s all right, she’s just sleeping” given under these
circumstances as justifying the inference that he was an accessory after the
fact as above defined, nor do I find it possible to read his admission that he
told the police “nothing happened” as referable to anything done or said by him
“for the purpose of enabling” the appellant’s escape. I am therefore of opinion
that the trial judge did not err in failing to instruct the jury that the evidence
of Carl Taylor should be treated as evidence of an accessory after the fact,
and accordingly, no question arises in this case as to the necessity of warning
the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It will accordingly be apparent that I am in
agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Justice Limerick in the Court of Appeal that there is
no evidence that the statements hereinbefore quoted were made by Taylor in
receiving, comforting or assisting the appellant “for the purpose of enabling”
him to escape.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, the appellant alleges that the Court of
Appeal erred in law “in finding that lack of knowledge, due to intoxication,
that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death is not a
defence to a charge of murder, and therefore erred in not holding that the
evidence of drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict to
manslaughter”. In this regard, I agree with my brother Spence, for the reasons
which he has stated, that Mr.&nbsp;Justice Limerick, speaking on behalf of the
Court of Appeal, was in error when he said: “…lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death
is not a defence to a charge of murder”. In so stating the law,
Mr.&nbsp;Justice Limerick purported to be following the judgment of Lord
Denning in <i>Attorney General for Northern Ireland v. Gallagher</i><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[20]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>but in so doing he appears to have
overlooked what Lord Denning said at p.&nbsp;381 with respect to offences in
which a specific intention is</span></p>

<p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1071]</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">essential. His Lordship there said, in part:</span></p>

<p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. If a man is charged with an offence in
which a specific intention is essential (as in murder, though not in
manslaughter), then evidence of drunkenness, which renders him incapable of
forming that intention, is an answer: see <i>Beard’s </i>case, [1920] A.C. 479
at 501 &amp; 504. This degree of drunkenness is reached when the man is
rendered so stupid by drink that he does not know what he is doing.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">While acknowledging the error in
Mr.&nbsp;Justice Limerick’s reasons for judgment, I see no justification for
the further allegation that he erred in not holding that the evidence of
drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict to manslaughter.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the present case, Mr.&nbsp;Justice Spence has
made an express finding, with which I agree, that the trial judge correctly
instructed the jury in relation to the possible defence of drunkenness, and it
is the error which he found in the judgment of Mr.&nbsp;Justice Limerick that
appears to have evoked his suggestion that if a new trial is directed the
prosecuting authorities might well consider whether such new trial might be
upon the charge of manslaughter. In my view, however, no error made by the
Court of Appeal can alter the fact that a properly instructed jury, having
heard and seen the witnesses, brought in a verdict of guilty of murder. Here
there was no error in the charge of the learned trial judge and no errors made
in the Court of Appeal can affect the validity of the verdict rendered in
accordance with that charge.</span></p>

<p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">For all these reasons, I would dismiss this
appeal.</span></p>
