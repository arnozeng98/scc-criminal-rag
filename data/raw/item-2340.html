 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Thus, a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed, or that a more thorough investigation might produce evidence that could form the basis of a criminal charge, may exercise his or her discretion to decide not to engage the judicial process.&nbsp; But this discretion is not absolute.&nbsp; Far from having <i>carte blanche</i>, police&nbsp;officers must justify their decisions rationally.</p>

May</i> (1984), 13&nbsp;C.C.C.&nbsp;(3d)&nbsp;257&nbsp;(Ont.&nbsp;C.A.), <i>per</i> Martin&nbsp;J.A.; see also <i>R. v. Hearn</i> (1989), 48&nbsp;C.C.C.&nbsp;(3d)&nbsp;376&nbsp;(Nfld.

Charbonneau </i>(1992),&nbsp;13&nbsp;C.R.&nbsp;(4th)&nbsp;191&nbsp;(Que.&nbsp;C.A.)).&nbsp; The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did in fact intend to act in a way tending to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.&nbsp; A simple error of judgment will not be enough.&nbsp; An accused who acted in good faith, but whose conduct cannot be characterized as a legitimate exercise of the discretion, has not committed the criminal offence of obstructing justice.</p>

C.A.), at para.&nbsp;30, “[a]n acquittal is the appropriate order because it would be unfair to order a new trial and give the Crown a second opportunity to present a case on which a reasonable trier of fact could convict.”&nbsp; However, where the verdict is found to be unreasonable on the basis of inconsistency of verdicts, but the evidence against the appellant supported the conviction, the appropriate remedy will usually be a new trial.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Interested members of the public can satisfy themselves that justice has been done, or not, as the case may be.&nbsp; [para. 24]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">As a practical matter, these functional concerns are equally applicable to an appellate court’s consideration of an appeal based on the allegations of unreasonable verdict or a verdict that cannot be supported by the evidence.&nbsp; In the eyes of the litigants and the public, where the findings of facts essential to the verdict are “demonstrably incompatible” with evidence that is neither contradicted by other evidence nor rejected by the trial judge, such a verdict would lack legitimacy and would properly, I think, be treated as “unreasonable”.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">[<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] The Court has taken into consideration the writing of the incident report and the memorandum prepared by the accused and stapled to the report, which was left in Rocheleau’s pigeonhole.&nbsp; The only purpose of these documents was to divert attention from the events that had occurred during the night.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;

As Chamberland J.A. stated:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">[<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] The fact that the word “depression” does not appear in the incident report is not, in my opinion, determinative, or at any rate it is not sufficient to support a finding that the appellant’s explanations are unreliable or do not, at the very least, raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; I refuse to believe that the guilt or innocence of an accused can depend on whether or not a given word appears in a report.&nbsp; The purpose of the document is to report on an incident and the ensuing police action; it is not not a medical report, even though the words used describe what some would naturally associate with a depressive state:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
