 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">A review of the trial judge’s charge demonstrates that any errors in the charge on the issue of self‑defence caused minimal prejudice. <span lang="EN-GB">The trial judge’s reference to “a reasonable person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the accused’s situation” was not so incomplete as to create a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Taken as a whole, the charge could not have given the jury the impression that they were to consider the reasonableness of the accused’s perceptions from the perspective of the hypothetically neutral reasonable man, divorced from the accused’s personal circumstances.</span>&nbsp; The trial judge related the history of violence and fear that the accused suffered at the hands of the victim to the reasonable person.&nbsp; He then clearly directed the jury to consider, “in light of all that”, the reasonableness of the accused’s perception and whether an ordinary person, in the same circumstances, would have had the same perception.&nbsp; This is a proper approach to the application of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec34subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;34(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;The errors in the trial judge’s summary and handling of the expert’s&nbsp; testimony also caused minimal prejudice. A review of the charge as a whole indicates that the trial judge directed the jury to consider the climate of fear described by the expert in their deliberations and repeated on numerous occasions his evidence that the accused was in a state of anxiety at the time of the shooting. By pointing to the expert’s evidence, the trial judge ensured that his testimony would be considered during the discussion of each of the elements of self‑defence. </span>&nbsp;While the trial judge could have expressed himself more clearly in connecting the expert’s evidence to the elements of self‑defence, there is no requirement that the jury be perfectly instructed. Further, the trial judge’s insistence on what the expert did not consider did not cause serious prejudice to the accused. A judge must warn the jury that the more the expert relies on facts not proved in evidence, the less weight the jury may attribute to the opinion.&nbsp; The corollary is also true: the more the expert fails to consider relevant facts, the less weight the jury may attribute to the opinion.<span lang="EN-GB"> Lastly, although it would have been preferable for the trial judge to expand his comments on the details of the expert’s testimony, his failure to do so, in light of the whole charge and the overwhelming evidence, did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; The accused’s contention that where the defence is difficult there is no room for error on the part of the judge is rejected.&nbsp; The curative proviso is applicable if, as here, the standard is met.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The verdict would have been the same if the trial judge had properly directed the jury that the accused’s character evidence was relevant in assessing whether he could have committed murder.&nbsp; He only mentioned this once and thereafter restricted his comments to the relation between the evidence and the credibility of the accused.&nbsp; This error is of minor significance in the context of the charge as a whole and consequently caused little prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; The focus here is on the reasonableness of the accused’s perception that an attack was imminent and on his perception that there was no reasonable alternative when he approached his sleeping victim and shot him in the back of the head at close range.&nbsp; The evidence of good character sheds little light on this question.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">With respect to the accused’s refusal to give a blood sample, even if this refusal had some effect on the accused’s credibility, the effect was greatly diminished by the trial judge’s direction that no adverse inference could be drawn from the refusal.&nbsp; In light of the trial judge’s warning, the prejudice suffered by the accused was minimal.&nbsp; When considered in the context of the defence as a whole, this issue was so removed from the heart of the case that it had very little significance. </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Finally, since&nbsp; the Crown&nbsp; had the right to counter the expert evidence used to support the accused’s theory that he killed in self‑defence, it was entitled to ask the accused whether he would undergo a psychiatric assessment. While it would have been preferable if the question acknowledged that the Crown had previously received the accused’s refusal, that issue, coupled with the request for a blood test, does not amount to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The trial judge did not err in law by instructing the jury that the refusal was relevant to the probative value of the defence expert’s evidence. Even if this were not the case, this is a situation where s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) could be applied to rectify an error since there would have been little prejudice caused to the accused.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; At trial, without notice and in the presence of the jury, the Crown asked the accused whether he would agree to submit to a second psychiatric assessment by a particular expert.&nbsp; The accused refused.&nbsp; When an accused relies on a psychiatric assessment in support of any defence, his refusal to be examined for the same purposes by a Crown expert may be the subject of an inference adverse to him and the trial judge must so instruct the jury.&nbsp; This rule is an exception to the fundamental principle of the right to silence.&nbsp; It is therefore essential that this exceptional rule be administered fairly and equitably and in a manner consistent with its underlying principle.&nbsp; From this perspective, it is inappropriate for the Crown to invite the jury to draw a negative conclusion from the accused’s refusal to submit to examination by its experts, when the Crown itself led no evidence challenging the expert opinion offered by the defence.&nbsp; Before taking advantage of the exception, the Crown must first lay the factual foundation of its assertion by challenging the defence’s psychiatric assessment.&nbsp; It may then lead evidence of the accused’s refusal, provided it does so avoiding tactics that are unfair or unduly prejudicial to the accused.&nbsp; Because of how the Crown chose to proceed in this case, it cannot now rely on the exception.&nbsp; The Crown did not retain the services of an expert, and did not contradict the opinion of the defence expert.&nbsp; It confined itself to putting the question here in issue to the accused.&nbsp; The question was asked in the presence of the jury, immediately following a question of the same type which also should never have been asked.&nbsp; The cumulative effect of the accused’s refusal to provide a blood sample and refusal to submit to a second psychiatric assessment, in rapid succession, proved highly prejudicial, for no good reason, to the general credibility of his defence.&nbsp; Moreover, the question itself was not particularly helpful, since it contained an inherent ambiguity regarding the specific subject-matter of the refusal, thus making it difficult for the jury to be invited to draw any conclusion whatsoever from that refusal.&nbsp; In view of the circumstances of this case, the judge’s instructions in his charge to the jury at the end of the trial regarding what use could be made of the accused’s refusal failed to remedy the original error of allowing the question to be asked.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">As to the application of s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii), where an error, or a series of errors, relates to the very essence of the defence and could influence the jury’s assessment of a question of fact that has a very direct bearing on the accused’s guilt, it is difficult to conclude that the rest of the evidence is sufficiently conclusive for the curative provision to be applied.&nbsp; The central issue in this case was whether, at the time the accused shot the victim, he had a reasonable perception that his life was in danger and that he could not otherwise escape from the threat to his safety. The psychiatric evidence of the accused’s pathological fear of the victim was therefore fundamental.&nbsp; As well, the nature of the evidence also required very clear instructions regarding the assessment of the reasonableness of the accused’s beliefs.&nbsp; The errors in the judge’s instructions to the jury concerning these two issues were inevitably fatal, since it is impossible to argue that the verdict would have been the same had it not been for those errors.&nbsp; The cumulative effect of the errors unanimously found by the Court of Appeal to have occurred, combined with the serious and prejudicial error of allowing the Crown to ask the accused whether he would consent to a second psychiatric assessment by its expert, requires that the conviction be set aside and a new trial ordered.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal did not systematically consider the requirements of that provision and, in particular, the cumulative effect of the errors they identified.&nbsp; All that the majority did was to make several isolated references to the fact that the error committed had not prejudiced the accused.&nbsp; That approach does not meet the rigorous requirement of the curative provision of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>

(2d) 245, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the evidence of the accused’s refusal to submit to examination by a Crown psychiatrist, even though he was tendering a psychiatric assessment in support of his defence of insanity, was admissible for the purpose of challenging the credibility of the assessment offered by the defence.&nbsp; On this point, Zuber&nbsp;J.A. said the following (at p. 252):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp.&nbsp;328‑29.&nbsp; This test has also been expressed in terms of whether there is any possibility that if the error had not been committed, a judge or properly instructed jury would have acquitted the accused: see <i>Colpitts</i>, <i>per</i> Spence J., at p.&nbsp;756; <i>R. v.</i> <i>S. (P.L.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, <i>per </i>Sopinka J., at p.&nbsp;919; <i>R. v. Broyles</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at p.&nbsp;620; <i>R. v. B.
