(dissenting):&nbsp; The Crown has failed to satisfy the court to a reasonable certainty that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the jury been properly instructed.&nbsp; When the verdict at trial is an acquittal, the Crown appellant does not benefit from the <i>prima facie</i> assumption that an error warrants a new trial.&nbsp; The onus is on the Crown from the outset to establish that the errors complained of materially affected the verdict, such that a new trial is justified.&nbsp; There were clearly errors in the trial judge's charge to the jury.&nbsp; The trial judge incorrectly stated that V's evidence was that she did not come out and say "no" exactly.&nbsp; However, this error did not change the outcome of the trial.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter the trial judge admitted that he might be mistaken and told the jury that it was their recollection of the evidence, not his, which was important.&nbsp; In addition, the jury's question indicates that they understood the complainant's evidence to be that she said no.&nbsp; The trial judge did not err in denying the jury's request to have that evidence replayed.&nbsp; While any request for instruction or assistance from a jury must be treated carefully, in the case where a jury wishes to have evidence read or played again, problems can arise, especially in procedural fairness.&nbsp; Here the jury were not advised that they could not obtain assistance, but were told they should make a further attempt on their own and that if this attempt failed, assistance would be forthcoming.&nbsp; With respect to the alleged improper characterization of the medical evidence, the trial judge said that the jury would have to consider this evidence as an indication of the force which must have been used, and thus did not remove the evidence from their consideration on the issue of consent.&nbsp; The trial judge's failure to inform the jury that prior inconsistent statements which had not been adopted by the witnesses could be used only for assessing credibility was an error.&nbsp; In this case, however, the inconsistent statements were before the jury to test credibility and not for any other purpose.&nbsp; The final error alleged by the Crown is that the trial judge put the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent to the jury.&nbsp; While the factors listed by the trial judge as supporting the accused's assertion of honest belief in consent do not provide an "air of reality" as required for the defence, this case was one of consent or no consent and credibility was the key issue.&nbsp; Since it is highly unlikely that the jury would have decided the case based on honest but mistaken belief in consent, the verdict would likely have been the same had that defence not been before the jury.&nbsp; The circumstances giving rise to the complaint were decisive.&nbsp; The cramped quarters in which the alleged sexual assault took place were such that some co‑operation of the complainant was necessary.&nbsp; This was consistent with the accused's testimony and inconsistent with that of the complainant.&nbsp; The jury were aware of the circumstances and concluded that the accused proceeded with consent, or at least they had a reasonable doubt about his guilt.&nbsp; This finding of fact represents the collective wisdom of the community as expressed by the jury and should not be interfered with.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570.&nbsp; Furthermore, since recklessness about whether there was consent constitutes one aspect of the <i>mens rea</i> of sexual assault (<i>Pappajohn</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 146), the accused cannot have been reckless in his belief that there was consent.&nbsp; While the belief need not be reasonable, there must be something in the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the alleged assault which lends an air of reality to an <u>honest belief</u> in consent.&nbsp; </span></p>
