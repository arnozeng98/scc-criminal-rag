Matters which relate solely to credibility can only be canvassed in cross‚Äëexamination of the witness whose credibility is sought to be impeached.&nbsp; Here, however, the details of the interview procedure did have relevance which went beyond the children‚Äôs credibility.&nbsp; If there were evidence that the police investigator had influenced the children‚Äôs identification of their abusers in the course of interviewing them, it would bear directly on the question of identity, a fact in issue.&nbsp; The trial judge ought thus to have permitted the defence to refresh the therapist‚Äôs memory using any suitable materials, including the transcripts of the interviews.&nbsp; There is no likelihood, however, that the verdict would have been any different had the defence been allowed to refresh her memory.&nbsp; If there had been any coaching or manipulation during the interviews, the defence would have sought to introduce the transcripts themselves as evidence.&nbsp; It declined to do so and even declined to cross‚Äëexamine the police investigator on the subject.</span></p>

(born 1979), Michelle R. (born 1982) and Kathy R. (born 1982) had been subjected to severe sexual and physical abuse.&nbsp; The children suffered serious psychological trauma as a result of their ordeal, and experienced considerable difficulty giving evidence at trial. </span></p>

M. Paciocco, "The Evidence of Children: Testing the Rules Against What We Know" (1996), 21 <i>Queen‚Äôs L.J.</i> 345, at p. 377.&nbsp; The possibility of fabrication is not so compelling in this case that it warranted excluding the statements altogether.&nbsp; This Court's decision in <i>Khan</i> emphasized the need for "increased flexibility in the interpretation of the hearsay rule to permit the admission in evidence of statements made by children to others about sexual abuse": <i>Khan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 543.&nbsp; The trial judge was correct to rule that the statements were admissible. </span></p>

Credibility is a matter within the competence of lay people.&nbsp; Ordinary people draw conclusions about whether someone is lying or telling the truth on a daily basis.&nbsp; The expert who testifies on credibility is not sworn to the heavy duty of a judge or juror.&nbsp; Moreover, the expert's opinion may be founded on factors which are not in the evidence upon which the judge and juror are duty-bound to render a true verdict.&nbsp; Finally, credibility is a notoriously difficult problem, and the expert's opinion may be all too readily accepted by a frustrated jury as a convenient basis upon which to resolve its difficulties.&nbsp; All these considerations have contributed to the wise policy of the law in rejecting expert evidence on the truthfulness of witnesses.</span></p>

Applying the law to these two factual findings, the trial judge properly found the appellants guilty of the offence involving sexual acts performed on the children ‚Äî sexual assault ‚Äî and not guilty of the offence of gross indecency, which required proof that the children had been forced to perform sexual acts on the appellants.

He did not offer a legal treatise in his oral judgment. He was doubtless telling a number of lay people in the courtroom, notably the accused, what motivated the decision he had made. Anything which he said was given in telegraphic fashion, leaving legally‚Äëtrained counsel to fill in the rest by using their knowledge of the argument just heard, of the law, and of what had become obvious during the trial.</span></p>

It follows that I would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by Major J.</span></p>
