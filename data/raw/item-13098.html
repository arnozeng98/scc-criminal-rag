 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G was charged with being a party, together with her spouse, L, to the murder of their three children at the dawn of the year 2009.&nbsp; According to the Crown’s theory, G was a party to the murder in planning it as part of a murder‑suicide pact and in supplying the murder weapon.&nbsp; She did not act to prevent the children from being poisoned with drinks served by her spouse, which contained Gravol and oxazepam.&nbsp; Thus, she aided L to kill the children.&nbsp; At her jury trial, G submitted in her defence that she had not bought the medication to poison her children, that she was in a dissociative state on December&nbsp;31, 2008 when she wrote some incriminating documents, and that this state meant she could not have formed the specific intent to commit the murders.&nbsp; In the alternative, should her argument based on the absence of <i>mens rea</i> be rejected, she claimed to have abandoned the common purpose of killing the children and to have clearly communicated her intention to do so to her spouse.&nbsp; The jury found G guilty of the first degree murder of her three children.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal upheld the guilty verdict, concluding that the trial judge had not erred in refusing to put the defence of abandonment to the jury, since it was incompatible with the defence’s principal theory.</p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, G’s evidence that she communicated her withdrawal from the deadly plan and that her communication was timely and unequivocal is insufficient.&nbsp; The only relevant passage from her testimony is one in which she used the plural pronoun “we” (using the French pronoun “<i>on</i>” as an equivalent for the plural “<i>nous</i>”) in saying “I told Marc we couldn’t [do that]”.&nbsp; But even if it were assumed that this evidence would be sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that G had communicated her intention to withdraw from the plan and that her communication was timely and unequivocal, that communication would not on its own have sufficed, in the circumstances of this case, for the judge to put the defence of abandonment to the jury.&nbsp; G did more than merely promise to take part in the murder‑suicide pact.&nbsp; She supplied her spouse with the intoxicants he used to cause the children’s deaths.&nbsp; She therefore had to do more either to neutralize the effects of her participation or to prevent the commission of the offence.&nbsp; For example, she could have hidden or destroyed the medication she had purchased, remained watchful and taken the children to a safe place for the evening, insisted that her spouse give her verbal confirmation of what he intended to do, or simply called the authorities.&nbsp; The record did not therefore contain evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could have found that G had abandoned the common unlawful purpose, and could accordingly have acquitted her, if it believed the evidence to be true.&nbsp; The defence of abandonment therefore did not meet the air of reality test, and the trial judge was not required to put the defence to the jury.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</i> Fish&nbsp;J. (dissenting): &nbsp;Canadian courts have for more than 70&nbsp;years held that the defence of abandonment comprises only two essential elements: (i)&nbsp;change of intention; and (ii)&nbsp;where practical and reasonable, timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal.&nbsp; This test has been repeatedly and consistently applied in prosecutions under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec21subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;21(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec21subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;21(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> alike. &nbsp;The defence of abandonment does not require that the accused take steps to neutralize prior participation in the criminal enterprise or to prevent the commission of the offence.&nbsp; While such evidence may strengthen a defence of abandonment, failure to take neutralizing or preventative steps is not fatal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the state of the law universally accepted in Canada at the time of G’s trial, it would be fundamentally unfair at this stage to fault her for failing to demonstrate anything more than a change of intention, plus timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal from the murder‑suicide pact.&nbsp; Since G’s testimony provided some evidence on these two essential elements, there was an air of reality to the defence. &nbsp;The trial judge therefore erred by withholding the defence of abandonment from the jury. &nbsp;Incompatibility between G’s defence of abandonment and her primary defence should not be relied upon to deprive the accused of a defence for which an air of reality has been established.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G testified that she told L his plan did not make sense and he “could not do it”.&nbsp; She also told him that she did not want to be a part of it.&nbsp; She demonstrated her disapproval of the murder‑suicide pact by tearing up two documents: a last will and testament written by her and a story of L’s life containing references to the pact.&nbsp; She was convinced by his facial expression that the murder‑suicide pact was off. &nbsp;This testimony provides some evidence that G no longer intended to participate in the murder‑suicide pact and that she provided timely and unequivocal notice of this change of intention to the principal offender.&nbsp; That the evidence could have left the jury with a reasonable doubt as to G’s guilt is all that was required. It was for the jury to determine whether G’s words and conduct were believable and sufficient to demonstrate timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G is entitled to a fresh trial, where the jury will not be wrongly prevented from considering on its merits her defence of abandonment, however weak and unpromising this Court might believe it to be.</p>

The defence that the accused was in Victoria at the time of the shooting was not only inconsistent with, but it negatived the defence now sought to be set up.&nbsp; Under these circumstances I fail to see how any duty could rest on the trial judge to instruct the jury to consider an alternative defence which the accused, by the defence he did set up, declared had no foundation in fact.

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that in the trial court an accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all alternative defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and, in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the evidence which forms that foundation has been given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or otherwise.&nbsp; <u>What is essential is, that the record contains evidence which, if accepted by the jury, would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid.</u>&nbsp; Where such evidence appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the attention of the jury to that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto.&nbsp; <u>The only evidence appearing in the record upon which even an argument could be founded that the accused shot in self defence is that of Irwin and Bodner that, prior to the shooting, the complainant was running after the accused and his companion, waving his arms and shouting in Oriental.&nbsp; What he was saying we do not know.&nbsp; If it were material to the defence to prove that the words amounted to provocation, the onus was upon the accused to prove what the words were.</u>&nbsp; On any event provocation, which would reduce murder to manslaughter, is not a defence to the charge as laid.&nbsp; Shooting in self defence would constitute a valid defence provided the accused brings himself within <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec53" target="_blank">sections 53<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec54" target="_blank"> 54<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.&nbsp; It is justifiable to repel an unprovoked attack if the force used by the accused is not meant to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is not more than is necessary for the purpose of self defence.&nbsp; It is justified, even if it does cause death or grievous bodily harm, if it is done under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm to himself, and if he believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his own preservation.&nbsp; <u>There is no evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably infer that the accused when he shot the complainant did so under a reasonable apprehension of death or bodily harm to himself, or that he reasonably believed that he could not otherwise save himself from bodily injury.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; pp.&nbsp;616‑17.]</p>

Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, this Court clarified the principle that if two defences are theoretically incompatible, they can nevertheless be put to the jury so long as they both meet the air of reality test.&nbsp; Although Fish&nbsp;J. pointed out that it is dangerous to put theoretically incompatible defences to a jury, he saw no error in the trial judge’s decision to put to the jury, in addition to the primary defence of automatism, the alternative defence of self‑defence the accused wished to raise.&nbsp; Regarding the incompatibility of the two defences, Fish&nbsp;J. wrote the following, at para.&nbsp;10:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the particular defences in issue here — automatism and self‑defence — are, as the Crown suggested on the hearing of this appeal, incompatible in theory, though perhaps not always in practice.&nbsp; That is because self‑defence implies deliberate conduct that is at odds with the fundamental premise of automatism, a state of dissociative, involuntary conduct.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the Court had held in <i>R. v. </i><i><span style="line-height:200%">Faid</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 265, that the trial judge had not erred in refusing to put the defence of provocation to the jury as an alternative to the primary defence of self‑defence.&nbsp; Although it is true that these two defences are incompatible in theory </span>— self‑defence involves reasoned conduct, whereas provocation, on the contrary, presupposes a temporary loss of self‑control — it is important to point out that the refusal was not based on this incompatibility.&nbsp; Rather, the Court found that there was no evidence in the record to support the argument that the accused had acted in the heat of passion.&nbsp; That case was not therefore one in which the effect of the primary defence was to deprive the alternative defence of the support of evidence that was actually in the record.&nbsp; In <i>Faid</i>, the defence of provocation quite simply did not meet the air of reality test, because there was no evidence related to its elements.&nbsp; <i>Faid</i> is one illustration of the principle that any defence with an air of reality should be put to the jury.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellant’s evidence that she communicated her withdrawal from the deadly plan and that her communication was timely and unequivocal is insufficient for the purposes of the air of reality test.&nbsp; To meet that test, it is not enough to simply identify “some evidence” or “any evidence”; the evidence must be “reasonably capable of supporting the inferences required for the defence to succeed” (<i>Cinous</i>, at paras.&nbsp;82‑83).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only relevant passage from the appellant’s testimony is the one in which she used the plural pronoun “we” (using the French pronoun “<i>on</i>” as an equivalent for the plural “<i>nous</i>”) in saying “I told Marc <u>we</u> couldn’t [do that]”.&nbsp; This passage stands alone in the appellant’s principal narrative to the effect that she never agreed to the murder‑suicide pact, that she wrote the incriminating letters while in a dissociative state and that she told her spouse she disagreed with what he was planning to do as soon as she realized what it was.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, even if it were assumed that the evidence the appellant relies upon would be sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that she had communicated her intention to withdraw from the plan and that her communication was timely and unequivocal, that communication would not on its own have sufficed, in the circumstances of this case, for the judge to put the defence of abandonment to the jury.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did more than merely promise to take part in the murder‑suicide pact.&nbsp; She supplied her spouse with the intoxicants he used to cause the children’s deaths.&nbsp; She therefore had to do more either to neutralize the effects of her participation or to prevent the commission of the offence.&nbsp; For example, she could have hidden or destroyed the medication she had purchased, remained watchful and taken the children to a safe place for the evening, insisted that her spouse give her verbal confirmation of what he intended to do, or simply called the authorities.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the record did not contain evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could have found that the appellant had abandoned the common unlawful purpose, and could accordingly have acquitted her, if it believed the evidence to be true.&nbsp; The defence of abandonment therefore did not meet the air of reality test, and the trial judge was not required to put the defence to the jury.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the law as it was then understood, the trial judge was bound to put abandonment to the jury if there was evidence that the appellant (a) had changed ― or “abandoned” ― her earlier intention to aid or abet the murder of her children, and (b) had adequately communicated to her husband that she had withdrawn from their pact.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court has repeatedly held that the defence of abandonment includes <i>no other essential elements</i>.&nbsp; And our attention has not been drawn to a single Canadian decision to the contrary, at any level.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there<i> was</i> evidence at Ms. Gauthier’s trial upon which a properly instructed jury might well have found that she had abandoned the suicide pact in respect of which she was charged and convicted of murder.&nbsp; Or at least have been left with a reasonable doubt on this issue, which would of course have sufficed to warrant Ms. Gauthier’s acquittal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[74]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a matter of law, the appellant is entitled, in my respectful view, to a fresh trial, where the jury will not be wrongly prevented from considering on its merits Ms. Gauthier’s defence of abandonment, however weak and unpromising we might believe it to be.&nbsp; I am aware of no legal principle that permits us to deprive her of that right.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[75]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his thorough and thoughtful reasons, Justice Wagner proposes that we now adopt additional requirements for a valid defence of abandonment where the accused, as in this case, has done something to aid or abet the commission of the offence before satisfying the two established elements of abandonment.&nbsp; As we shall see, there are strong reasons of policy and precedent for resisting the proposed changes.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[76]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we shall see as well, I am not persuaded that the modifications we endorse should be made applicable on a retrial of the appellant.&nbsp; But even if we decide that they are, the appellant would at least be entitled to a fair opportunity to satisfy those newly recognized requirements.&nbsp; Her failure to do so at her first trial ― prior to their recognition by this Court or, it seems, by <i>any</i> Canadian court ― can hardly deprive Ms. Gauthier of a proper opportunity to do so now.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[77]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect for those who are of a different view, I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the appellant’s convictions and order a new trial.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, this approach overlooks the fact that both s. 21(1) and s.&nbsp;21(2) can involve active participation by the accused: see for example <i>Henderson </i>and <i>Miller</i><span style="line-height:200%">.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <i>Whitehouse </i>test has been repeatedly and consistently applied in prosecutions under s. 21(1) and s. 21(2) alike.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application of the <i>Whitehouse</i> criteria to an aiding and abetting case was endorsed very recently by this Court in 2009, and even more recently by other Canadian courts: <i>Bird</i> (affirming Costigan J.A.’s dissent); <i>Ball</i>, at paras. 44-47; and <i>Leslie</i>, at paras. 552-58.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <i>Whitehouse </i>itself involved parties to an offence who had “aided and abetted in the commission of the crime”: p. 424.&nbsp; They had “performed part, at least, of the tasks assigned to them”: again, at p. 424.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was out of this factual context that the test for abandonment was born.&nbsp; And the court identified only two requirements:&nbsp; the first, change of intention; the second, timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal ― that is, the accused must clearly communicate to the principal “that if he proceeds upon it he does so without the <i>further aid and assistance</i> of those who withdraw”: <i>Whitehouse</i>,<i> </i>at p. 425 (emphasis added).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">As the language of this oft-cited passage makes clear, the <i>Whitehouse</i> test for </span>abandonment expressly contemplates prior aid and assistance.&nbsp; <span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, to suggest that an accused under either subsection of s.&nbsp;21 must neutralize prior involvement disregards an important rationale of the defence of abandonment, namely, giving the principal offender the opportunity to abandon the criminal objective.&nbsp; As Allan Manson explains in “Re-codifying Attempts, Parties, and Abandoned Intentions” (1989), 14 <i>Queen’s L.J</i>. 85, at p. 101:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">. . . the premise upon which <i>Whitehouse </i>is based:&nbsp; “Let it be known, if you go then you go alone.”&nbsp; Unequivocal withdrawal and the element of timeliness are sufficiently expansive to accommodate abettors and aiders alike because, as in <i>Becerra </i>and <i>Gundy</i>, the aim is to compel the principal to reconsider the objective in time to abandon it.&nbsp; This, after all, is the preventative rationale for party responsibility.&nbsp; Thus the defence of abandonment as structured in <i>Whitehouse </i>can apply with equal fairness and effect to all parties including aiders by interpreting timeliness in relation to the offence and the goal of ultimate abandonment.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even the most ardent proponents of a more stringent abandonment defence recognize that to require neutralizing or preventative steps would necessitate a change to Canadian law: see M. Campbell, “Turning Back the Clock: Aiders and the Defence of Abandonment” (2010), 14 <i>Can. </i><i>Crim. L.R. </i>1, at pp. 16-17.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts in the United Kingdom, approving <i>Whitehouse</i>, have concluded that neutralizing or preventative steps are not required to establish abandonment.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. O’Flaherty</i>, [2004] EWCA Crim 526, [2004] 2 Cr. App. R. 20 (p. 315), at para. 60, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that whether an accused has done enough “to demonstrate that he or she is withdrawing from the joint enterprise . . . is ultimately a question of fact and degree for the jury”.&nbsp; The jury should account for “the nature of the assistance and encouragement already given and how imminent the infliction of the fatal injury or injuries is, as well as the nature of the action said to constitute withdrawal”.&nbsp; And, the court <i>explicitly rejected the proposition that effective withdrawal requires reasonable steps to prevent the crime</i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">In cases of assistance it has sometimes been suggested that, for there to be an effective withdrawal, reasonable steps must have been taken to prevent the crime.&nbsp; It is clear, however, this is not necessary. [Para. 60; see also para. 61.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">See also <i>R. v.</i> <i>Otway</i>, [2011] EWCA Crim 3 (BAILII), at para. 32, where the court held that efforts to prevent the crime were relevant but not required for withdrawal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[92]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">Justice Wagner relies on <i>R. v. Fournier</i>, 2007 QCCA 1822 (CanLII),<i> </i>to support his position that mere communication of changed intention should henceforth be insufficient for abandonment in s. 21(1) cases (para. 48 of Justice Wagner’s reasons).&nbsp; However, in <i>Fournier</i>, unlike this case, the defence of abandonment was <i>not</i> kept from the jury.&nbsp; Indeed, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge properly instructed the jury that abandonment required timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal: <i>Fournier</i>, at paras. </span><span style="line-height:200%">18-20. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[93]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">I agree with my colleague that the internally repentant archer cannot, having let the arrow fly, seek refuge in the defence of abandonment (para. 47 of Justice Wagner’s reasons).&nbsp; The defence fails in Sir John Smith’s illustration not because preventative or neutralizing steps are required, but rather because notice of withdrawal comes too late, or not at all. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[94]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These authorities all make clear that the defence of abandonment does not require that the accused take steps to neutralize prior participation in the criminal enterprise or to prevent the commission of the offence.&nbsp; While such evidence may strengthen a defence of abandonment, failure to take neutralizing or preventative steps is not fatal.&nbsp; Thus, for example, in <i>R. v. Edwards</i>, 2001 BCSC 275 (CanLII), at para. 186, the accused’s efforts to stop the commission of the offence were treated as evidence that the<i> Whitehouse </i>requirements were met ― not as additional requirements of the defence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[95]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If we were to accept that the defence of abandonment now requires that an accused take steps to neutralize previous assistance or to prevent the commission of the crime, I am inclined to believe that this change should only be given prospective effect ― at least in this case.&nbsp; As Don Stuart explains in<i> Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise</i> (6th ed. 2011), at p. 9: “It is almost universally accepted that the view that judges merely declare existing law rather than create new law is outmoded and wrong.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But on any view of the matter, in light of the state of the law universally accepted in Canada at the time of the appellant’s trial, it would be fundamentally unfair at this stage to fault the appellant for failing to demonstrate anything more than a change of intention, plus timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal from the murder-suicide pact.&nbsp; Since the appellant’s testimony provided some evidence on these two essential elements, there was an air of reality to the defence.&nbsp; The trial judge therefore erred by withholding the defence of abandonment from the jury.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" align="center" style="text-align:center">III</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[97]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Justice Wagner that the “incompatibility” between Ms. Gauthier’s defence of abandonment and her primary defence did not justify the trial judge’s decision to prevent the jury from considering them both.&nbsp; And I am therefore content to add only these brief comments on the issue of incompatibility.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[98]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Incompatibility should not be relied upon to deprive the accused of a defence for which an air of reality has been established, particularly where ― as in this case ― defence counsel has requested that it be included in the judge’s charge: A.R., at pp. 1018 and 1037-38.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[99]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Kellock J. stated in <i>Henderson</i>: “It is a paramount principle of law that when a defence, however weak it may be, is raised by a person charged, it should be fairly put before the jury”: p. 241.&nbsp; Taschereau J. likewise emphasized the accused’s “fundamental right . . . to have all the features of [the] defence adequately put to the jury”: <i>Henderson</i>, at p. 237.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" align="center" style="text-align:center">IV</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[100]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For abandonment to be left for the jury, there must be some evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could form a reasonable doubt on the two essential elements of the defence: <i>R. v. Cinous</i>, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 2, 49, 52-54 and 83.&nbsp; In my view, the appellant’s testimony satisfied this modest evidentiary threshold.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[101]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there was no suggestion at trial by the Crown― nor finding by the trial judge or the Court of Appeal ― that the defence of abandonment lacked an air of reality.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[102]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that she told Marc Laliberté his plan did not make sense and he <span style="font-variant:small-caps">[translation</span>] “could not do it” (“<i>pouvait pas faire ça</i>”).&nbsp; She also told him that she did not want to be a part of it.&nbsp; She demonstrated her disapproval of the murder-suicide pact by tearing up two documents: a last will and testament written by the appellant and a story of Marc Laliberté’s life containing references to the pact.&nbsp; She was convinced by his facial expression that the murder-suicide pact was off: A.R., at pp. 834-35 and 910-11.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[103]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This testimony provides <i>some</i> <i>evidence</i> that the appellant no longer intended to participate in the murder-suicide pact and that she provided timely and unequivocal notice of this change of intention to the principal offender.&nbsp; That the evidence could have left the jury with a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt is all that was required.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[104]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the appellant ultimately “did enough” to communicate timely and unequivocal withdrawal was a question of fact that should have been left for the jury to decide: <i>P.K.</i>, at para. 11; <i>O’Flaherty</i>, at para. 60; <i>Cinous</i>,<i> </i>at paras. 52 and 54.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, it was for the jury to determine whether the appellant’s words and conduct were believable and sufficient to demonstrate timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal.&nbsp; As Taschereau J. stated, again in <i>Henderson</i>, at p. 237:&nbsp; “The question whether the agreement has been put to an end, must be judged in view of all the circumstances revealed by the evidence, and I have no doubt that it is a question for the jury.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I feel bound to conclude that the trial judge, by declining to instruct on the defence of abandonment, encroached “on the jury’s traditional function as arbiter of fact”: <i>Cinous</i>, at para. 56.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" align="center" style="text-align:center">V</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the appellant’s convictions, and order a new trial.</p>
