Zundel</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 731, the Court had to consider the validity of a provision that criminalized the wilful publication of a statement that the publisher knows to be false.&nbsp; The Court interpreted this provision to require a showing by the Crown that the accused published a statement that was in fact false (at p.&nbsp;747).</p>

[t]hat the goods are stolen goods”.&nbsp; Twenty‑five years later, the same court held, in <i>R. v. Stevens</i> (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 238, at p.&nbsp;307, that the offence of “publishing a defamatory libel known to be false” will be established only upon a showing that the libel actually is false.</p>

Irwin</i>, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 50 (Alta. S.C.A.D.), in which it was held that an accused who sold drugs to an undercover police officer for the stated purpose of helping to procure the miscarriage of a woman was guilty of the offence of “suppl[ying] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. noxious thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. knowing that it is intended to be used or employed to procure the miscarriage of a female person”.&nbsp; The Appellate Division reached this conclusion even though the undercover police officer did not intend to procure a miscarriage.&nbsp; On appeal, this Court affirmed the decision of the Appellate Division, but on the ground that the words “knowing that it is intended&nbsp; to be used or employed to procure the miscarriage of a female person” referred to the intention of the one selling the noxious thing, not to the intention of the one purchasing it.&nbsp; Because the accused certainly knew his own intention, which was to sell noxious things for the purpose of assisting in the procurement of a miscarriage, the Court held that the knowledge requirement had been satisfied.&nbsp; See <i>Irwin v. The Queen</i>, [1968] S.C.R. 462, at p.&nbsp;465.&nbsp; Thus, <i>Irwin</i> is ultimately consistent with the other cases on the meaning of the word “knowing”.&nbsp; The Court did not hold in <i>Irwin</i> that it is possible to know something that is not the case.&nbsp; It held rather that the accused did know what the statute required him to know, which was his own intention.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Three main forms of impossibility have set the framework for contemporary debate.&nbsp; First, there is impossibility due to inadequate means (Type I).&nbsp; For example, A tries to kill B by shooting at him from too great a distance or by administering too small a dose of poison; C tries to break into a house without the equipment which would be necessary to force the windows or doors.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The second form of impossibility arises where an actor is prevented from completing the offence because some element of its <i>actus reus</i> cannot be brought within the criminal design (Type II).&nbsp; For example, A tries to kill B by shooting him when he is asleep in bed, but in fact B has already died of natural causes; C tries to steal money from a safe which is empty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The third form of impossibility arises where the actor’s design is completed but the offence is still not committed because some element of the <i>actus reus</i> is missing (Type III).&nbsp; For example, A may take possession of property believing it to have been stolen when it has not been; B may smuggle a substance for reward believing it to be a narcotic when it is sugar.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

R.</i>, at p.&nbsp;168.&nbsp; The <i>actus reus</i> is the fact of agreement: <i>D.P.P. v. Nock</i>, at p.&nbsp;66.&nbsp; The agreement reached by the co‑conspirators may contemplate a number of acts or offences.&nbsp; Any number of persons may be privy to it.&nbsp; Additional persons may join the ongoing scheme while others may drop out.&nbsp; So long as there is a continuing overall, dominant plan there may be changes in methods of operation, personnel, or victims, without bringing the conspiracy to an end.&nbsp; <u>The important inquiry is not as to the acts done in pursuance of the agreement, but whether there was, in fact, a common agreement to which the acts are referable and to which all of the alleged offenders were privy</u>.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Conspiracy is in fact a more “preliminary” crime than attempt, since the offence is considered to be complete before any acts are taken that go beyond mere preparation to put the common design into effect.&nbsp; The Crown is simply required to prove a meeting of the minds with regard to a common design to do something unlawful, specifically the commission of an indictable offence.&nbsp; See <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec465subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;465(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>c</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

Further, each of the conspirators must have a genuine intention to participate in the agreement.&nbsp; A person cannot be a conspirator if he or she merely pretends to agree.&nbsp; In <i>O’Brien</i>, Rand&nbsp;J. held at p.&nbsp;670 that</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Where one member of a so‑called conspiracy is a police informant who never intends to carry out the common design, there can be no conspiracy involving that person.&nbsp; Nonetheless, a conspiracy can still exist between other parties to the same agreement.

Canada was seeking the return from the State of California of a Canadian accused of murder.&nbsp; The fugitive was apprehended by the police in California who, at the request of the Canadian authorities, questioned him.&nbsp; Although the conduct of the investigation was lawful in the United States, the police failed to advise the fugitive of his rights to counsel in the manner that would be required by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The fugitive argued that the statement he made to the California police should accordingly be excluded from his Canadian trial.&nbsp; McLachlin J., writing for the Court, held that in order to find a violation of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, it would be necessary to hold that the California police were subject to the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</i>&nbsp; This would “run counter to the settled rule that a state is only competent to enforce its laws within its own territorial boundaries” (p.&nbsp;215).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Streu</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1521.&nbsp; The accused’s <u>belief</u> that the goods were stolen was not enough to ground a conviction for possession of goods <u>knowing</u> them to be stolen.&nbsp; The Court referred with approval to the statement of Dickson J.A. (later C.J.C.) in <i>R. v. Vogelle and Reid</i>, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 171 (Man. C.A.), at p. 177, that, “[i]n order for an accused to be found guilty of the offence of receiving stolen goods it is essential the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt ... [t]hat the goods are stolen goods ”.&nbsp; To now equate “knowing” with “believing” would reverse long established authority to the contrary.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">(1) The putative fact approach would in practice result in setting aside the temporal and spatial limits upon the penal law.&nbsp; Suppose a penal statute comes into force at midnight.&nbsp; A man may think he is acting at 12:05 a.m. (after it has come into force), when in fact he was acting at 11:55 p.m. (before it came into force).&nbsp; Is he guilty of attempting to commit what would be an offence under the Act if his facts were right?&nbsp; (Observe that this is not a question of mistake of law, a mistake as to what the Act says; the mistake concerns the facts.)&nbsp; A man may think he is acting within the bounds of territorial jurisdiction, when he is in fact acting just outside those bounds.&nbsp; Or a person who is not a British citizen but who believes he is a British citizen (as a result of mistaking his birth-place) may assist an enemy abroad.&nbsp; Is he guilty of attempted treason?&nbsp; If a person is not subject to the law of treason, how can he be guilty of attempted treason?</p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">(2) My second type of problem concerns a particular type of justification.&nbsp; A statute may make it an offence to pursue some activity without a licence.&nbsp; A person may act believing he has no licence, when in fact he has one.&nbsp; For example, a driver stopped by the police may untruthfully assert that his wife was driving; the police question him closely, and it transpires that he was driving, and believed he had been disqualified from driving, but in fact he had not.&nbsp; Is he guilty of attempting to drive while disqualified?&nbsp; It needs no demonstration that an affirmative answer would be strange, though it is apparently the answer that was intended to be given (in theory) under the Criminal Attempts Act.
