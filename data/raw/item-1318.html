Stinchcombe</i> involving disclosure of the identity of the Crown informant.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Accordingly, the extent of disclosure was made clear by Proulx&nbsp;J.A.'s reasons.&nbsp; The <u>timing</u> as to this disclosure is also made sufficiently clear.&nbsp; It is true that the first requirement of disclosure in Proulx's judgment refers to Billy Joe's evidence being disclosed "before trial", but the timing as to disclosure of the other two requirements is not stated.&nbsp; Yet, that the other two elements had to be done "before trial" is implicit from the other portions of Proulx J.A.'s reasons.&nbsp; Identity and whereabouts being material to the ability of the defence to make full answer and defence, they had to be disclosed prior to trial.&nbsp; Indeed, the Crown's attempt to make Billy Joe available at the aborted interview supports this view of the timing of disclosure in Proulx J.A.'s decision.&nbsp; This did, obviously, leave the Crown with some discretion as to the exact point disclosure was made prior to trial, but such disclosure had to be within sufficient time to enable the appellants to make full answer and defence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Stinchcombe</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 1, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, 9 C.R. (4th) 277 (S.C.C.).&nbsp; It argues that on February 17, 1992, disclosure of the name and whereabouts of Billy Joe was not proper for two main reasons.&nbsp; The first is that there was a real danger for the life of this individual who has already been the subject of a first attempted murder.&nbsp; The second is that he, represented by counsel, had indicated that he would ask, at trial, to testify under a pseudonym, which moreover Proulx J.A. permitted him to do in his judgment.&nbsp; The Crown's position is, therefore, that <u>in these particular circumstances, it was for the trial judge, before the trial had actually begun, to make the necessary decisions in this regard</u>.&nbsp; I agree with this position.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, i.e., much beyond the type of disclosure that can be ordered by a trial judge, let alone a Court of Appeal.&nbsp; The Crown can only be ordered to produce what it has, and it does not "have" people.&nbsp; I agree with my colleagues in this respect that "[t]he obligation of the Crown does not extend to producing its witnesses for oral discovery" (at para. 18).&nbsp; The appellants' argument on this point must accordingly fail.</span></p>
