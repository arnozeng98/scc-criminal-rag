Richard Therrien‚Äôs sister was, however, a friend of Jacques Rose.&nbsp; From October 17 to November 6, 1970, Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, Francis Simard and Bernard Lortie, the four F.L.Q. members associated with the kidnapping of the minister Pierre Laporte, hid in that apartment.&nbsp; Richard Therrien‚Äôs involvement in these events was quite minor: he stayed in the apartment with them for only a few nights, preferring to keep his distance.&nbsp; At one point, he went to get materials so that they could build a hideout, and at another time he mailed three letters at the request of one of these persons.</p>

From 1976 to 1996, he practised law in various provincial legal aid offices in a competent and dignified manner, thus winning the respect of his colleagues and members of the bench.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">In that definition, the word on which we desire to lay emphasis is the word ‚Äúdetermines‚Äù.&nbsp; In order that a judgment may come under the definition, it must have, ‚Äúin whole or in part,‚Äù determined or put an end to the issue raised and in respect to which the judgment was rendered.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This concept was repeated in <i>Wartime Housing Ltd. v.

(G.)</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 597, at para.&nbsp;8.&nbsp; We must therefore begin by considering the instruments by which jurisdiction is assigned.&nbsp; The general jurisdiction of the Quebec Court of Appeal is set out in s. 9 <i>C.J.A.</i> and art. 25 of the <i>Code of Civil Procedure</i>, R.S.Q., c. C-25 (‚Äú<i>C.C.P.</i>‚Äù).&nbsp; It has jurisdiction over all causes, matters or things appealed from.&nbsp; In addition, it is given special jurisdiction by certain specific provisions:&nbsp; this is precisely the situation in the case of s. 95 <i>C.J.A.</i> in respect of judicial ethics.&nbsp; What is the extent of the authority thus conferred on it? Is it in the nature of a purely advisory opinion, or of a decision? From a careful study of the law and of its context and purpose, I&nbsp;conclude that the report of the Quebec Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 95 <i>C.J.A.</i> is in the nature of a decision.&nbsp; There are several factors that support this conclusion.</p>

T-16, r. 4.1.&nbsp; For example, I note that in this case, the committee of inquiry sat for eight days and heard more than 15 witnesses.&nbsp; It then analyzed the facts at length and made its findings, and then issued a recommendation. &nbsp;Accordingly, the Minister has the benefit of the administrative body‚Äôs specialized knowledge and experience.</p>

H. Russell, <i>The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government</i> (1987), at p.&nbsp;181, and M.&nbsp;L. Friedland, <i>A Place Apart: Judicial Independence and Accountability in Canada</i> (1995), a report prepared for the Canadian Judicial Council, at p.&nbsp;130.&nbsp; Its report is a mandatory stage in the proceeding that may lead to the removal of a judge of the Court of Qu√©bec.&nbsp; The fact that s.&nbsp;95 <i>C.J.A.</i> provides that ‚Äú[t]he Government may remove a judge <u>only upon a report</u> of the Court of Appeal‚Äù (emphasis added) is therefore not happenstance.&nbsp; Accordingly, it plays a vital role in the administration of justice in the province, and this is one factor that suggests that it should be recognized as a decision.</p>

Tobiass</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391.&nbsp; In that case, the Court agreed with the conclusion reached by the Federal Court of Appeal in <i>Luitjens v. Canada (Secretary of State)</i> (1992), 9 C.R.R.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The Queen</i>, [1980] A.C. 125, cited by the respondents, which was a reference by the Governor-General to the Court of Appeal of New Zealand regarding whether a convicted person should be pardoned.&nbsp; Although these two decisions may bear some <i>prima facie</i> resemblance to the present appeal, I believe that the fact situations were different.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, the report of the Quebec Court of Appeal has broader effect.&nbsp; Unlike s.&nbsp;690(<i>c</i>) of the <i>Code</i>, it is not optional, but essential to the process of removing a judge and the administration of justice in general.&nbsp; Furthermore, the fact that it is judicial and in the nature of a decision is fundamental to the constitutionality of the proceeding as a whole.&nbsp; These considerations do not apply to applications for the mercy of the Crown under s.&nbsp;690(<i>c</i>) of the<i> Code</i>.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Although the wording does not refer explicitly to the fact that exercise of the jurisdiction of grievance arbitrators regarding the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the agreement precludes any concurrent proceedings in the ordinary law courts, this Court saw, here as well, the clear expression of the legislature‚Äôs intention in that regard.&nbsp; However, this Court was careful to say that the model by which arbitrators have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from the collective agreement did not close the door to all other actions in the courts between the employer and employee.</p>

Conseil de la magistrature</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 267, whereas he, who is threatened with removal, is deprived of any remedy.&nbsp; It is untrue to say that no remedy is available to the appellant.&nbsp; Quite the contrary, the proceeding provided for in s. 95 <i>C.J.A.</i> gives him special protection and provides him with a judicial forum in which he can be heard.&nbsp; Furthermore, this is, so to speak, a remedy as of right, since it is a mandatory part of the process that the Minister must follow before removing him from the bench, whereas extraordinary remedies are discretionary.&nbsp; I would add, in conclusion on this point, that the constitutional considerations that apply when a judge is reprimanded are not as significant as when his or her appointment may be revoked by the Executive.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">[<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>]&nbsp; From the time that the first appellate administrative tribunals emerged in the United Kingdom early in the century, advocates of judicialization and advocates of procedural autonomy confronted each other, and the question was raised at that time as to whether or not judicial procedure should be used as a suppletive source or as a model to be emulated.&nbsp; <i>Local Government Board v. Arlidge</i> [[1915] A.C. 120 (H.L.)] may be regarded as the leading decision, firmly moving procedure in the direction of autonomy and dejudicialization. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">Lord Haldane began by explaining that granting appellate jurisdiction to an administrative agency rather than a court was the expression of a change in legislative policy and that the consequences of this political choice must be accepted.&nbsp; The agency must, of course, act in a judicial manner, but it must be assumed, absent any indication to the contrary, that the legislator wished to let the agency determine its own procedure so that it could act efficiently.&nbsp; Lord Shaw even went so far as to warn the judiciary against the temptation to impose its own methods on administrative tribunals.&nbsp; It is to him that we owe the famous proposition: the tribunal is the master of its own procedure.</p>

Furthermore, under s. 279, if the report of the inquiry establishes that the complaint is justified, the Conseil, according to the recommendations of the report of the inquiry, reprimands the judge or recommends that the Minister file a motion with the Court of Appeal in accordance with s. 95 <i>C.J.A</i>.&nbsp; In this second situation, once again, the legislature has provided that the Conseil shall yield to the committee‚Äôs decision.&nbsp; I acknowledged this situation in <i>Ruffo</i>, at para.&nbsp;67, where I pointed out that ‚Äú[u]nder s.&nbsp;279 <i>CJA</i>, if the report establishes that the complaint is justified, the Conseil <u>must implement the Comit√©‚Äôs recommendations</u>‚Äù (emphasis added).&nbsp; I therefore find that the terms used by the legislation are mandatory and reflect a clear intent on the part of the legislature to authorize delegation of the powers of inquiry and decision regarding the justification for a complaint.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In light of this, the actual conduct of the case is the responsibility not of the parties but of the Comit√© itself, on which the <i>CJA</i> confers a pre-eminent role in establishing rules of procedure, researching the facts and calling witnesses.&nbsp; <u>Any idea of prosecution is thus structurally excluded.&nbsp; The complaint is merely what sets the process in motion.&nbsp; Its effect is not to initiate litigation between two parties.&nbsp; This means that</u> where the Conseil decides to conduct an inquiry after examining a complaint lodged by one of its members, the Comit√© does not thereby become both judge and party: as I noted earlier, the Comit√©‚Äôs primary role is to search for the truth; this involves not a <i>lis inter partes</i> but a true inquiry in which the Comit√©, through its own research and that of the complainant and of the judge who is the subject of the complaint, finds out about the situation in order to determine the most appropriate recommendation based on the circumstances of the case before it.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This passage clearly shows that the committee‚Äôs purpose is not to act as a judge or even as a decision-maker responsible for settling a dispute; on the contrary, it is&nbsp;to gather the facts and evidence in order, ultimately, to make a recommendation to the Conseil de la magistrature.&nbsp; It also illustrates the intention of avoiding the creation of an adversarial atmosphere between two opponents each seeking to prevail.&nbsp; When there was no judge or parties, counsel for the committee could not have been in a conflict of interest.&nbsp; For instance, when he examined and cross-examined the witnesses he was not acting as a prosecutor, but rather was providing the committee with help and assistance in carrying out the mandate assigned to it by the statute.</p>

Thus, to the public, judges not only swear by taking their oath to serve the ideals of Justice and Truth on which the rule of law in Canada and the foundations of our democracy are built, but they are asked to embody them (Justice Jean Beetz, Introduction of the first speaker at the conference marking the 10th anniversary of the Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, observations collected in <i>M√©langes Jean Beetz</i> (1995), at pp.&nbsp;70-71).</p>

Many factors, including unfair or uninformed criticism, or simple misunderstanding of the judicial role, can adversely influence public confidence in and respect for the judiciary.&nbsp; Another factor which is capable of undermining public respect and confidence is any conduct of judges, in and out of court, demonstrating a lack of integrity.&nbsp; Judges should, therefore, strive to conduct themselves in a way that will sustain and contribute to public respect and confidence in their integrity, impartiality, and good judgment.</p>

Cie Price Lt√©e</i>, J.E. 81‚Äë866 (Sup. Ct.); <i>Commission des droits de la personne du Qu√©bec v. Ville de Beauport</i>, [1981] C.P. 292. In fact, it was in response to the conservative approach taken by the courts in interpreting social condition that the legislature amended the <i>Quebec Charter</i> in 1982 by adding s. 18.2: S.Q. 1982, c.&nbsp;61, s.&nbsp;5; see also Singleton, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;472. Finally, even if the information related to one of the grounds listed in s. 10, the question would still be permitted in the selection process for persons qualified for appointment as judges, since the distinction is based on the aptitudes or qualifications required for judicial office, which is deemed non-discriminatory by s. 20 of the <i>Quebec Charter</i>.</p>

Brunelle, ‚ÄúLa Charte qu√©b√©coise et les sanctions de l‚Äôemployeur contre les auteurs d‚Äôactes criminels ≈ìuvrant en milieu √©ducatif‚Äù (1995), 29 <i>R.J.T.</i> 313, at pp.&nbsp;336-37; Singleton, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;473, and Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse du Qu√©bec, <i>Lignes directrices pour l‚Äôapplication de l‚Äôarticle 18.2</i> (document adopted at the 306th (special) session of the Commission held on May&nbsp;12,1988, by its resolution COM‚Äë306‚Äë9.1.2), at p.&nbsp;4.&nbsp; A provision of that nature can hardly be reconciled with the requirements of judicial office. In my opinion the legislature, being concerned with preserving the independence, impartiality and integrity of the judiciary, cannot have intended to deprive the government of its discretion to refuse to vest judicial authority in candidates whose past would be likely to undermine the invaluable confidence of the public in its justice system.&nbsp; For these reasons, I find that s. 18.2 does not apply to the appellant‚Äôs situation.&nbsp; I will now consider the nature of the sanction that the majority of the Conseil de la magistrature and the Court of Appeal chose to impose on him.</p>

The issue of confidence governs every aspect of this case, and ultimately dictates the result.&nbsp; Thus, before making a recommendation that a judge be removed, the question to be asked is whether the conduct for which he or she is blamed is so manifestly and totally contrary to the impartiality, integrity and independence of the judiciary that the confidence of individuals appearing before the judge, or of the public in its justice system, would be undermined, rendering the judge incapable of performing the duties of his office (Friedland, <i>supra</i>, at pp.&nbsp;80-81).</p>
