24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Bastarache, Deschamps and <b>Abella</b> JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp;&nbsp;The presumption of judicial integrity acknowledges that judges are bound by their judicial oaths and will carry out the duties they have sworn to uphold.&nbsp; This includes not only a presumption of impartiality, but also of legal knowledge.&nbsp; The presumption of integrity is rebuttable only by cogent evidence.&nbsp; The threshold for displacing the presumption is high:&nbsp; it must be demonstrated that a reasonably informed person would be satisfied that there was a real likelihood that the trial judge had not complied with the judicial oath of office in the manner and timing of the issuance of the reasons.&nbsp; The presumption is not to insulate decisions from judicial review but to ensure that inappropriate assumptions, such as bias, are not idiosyncratically factored into the review. [28-29] [34] [40]</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A delay, either in reaching a result or in explaining it, would not lead a reasonably informed observer to conclude that the judge had disregarded the oath of office and would not, without more, represent an error of law justifying ignoring either the result or the reasons.&nbsp; Issuing the reasons after a verdict does not mean that the verdict was not thought through before it was delivered.&nbsp; Reasons explain what a judge has decided to do and should be accepted as being honest reflections of that decision, whether delivered with or after the result, unless their content reflects the absence of judicial integrity.&nbsp; Inordinate delay may result in critical comment by a reviewing court but should not result in a refusal even to consider the reasons.&nbsp; Such an approach would do a greater disservice to the public perception of the integrity of the system than an undesirable delay.&nbsp; Here, given the complexity of the case, the time taken to reach the verdicts and to articulate reasons for judgment, even when considered with the other surrounding factors identified by the majority, did not represent the level of cogency necessary to displace the presumption of integrity.&nbsp; The reasons were responsive to the facts and issues at trial and were entitled to be reviewed on their merits.&nbsp;[40] [44] [46] [47] [50] [51]</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">On the day of the assault, one Jason Adams, a resident of the apartment building, observed a man with a bicycle sleeping in the second floor hallway. He caught quick glimpses of the man on three occasions between 6.15 a.m. and 6.30 a.m. Shortly before 7.00 a.m., another resident observed the sleeping man and informed the victim.&nbsp; Between 7.00 a.m. and 7.30 a.m., Mr. Adams' wife overheard the victim talking with a male whose voice she did not recognize.&nbsp; She then heard a noise she believed to be a bicycle going down the flight of stairs.&nbsp; At approximately 10.30 a.m., the letter carrier found the victim at the bottom of the stairwell on the main floor of the apartment building.&nbsp; He had been badly beaten.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The sole identification evidence was that given by Mr. Adams.&nbsp; In a first photo line-up (November 28, 2000), he identified someone other than the Appellant as the person who resembled the man sleeping in the hallway (A.B. 29/35-30/5; E23-E25).&nbsp; A second photo line-up was prepared which included the photo of the Appellant (December 14, 2000), but did not include a photograph of the person previously identified.&nbsp; In addition, the Appellant’s photograph was one of three that appeared in both the first and second line-up (A.B. E28-E30).&nbsp; The witness testified that the Appellant’s face as depicted in the photo “looked similar to the face [he saw] in the stairwell.&nbsp; He added that “minus the bruise and the shorter hair . . . the face looks very familiar.” (A.B. 31/27-32/15) The Appellant argued that the second photo line-up was flawed due to the manner in which the Appellant’s photo stood out as compared to a number of the surrounding pictures. &nbsp;In addition, Mr. Adams was unable to positively identify the Appellant in Court.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="Section9">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The trial judge recognized that the identification of the Appellant by Adams was “the cornerstone of the Crown’s case” (A.B. F29, para. 54).&nbsp; He found that there had been no deliberate attempt on the part of the police to compromise the photo identification.&nbsp; He observed, however, that the recited flaws did tend to reduce the reliability of the identification evidence. Nonetheless, he took Mr. Adams’ evidence into account and concluded that the Appellant was the man that Mr. Adams saw sleeping in the hallway.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The Appellant was in possession of or had pawned a number of items said to be missing from the victim’s apartment.&nbsp; The evidence relied upon by the Crown to identify the property was equivocal.&nbsp; The victim’s wife was unable to positively identify the property.&nbsp; By way of illustration, she explained that a Fuji camera which she was asked to identify “could have been” in the victim’s office.&nbsp; Her difficulty was, as she put it, “I’m afraid all cameras look the same to me.”&nbsp; Her testimony regarding a video recorder was equally uncertain.&nbsp; She was only able to say that “[s]ometimes Dougald used to mark the backs.&nbsp; There is no way that I can say positively that this is the one but there was one similar in the bedroom.” (A.B. 239/10-12) Clothing said to have been in the victim’s car was found in the Appellant’s residence.&nbsp; The victim’s wife did identify some clothing as belonging to her and her husband, but it had earlier been loaded into their car with the intention of giving it to the Salvation Army.&nbsp; She could not say if that had been done.&nbsp; (A.B. 224/44 - 226/9) The victim's wife was asked to identify a number of cassettes said to belong to the victim.&nbsp; She could only say that her husband had a number of the same titles.&nbsp; (A.B. 238/4-41) The Appellant’s fingerprint was found on a jigsaw puzzle box which had been left unattended in the hallway of the building for about a week or two before this incident.&nbsp; (A.B. 22/28-41) No one could testify when the fingerprint came to be on the box, or how long it had been there.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Of critical importance, the position of the defence at trial was that the Appellant may have stolen the puzzle box, but was not the assailant.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

In the context of a civil case, Arbour J.A. (as she then was) aptly stated the following in <i>Crocker v. Sipus</i> (1992), 57 O.A.C. 310 (C.A.), at para. 15:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Its presence may be far more subtle and only discernible through the eyes of the person who keeps an open mind.&nbsp; It is in this sense that the trial judge who appears to have already committed to a verdict of guilt before completing the necessary analysis of the evidence may cause a reasonable person to apprehend that he or she has not kept an open mind.&nbsp; Further, if an appeal from the verdict has been launched, as here, and the reasons deal with certain issues raised on appeal, this may create the appearance that the trial judge is advocating a particular result rather than articulating the reasons that led him or her to the decision.</p>

(R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484.&nbsp; It encompasses the expectation that judges will strive to overcome personal bias and partiality and carry out the oath of their office to the best of their ability.&nbsp; Impartiality was described as follows by Cory J. (at paras. 104-5):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">. . . impartiality can be described — perhaps somewhat inexactly — as a state of mind in which the adjudicator is disinterested in the outcome, and is open to persuasion by the evidence and submissions.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The judge’s impartiality is essential to achieve trial fairness.</p>

While the trial judge’s reasons respond generally to the accused’s other arguments on appeal about whether there were grounds for a reasonable doubt or whether the verdicts were unreasonable, as noted by Hunt and Costigan JJ.A., given the nature of the case almost any reasons would have had this effect.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt"><u>been taken.</u>&nbsp; While ... the act of formulating reasons may further focus and concentrate the judge’s mind, and demands an additional effort of self-expression, the requirement of reasons as such is directed only to having the trial judge articulate <u>the thinking process that it is presumed has already</u> occurred in a fashion sufficient to satisfy the demand of appellate review.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
