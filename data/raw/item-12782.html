 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: &nbsp;The appeals should be dismissed.</span></p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is discovered at the appeal stage that information about prospective jurors which should have been disclosed at trial was not disclosed, persons who seek a new trial on the basis that this non‑disclosure of information deprived them of their s.&nbsp;7 <i>Charter</i> right to a fair trial must, at a minimum, establish that (1)&nbsp;the Crown failed to disclose information relevant to the selection process that it was obliged to disclose; and (2)&nbsp;had the requisite disclosure been made, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury would have been differently constituted.&nbsp; In addition to these two steps, in the event the jury would have been differently constituted, it may be that the Crown should then have the opportunity to show, on balance, that the jury was nonetheless impartial.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the appearance of unfairness, there must be conduct on the part of the Crown and the police, within and surrounding the jury selection process, that would constitute a serious interference with the administration of justice and offend the community’s sense of fair play and decency.&nbsp; When conduct of that nature is found to exist, it matters not that the accused may otherwise have had a fair trial; nor is it necessary to find that the accused may have been wrongfully convicted.&nbsp; It is the conduct itself that gives rise to a miscarriage of justice and demands that a new trial be ordered.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case at bar, the Court of Appeal acted as a court of first instance in respect of the jury vetting issue.&nbsp; In these circumstances, its findings, like those of a trial court, are entitled to deference.&nbsp; On the issue of trial fairness, there is no basis for interfering with the findings of the Court of Appeal on the impact — or the lack of impact — that the jury vetting practice had on the jury selection process.&nbsp; Although the Crown failed in its disclosure obligations, as found by the Court of Appeal, there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would have been differently constituted had the pertinent information obtained from the vetting process been disclosed.&nbsp; The appellants received a fair trial by an impartial jury.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the appearance of unfairness and the suggestion that the verdicts are the product of a miscarriage of justice, although aspects of the Crown’s conduct were improper and should not be repeated, what occurred here did not constitute a serious interference with the administration of justice, nor was it so offensive to the community’s sense of fair play and decency that the proceedings should be set aside as a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; The record checks were carried out in good faith and there was no attempt on the part of the police or the Crown to obtain a favourable jury.&nbsp; There is no basis for ordering a new trial.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[1]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These appeals require the Court to decide whether it is permissible for the Crown, in conjunction with the police, to conduct background checks on prospective jurors through the use of police databases — and if so, to what extent and for what purposes.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On December 22, 2005, following a nine-month trial before Stong J. of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and a jury, each of the appellants — Ibrahim Yumnu, Vinicio Cardoso, and Tung Chi Duong — was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">All three appellants appealed from their convictions to the Ontario Court of Appeal.&nbsp; Their appeals were heard together on April 6 and 7, 2009 and on February 1, 2010.&nbsp; At the proceedings in April 2009, the appellants raised grounds of appeal relating to the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury.&nbsp; At the end of the hearing on April 7, the court reserved its judgment. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Several months later, while the appeals remained under reserve, the appellants became aware of a “jury vetting” practice that the Crown Attorney’s office in Barrie, Ontario (the locale of the appellants’ trial) and police forces throughout the Judicial District of Simcoe County (the geographic area from which the jurors were selected) had apparently been following for some years.&nbsp; The vetting consisted of inquiries conducted by the police, at the behest of the Crown Attorney’s office, as to whether potential jurors had a criminal record or whether they were otherwise “disreputable persons” who would be undesirable jurors.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Once the widespread nature of this practice became known, inquiries were made and the appellants ordered transcripts of the jury selection process.&nbsp; The parties then produced a record, including affidavits upon which cross-examinations were conducted, and the appeals were reopened.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On February 1, 2010, the Court of Appeal heard arguments concerning the propriety of the vetting practice, including:&nbsp; its impact on the jury selection process and the composition of the jury; its impact on trial fairness; and, more broadly, its impact on the integrity of the criminal justice system and the administration of justice as a whole.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On October 5, 2010, the Court of Appeal (Weiler, Gillese and Watt JJ.A.) released comprehensive reasons for judgment dismissing all three appeals (2010 ONCA 637, 269 O.A.C. 48).&nbsp; Writing for the court, Watt J.A. concluded that certain features of the jury vetting process were inappropriate and should not be repeated.&nbsp; Other aspects were acceptable, subject to the Crown complying with its disclosure obligations.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In accordance with a concession from the Crown on appeal, Watt J.A. found that the Crown at trial had failed to disclose information obtained from the jury vetting process that might have assisted the appellants in the exercise of their peremptory challenges.&nbsp; In the end, however, he was not satisfied that the appellants suffered any prejudice from the Crown’s failure to meet its disclosure obligations.&nbsp; In his view, there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would have been differently constituted had disclosure been made; nor was there a basis for concluding that the Crown’s failure to disclose caused actual unfairness in the peremptory challenge process.&nbsp; Finally, it could not be said that the jury vetting practice created an appearance of unfairness that cast a pall over the entire proceeding.&nbsp; Accordingly, Watt J.A. rejected this ground of appeal.&nbsp; He also rejected the grounds relating to the alleged errors in the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Before this Court, the appellants no longer challenge the adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.&nbsp; Rather, the appeals centre on the jury vetting issue and the Court of Appeal’s treatment of it.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In a nutshell, the appellants complain that the jury vetting undertaken by the police, at the behest of the Crown, was highly improper.&nbsp; It compromised the integrity of the jury selection process and resulted in a jury that, if not favourably disposed to the Crown, might well have been differently composed had the appellants received the disclosure to which they were entitled. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On a more fundamental level, the appellants contend that the jury vetting conducted by the police, in conjunction with the Crown, strikes at the very heart of our criminal justice system and impinges on the sanctity of trial by jury that forms such a vital part of it.&nbsp; They say it raises the spectre of jury tampering and as such, it deserves this Court’s unqualified condemnation.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">One of the appellants equates what occurred here to the situation in </span><i><span style="line-height:200%">R. v. Latimer</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217,<i> </i></span><span style="line-height:200%">where the police, with the approval of the Crown, approached prospective jurors and asked them to complete a questionnaire setting out their views on a number of issues pertinent to the case.&nbsp; In <i>Latimer</i>, this Court found that the conduct of the Crown constituted a flagrant abuse of process and an interference with the administration of justice.&nbsp; This gave rise to an appearance of unfairness and necessitated a new trial.&nbsp; According to the appellants, the conduct of the police and the Crown in the present case led to an appearance of unfairness and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; Hence, they request a new trial.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">For the reasons that follow, I am unable to accede to the appellants’ arguments.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On the issue of trial fairness, I see no basis for interfering with the findings of the Court of Appeal on the impact — or more accurately, the lack of impact — that the jury vetting practice had on the jury selection process.&nbsp; The appellants received a fair trial by an impartial jury.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">As for the appearance of unfairness and the suggestion that the verdicts are the product of a miscarriage of justice, I readily acknowledge that aspects of the Crown’s conduct were improper and should not be repeated.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that what occurred here constituted a serious interference with the administration of justice, nor was it so offensive to the community’s sense of fair play and decency that the proceedings should be set aside as a miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">It follows, in my view, that there is no basis for ordering a new trial.&nbsp; I would accordingly dismiss the appeals.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The decision of the Court of Appeal is replete with detail and I see no need to replicate the court’s thorough review of the background facts, nor its comprehensive review of the jury selection process as a whole.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On December 13, 2004, prior to the commencement of the jury selection process, someone from the Court Services Branch of the Ministry of the Attorney General for Ontario provided a copy of the jury panel lists to the Crown Attorney’s office in Barrie.&nbsp; The person responsible for providing the lists failed to comply with s. 20 of the <i>Juries Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.3, which forbids disclosure of jury panel lists “until ten days before the sittings of the court for which the panel has been drafted”.&nbsp; The return date of the first panel in this case was set for January 24, 2005.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In choosing a jury, both Crown counsel and defence should have access to the same background information material.&nbsp; To that end, <u>results of criminal record checks of potential jurors, if obtained by Crown counsel, should be disclosed to defence counsel.&nbsp; Crown counsel should not request police to undertake any further or other investigation into the list of jurors.</u>&nbsp; Crown counsel should not request police to conduct out-of-court investigations into private aspects of potential jurors’ lives.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Any concrete information provided by police to Crown counsel suggesting that a prospective juror may not be impartial should be disclosed to the defence.</u>&nbsp; If background information relating to a prospective juror raises the issue of whether he/she is able to judge the case without bias, prejudice or partiality, Crown counsel should utilize the challenge for cause process to address these concerns.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

E.A.</i> (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), transcript of discussion on January 6, 1998 about jurors serving an intermittent sentence (respondent’s authorities, vol. II, Tab 43, at pp. 34-38)).<span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp; It is unclear whether the Crown in that case had proceeded by way of indictment so as to render the juror ineligible for jury duty under s. 4(b) of the <i>Juries Act </i>as it then read.&nbsp; Be that as it may, he had slipped through the cracks and the situation would have proved awkward, to say the least, if his sentencing obligations had prevented him from performing his jury duties.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">None of the information the Crown received about the prospective jurors was shared with the defence — at least not at the selection stage of the process.&nbsp; The record indicates that after the trial judge had excused a host of prospective jurors for reasons of personal hardship, and a challenge for cause on the basis of race had run its course, of the prospective jurors who remained in the pool at the peremptory stage of the proceedings, the Crown had information about 10 of them that it should have disclosed to the defence, but did not.&nbsp; Hence, the appellants entered the peremptory challenge phase of the process missing information that might have been useful in exercising their peremptory challenges.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">With respect to the 10 people in question, on my review of the record, of the three appellants before us, the appellant Yumnu is the only one who may have used a peremptory challenge that he might otherwise have saved had he received the disclosure to which he was entitled.&nbsp; That said, each of the appellants, including Mr. Yumnu, had one or more peremptory challenges remaining to him at the end of the selection process.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, the parties assembled a record for the Court of Appeal on the jury selection issue.&nbsp; On the basis of that record, the Court of Appeal made a number of findings that had a direct bearing on the outcome of the appeal.&nbsp; Those findings retain their importance at this stage and they are summarized below.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Issue 1: The Effect of Non-Disclosure on Trial Fairness</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the court reviewed the peremptory challenge phase of the process and determined that there was “no reasonable possibility that the jury would have been constituted differently had disclosure [of the pertinent information obtained from the vetting process] been made” (para. 122).&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">First, the court found that despite the scope of the Crown’s request in the December 14, 2004 memorandum, the purpose of the police inquiries was to determine whether a prospective juror had a criminal record.&nbsp; Second, the court found that in the circumstances, the impugned conduct did not reveal a colourable use of legitimate criminal record checks to obtain a favourable jury.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Those findings, which were open to the Court of Appeal to make, satisfy me that the record checks were carried out in good faith.&nbsp; There was no attempt on the part of the police or the Crown to uncover information about prospective jurors in an effort to obtain a favourable jury.&nbsp; In its December 14, 2004 memorandum to various police forces, the Crown should not have asked the police to go beyond criminal record checks and use their databases to provide “comments . . . concerning any disreputable persons we would not want as a juror” — although this may not have been clearly understood at the time, given that PM [2005] No. 17, the Practice Memorandum on juror background checks, had not been formalized and did not come into effect until March 31, 2006.&nbsp; Moreover, under the </span><i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i><span style="line-height:200%"> of the Law Society of Upper Canada and the <i>Code of Professional Conduct </i>of the Canadian Bar Association, inquiries made by the parties for the purpose of exercising a challenge for cause were not prohibited.&nbsp; Be that as it may, certainly there was no attempt by the investigating officer to hide the information he obtained from the record checks, be it criminal record information or information that went beyond that.&nbsp; The additional information was recorded in his notebook and was there for anyone to see, including the five defence counsel who received a copy of his notes six weeks into the trial.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The fact that the Crown and the police were acting in good faith is important — although not determinative — in assessing whether the conduct in question crossed the forbidden line.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">That brings me to the nature of the impugned information and the manner in which it was obtained. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I have explained that it was permissible for the police to conduct criminal record checks to determine if a prospective juror was eligible to serve as a juror under provincial law and/or was subject to being challenged for cause under s. 638(1)(<i>c</i>) of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; I have also pointed out that it can be very difficult to discover whether or not a particular person has a criminal record.&nbsp; The use of multiple police databases may be required to make the inquiry meaningful and, even then, certainty will not always be achieved.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In carrying out legitimate criminal record checks, the police are liable to happen upon information that could be relevant to the selection process.&nbsp; As discussed, where that occurs, the police need not turn a blind eye to it.&nbsp; Rather, they should bring it to the Crown’s attention and the Crown should disclose it to the defence.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In this case, the investigating officer came upon information of that kind while conducting individual prospective juror record checks.&nbsp; He made it available to the Crown, as he should have.&nbsp; The Crown went wrong in failing to disclose it to the defence prior to the commencement of the selection process.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">While the failure to disclose was serious, it was not done for improper reasons.&nbsp; And in the end, according to the findings of the Court of Appeal, it had no impact on the composition of the jury, nor did it affect the outcome of the trial or the overall fairness of the trial process.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In these circumstances, while the Crown should not have asked the police to use police databases to detect “disreputable persons”, and while it should have disclosed to the defence information it received that may have been relevant to the selection process, I am not persuaded that what occurred here constituted a serious interference with the administration of justice, nor was it so offensive to the community’s sense of fair play and decency that the proceedings should be set aside as a miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
