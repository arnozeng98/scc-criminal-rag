24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The RCMP were alleged to have violated the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i> by selling a large quantity of hashish to senior ‚Äúexecutives‚Äù in a drug trafficking organization as part of a reverse sting operation.&nbsp; The appellants, as purchasers, were charged with conspiracy to traffic in cannabis resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for that purpose.&nbsp; The trial judge found the appellants guilty as charged but, before sentencing, heard their motion for a stay of any further steps in the proceeding.&nbsp; The appellants argued that the reverse sting constituted illegal police conduct which ‚Äúshocks the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper administration of justice that it warrants judicial intervention‚Äù.&nbsp; The stay was refused by the courts below.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The effect of police illegality on an application for a stay of proceedings depends very much on the facts of a particular case.&nbsp; This case-by-case approach is dictated by the requirement to balance factors which are specific to each fact situation.&nbsp; Here, the RCMP acted in a manner facially prohibited by the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>.&nbsp; Their motive in doing so does not matter because, while motive may be relevant for some purposes, it is intent, not motive, that is an element of a full <i>mens rea</i> offence.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A police officer investigating a crime occupies a public office initially defined by the common law and subsequently set out in various statutes and is not acting as a government functionary or as an agent.&nbsp; Here, the only issue was the status of an RCMP officer in the course of a criminal investigation and in that regard the police are independent of the control of the executive government. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Even if the police could be considered agents of the Crown for some purposes, and even if the Crown itself were not bound by the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>, in this case the police stepped outside the lawful ambit of their agency, and whatever immunity was associated with that agency was lost.&nbsp; Parliament made it clear that the RCMP must act ‚Äúin accordance with the law‚Äù and that illegality by the RCMP is neither part of any valid public purpose nor necessarily ‚Äúincidental‚Äù to its achievement.&nbsp; If some form of public interest immunity is to be extended to the police to assist in the ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù, it should be left to Parliament to delineate the nature and scope of the immunity and the circumstances in which it is available.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Even if it should turn out here that the police acted contrary to the legal advice provided by the Department of Justice, there would still be no right to an automatic stay.&nbsp; The trial judge would still have to consider any other information or explanatory circumstances that emerge during the inquiry into whether the police or prosecutorial conduct ‚Äúshocks the conscience of the community‚Äù.&nbsp; A police force that chooses to operate outside the law is not the same thing as a police force that made an honest mistake on the basis of erroneous advice.&nbsp; There was no reason to think the RCMP ignored the advice it was given, but as the RCMP did make an issue of the legal advice it received in response to the stay applications, the appellants were entitled to have the bottom line of that advice corroborated.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The RCMP must be able to obtain professional legal advice in connection with criminal investigations without the chilling effect of potential disclosure of their confidences in subsequent proceedings. &nbsp;Here, the officer‚Äôs consultation with the Department of Justice lawyer fell squarely within this functional definition, and the fact that the lawyer worked for an ‚Äúin-house‚Äù government legal service did not affect the creation or character of the privilege.&nbsp; Whether or not solicitor-client privilege attaches in any of these situations depends on the nature of the relationship, the subject matter of the advice and the circumstances in which it is sought and rendered.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:

N-1, by selling a large quantity of hashish (cannabis resin) to senior ‚Äúexecutives‚Äù in a drug trafficking organization as part of what counsel called a ‚Äúreverse sting‚Äù operation.&nbsp; The appellants, as purchasers, were charged with conspiracy to traffic in cannabis resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for that purpose.&nbsp; The trial judge found the appellants guilty as charged but, before sentencing, heard the appellants‚Äô motion for a stay of any further steps in the proceeding.&nbsp; The appellants argued that the reverse sting constituted illegal police conduct which ‚Äúshocks the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper administration of justice that it warrants judicial intervention‚Äù (see <i>R. v. Power</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 615). &nbsp;The stay was refused by the courts below.</p>

Lore</i> (an unreported decision of Pinard&nbsp;J., March 8, 1991, No. 500-01-013926-891) which, in Cpl. Reynolds‚Äô view, gave implicit approval to a reverse sting operation in which police offered to sell narcotics to suspected drug traffickers.&nbsp; Cpl. Reynolds contacted Mr. James Leising, an experienced senior lawyer employed by the Department of Justice in Toronto, to obtain professional advice as to the legality of a reverse sting operation.&nbsp; Seven or eight meetings were held between Cpl. Reynolds and the Department of Justice lawyer in relation to the proposed operation.&nbsp; In September of 1991, approval by senior RCMP officers was given to initiate the reverse sting.&nbsp; Using the help of a police informant, the police contacted two groups of potential purchasers through the appellant Shirose.&nbsp; Negotiations with these groups included showing the hashish to prospective purchasers.&nbsp; However, the RCMP was careful not to provide any samples, despite requests to do so.&nbsp; The hashish remained under the control of the RCMP at all times.&nbsp; The appellant Campbell eventually participated in the negotiations as a financier for one of the two groups and in January 1992, the appellant Campbell, with the help of the appellant Shirose, agreed to pay $270,000 for 50 kilograms of cannabis resin.&nbsp; The retail value of these drugs at street level, as found by the trial judge, was close to $1&nbsp;million.&nbsp; Instead of receiving the expected 50 kilograms of cannabis resin in exchange for payment, however, the appellants were arrested and charged with conspiracy to traffic in cannabis resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking.</p>

(as he then was) pointed out that a stay of proceedings is not to be considered as a method of disciplining the police or the prosecution, but rather, that the Court is concerned with the larger issue of maintenance of public confidence in the judicial process.&nbsp; The trial judge noted that entrapment may be established where (a) the authorities provide an opportunity to persons to commit an offence without reasonable suspicion or acting <i>mala fides</i>, or (b) having a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a <i>bona fide</i> inquiry, they go beyond providing a mere opportunity and actually induce the commission of an offence.&nbsp; Caswell J. held that the police had acted with reasonable suspicion with respect to both appellants.&nbsp; She noted that the appellant Shirose had been involved in a search for a large-scale supplier of hashish long before the RCMP began its operation.&nbsp; She considered that the appellant Campbell volunteered himself&nbsp; ‚Äúout of the woodwork‚Äù and joined the conspiracy completely on his own initiative.&nbsp; As to the allegation that the RCMP had induced the commission of the offences, Caswell J. concluded, based on the criteria set out in <i>Mack</i>, that the police conduct had not induced the offence or otherwise gone beyond ‚Äúthe limits that society deems proper‚Äù.&nbsp; Accordingly, there was no entrapment on the facts of this case.&nbsp;</p>

Reynolds in this case, the ‚Äúexecutives‚Äù up the chain of command of large-scale drug organizations are able to insulate themselves from sting operations.&nbsp; The street level pushers apprehended by the police are easily sacrificed and easily replaced.&nbsp; For the purpose of more effective law enforcement, the police therefore devised what counsel referred to as ‚Äúreverse sting‚Äù operations whereby the police became vendors rather than purchasers, i.e., the roles of vendor and purchaser were reversed within the sting operation.&nbsp; Because of the amount and value of drugs involved, reverse sting operations brought the police ‚Äúvendors‚Äù into direct contact with the executive purchasers in the large drug organizations.&nbsp; It has proved to be an effective technique.&nbsp; It also, however, brought the police into conflict with the very law that they were attempting to enforce.&nbsp; Neither the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i> nor its regulations authorize the police to <u>sell</u> drugs.&nbsp; The appellants, as stated, purport to be shocked at the illegality of police conduct, and ask the Court to hold that the conduct so violates the community‚Äôs fundamental sense of decency and values that it should result in a stay of proceedings against them.&nbsp;</p>

Douglas</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 301, is fatal to this objection.&nbsp; After noting at pp. 315-16 that ‚Äú[w]hile the offence of conspiracy is inherently difficult to frame, the indictment must be set forth with such reasonable precision as to inform the accused of the fundamental nature of the conspiracy charged‚Äù.&nbsp; Cory J. nevertheless concluded, at p. 322, that:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It is not alleged that the RCMP conduct is such that it could be said to fall within one of the established ‚Äújustification‚Äù defences (e.g., self-defence or defence of third parties) and the Crown offers no authority for the proposition that there exists (or should exist) in Canada a so-called ‚Äúlaw enforcement‚Äù justification defence generally.&nbsp; The United States experience is mixed: see G. Greaney, ‚ÄúCrossing the Constitutional Line: Due Process and the Law Enforcement Justification‚Äù (1992), 67 <i>Notre Dame L. Rev.</i> 745.&nbsp; In any event, the author points out that the law justification defence ‚Äúonly applies if the ‚Äòconduct is within the reasonable exercise of the policeman‚Äôs duty ...‚Äô‚Äù (p. 784) and ‚Äú... courts also look to an officer‚Äôs adherence to state and federal laws when examining the reasonableness of the officer‚Äôs conduct‚Äù (p. 787).&nbsp; The law enforcement justification is frequently raised in the United States in the context of federal law enforcement activity that complies with federal laws but breaches state laws.&nbsp; In such cases, the United States Supreme Court held in <i>In re Neagle</i>, 135 U.S. 1 (1890), <i>per</i> Miller J., at p. 68 and following, that the officer claiming the law enforcement justification must be performing an act that <u>he or she is authorized by federal law to perform as part of police duties</u> and that actions in violation of state law must be carefully circumscribed so as to do no more than is necessary and proper.&nbsp; See <i>Baucom v. Martin</i>, 677 F.2d 1346 (11th Cir. 1982), <i>per</i> Wood J., at p. 1350.&nbsp; It would therefore appear that in the United States a police officer would not be entitled to the law enforcement justification where, as here, the constitutive statute of the police force imposes on its members the duty to act ‚Äúin accordance with the law‚Äù (<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-r-10-en#!fragment/sec37" target="_blank">Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-r-10-en#!fragment/sec37" target="_blank">, s. 37<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>).</p>

Reynolds satisfied the conditions precedent ‚Äúto the existence of the right of the lawyer‚Äôs client to confidentiality‚Äù (<i>Desc√¥teaux</i>,<i> supra</i>, p. 872).&nbsp; Subject to what is said below, when Mr. Leising of the Department of Justice initially advised Cpl. Reynolds about the legality of a reverse sting operation, these communications were protected by solicitor-client privilege.</p>

Reynolds and related documents, on the one hand, and the position taken by the Crown and the RCMP before the courts in this case, on the other hand.&nbsp; The testimony of Cpl. Reynolds was that he did not require legal advice ‚Äúto plan the venture‚Äù.&nbsp; He already knew about reverse sting operations.&nbsp; Nor did he seek the advice to ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù the crime.&nbsp; He sought advice as to whether or not the operation he had in mind was lawful.&nbsp; This is the sort of transaction advice sought every day from lawyers.&nbsp; In my view, the privilege is not automatically destroyed if the transaction turns out to be illegal.&nbsp; As noted above, Dickson J., in <i>Solosky</i>, at p. 835, referred to <i>R. v. Cox and Railton</i> (1884), 14 Q.B.D. 153, as ‚Äú[t]he classic case‚Äù on this point.&nbsp; In that case, a judgment debtor consulted a solicitor about the vulnerability of assets to seizure.&nbsp; The solicitor‚Äôs advice was essentially that it could not be done without a <i>bona fide</i> sale of the property in question.&nbsp; Later, when the judgment creditor attempted to realize against the assets, they had been sold.&nbsp; It was alleged that the sale was fraudulent as having been entered into in an attempt to deprive the judgment creditor of the fruits of his judgment.&nbsp; The solicitor was called as a witness and compelled to testify about the advice he had given.&nbsp; Stephen J., for the court on appeal, after affirming the importance of the solicitor-client privilege, went on to discuss the limits of this doctrine as follows, at p. 168:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Reynolds does not establish such things, but the formal position of the Crown, with the support of the RCMP, goes beyond his evidence.&nbsp; The RCMP position before the Court was that the decision to proceed with the reverse sting had been taken with the participation and agreement of the Department of Justice.&nbsp; By adopting this position, the RCMP belatedly brought itself within the ‚Äúfuture crimes‚Äù exception, and put in question the continued existence of its privilege.</p>

Reynolds as the client in these circumstances because even though he was exercising the duties of his public office as a police officer, Cpl. Reynolds was seeking the legal advice in the course of his RCMP employment.&nbsp; The identification of&nbsp; ‚Äúthe client‚Äù is a question of fact.&nbsp; There is no conceptual conflict between the individual responsibilities of the police officer and characterizing the ‚Äúclient‚Äù as the RCMP.&nbsp; Despite the existence of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-r-10-en" target="_blank">Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and related legislation, I believe the relationship among individual policemen engaged in criminal investigations is accurately set out in <i>Halsbury‚Äôs Laws of England</i> (4th ed. 1981), vol. 36, at p. 107:</p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The issue in this case is not the knowledge of the bank.&nbsp; <u>The issue is whether the bank was induced to take certain steps in reliance upon the advice from the receiver on legal matters.</u>&nbsp; To take one instance, the receiver, according to the bank, advised the bank that it was not necessary to allow Abacus [the plaintiff debtor] time for payment before the appointment of the receiver.&nbsp; A significant legal decision had been rendered some months earlier to the opposite of that advice.&nbsp; <u>The extent to which the bank had been advised about that decision, not merely of its result, is important</u> in the resolution of the issue whether the bank relied upon the advice of the receiver.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The Court goes on to adopt the reasoning of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in <i>United States v. Exxon Corp.</i>, 94 F.R.D. 246 (1981) as follows, at pp. 248-49:</p>

Reynolds about his knowledge of the law with respect to reverse sting operations ‚Äì he testified that he had read the Superior Court decision in <i>Lore</i>, <i>supra</i>, and was of the view that the operation in question was legal.&nbsp; But Cpl.&nbsp;Reynolds also testified, in answer to the appellants‚Äô counsel, that he sought out the opinion of Mr. Leising of the Department of Justice to verify the correctness of his own understanding.&nbsp; The appellants‚Äô counsel recognized that this alone was not enough to waive the privilege.&nbsp; Cpl. Reynolds was simply responding to questions crafted by the appellants, as he was required to do.&nbsp; Appellants‚Äô counsel accepted that he had no right at that point to access the communications.&nbsp; His comment to the judge was simply that ‚ÄúI certainly don‚Äôt want to hear the argument that ‚ÄòOh well, the police acted in good faith because they acted on legal advice‚Äô‚Äù.&nbsp; The critical point is that the Court <u>did</u> hear that precise argument from the Crown at a later date.&nbsp; The RCMP and its legal advisers were explicit in their factum in the Court of Appeal, where it was argued that ‚Äúregard <u>must</u> be had to the following considerations ... (f) The R.C.M.P. ... consulted with the Department of Justice with regard to any problems of illegality‚Äù (emphasis added).&nbsp; We understand that the same position was advanced to the trial judge.&nbsp; As <i>Rogers</i>, <i>supra</i>, shows, it is not always necessary for the client actually to disclose part of the contents of the advice in order to waive privilege to the relevant communications of which it forms a part.&nbsp; It was sufficient in this case for the RCMP to support its good faith argument by undisclosed advice from legal counsel in circumstances where, as here, the existence or non-existence of the asserted good faith depended on the content of that legal advice.&nbsp; The clear implication sought to be conveyed to the court by the RCMP was that Mr. Leising‚Äôs advice had assured the RCMP that the proposed reverse sting was legal.</p>
