Psychological detention is established either where the individual has a legal obligation to comply with a restrictive request or demand, or a reasonable person would conclude by reason of the state conduct that he or she had no choice but to comply.&nbsp; In cases where there is no physical restraint or legal obligation, it may not be clear whether a person has been detained. To determine whether the reasonable person in the individual’s circumstances would conclude that he or she had been deprived by the state of the liberty of choice, the court may consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the following factors:&nbsp; (a) the circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they would reasonably be perceived by the individual; (b) the nature of the police conduct; and (c) the particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual where relevant.&nbsp; To answer the question whether there is a detention involves a realistic appraisal of the entire interaction as it developed, not a minute parsing of words and movements.&nbsp; In those situations where the police may be uncertain whether their conduct is having a coercive effect on the individual, it is open to them to inform the subject in unambiguous terms that he or she is under no obligation to answer questions and is free to go.&nbsp; It is for the trial judge, applying the proper legal principles to the particular facts of the case, to determine whether the line has been crossed between police conduct that respects liberty and the individual’s right to choose, and conduct that does not.&nbsp; Deference is owed to the trial judge’s findings of fact, although application of the law to the facts is a question of law.&nbsp; [32] [43‑44]</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:200%">The Court’s embrace of a wholly claimant‑centred approach may lead to the impression that it is more important to enquire whether the hypothetical reasonable person “in the individual’s circumstances” would think himself or herself to be detained than whether he or she is detained.&nbsp; The perspective of the person stopped is important and it is true that there can be no detention unless the liberty of the person stopped is (or is reasonably perceived by that person to be) significantly constrained, but this does not exhaust the relevant considerations.&nbsp; [151]</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:200%">There are a number of problems with the Court’s continuing endorsement of the <i>Therens </i>approach for the purpose of determining when a simple interaction crystallizes into a detention. Insistence that the claimant’s circumstances be viewed from the more detached perspective of a “reasonable person” in some cases exaggerates the ability of ordinary people to stand up to police assertion of authority, and may compel the conclusion that the claimant had the choice to walk away whereas in reality no such choice existed.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the concept of the reasonable person is intended to describe average cooperative members of the public, the Canadian reality is that such people will almost always regard a direction from a police officer as a demand that must be complied with. Viewed in this way, police instructions or demands readily constrain a claimant’s choice to leave and, therefore, even the less intrusive encounters between the police and citizens ought frequently to be declared detentions under the claimant‑centred approach adopted by the majority.&nbsp; [166] [170]</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:200%">A further problem in calibrating the “reasonable person” is to define exactly what information this fictional person possesses and what experience he or she brings to the assessment of the encounter.&nbsp; This is of particular relevance to visible minorities who may, because of their background and experience, feel especially unable to disregard police directions, and feel that assertion of their right to walk away will itself be taken as evasive and subsequently argued by the police to be sufficient grounds of suspicion to justify a <i>Mann</i> detention.&nbsp; The police perspective on such encounters, whether or not conveyed to the person stopped, is relevant.&nbsp; In the absence of explicit criteria various judges will tend to read into the “reasonable person” their own projections of the moment at which, in their view, the person stopped ought to be able to call a lawyer. This may encourage a results‑oriented analysis.&nbsp; [169] [172‑174]</p>

Possession of such knowledge may in fact place the police in an adversarial relationship with the person approached whether that person is aware of the jeopardy or not. It is the adversarial relationship together with the “stop” that generates the need for counsel.&nbsp; On the other hand, a more benign police purpose may deprive even an unambiguous police command of the legal effect of a detention, and thereby enure to the benefit of the prosecution.&nbsp; [167] [178‑179]</p>

The police had no information whatsoever that the accused may have been implicated in criminal activity or even whether a crime had been committed.&nbsp; The police order to the accused to “keep his hands in front of him” crystallized the detention.&nbsp; However, the finding of a detention is properly the product not only of the accused’s perception (filtered through the hypothetical reasonable person) but also of the objective facts of why the encounter was initiated (crime detection) and the perception of the police, who at the outset lacked any information on which to base such aggressive tactics.&nbsp; The majority’s analysis under s.&nbsp;24(2) and the consequent disposition of the appeal are also agreed with.&nbsp; [181‑184]</p>

Two of the officers, Constables Worrell and Forde, were dressed in plainclothes and driving an unmarked car. Although on patrol, their primary task was to visit the various schools to determine if there were persons on school property who should not have been there — either non-students or students from another school. The third officer, Constable Gomes, was in uniform and driving a marked police car.&nbsp; On “directed patrol”, he had been tasked with maintaining a visible police presence in the area in order to provide student reassurance and to deter crime during the high school lunch period.</p>

Worrell decided that “maybe we should have a chat with this guy and see what’s up with him”.&nbsp; Cst. Worrell wanted to know whether Mr. Grant was a student at one of the schools they were assigned to monitor, and, if he was not, whether he was headed to one of the schools anyway.&nbsp; Noticing Cst. Gomes parked on the street ahead of Mr. Grant, and in light of his uniformed attire, the two plainclothes officers suggested to Cst.

On direct examination he said that “[h]e still seemed to be, I don’t know, looking a bit nervous the way he was looking around, looking at us, looking around when speaking to Officer Gomes. And at this time, I suggested to my partner, you know, I don’t think it would hurt if we just go up to Officer Gomes and just stand by, just to make sure everything was okay.” Thus, after a brief period observing the exchange from their car, the two officers approached the pair on the sidewalk, identified themselves to the appellant as police officers by flashing their badges, and took up positions behind Cst.

He concluded that a detention had crystallized during the conversation with Cst. Gomes, before the appellant made his incriminating statements. Because the officers had no reasonable grounds to detain the appellant, the detention was arbitrary and a breach of s. 9 was established. Laskin J.A. did not deal with s. 10(<i>b</i>) and found no breach of s. 8. On the question of exclusion under s. 24(2), Laskin J.A. determined that the firearm was “derivative” evidence emanating from a self-incriminatory statement and would very often be excluded on that basis alone. However, after a review of recent developments in the s. 24(2) jurisprudence, Laskin J.A. concluded that the admission of the gun would not unduly undermine trial fairness. He held that the repute of the administration of justice would be damaged more by the exclusion of the gun than by its admission. He therefore held that the gun was properly admitted into evidence. On the firearms issue, Laskin J.A. held that Mr. Grant’s act of moving the gun from one place to another fell within the definition of “transfer” in s. 84 of the <i>Code</i>, justifying the conviction under s. 100(1). He therefore dismissed the appeal: (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 1.</p>

The ambit of detention for constitutional purposes is informed by the need to safeguard this choice without impairing effective law enforcement.&nbsp; This explains why the extremes of formally asserted control on the one hand and a passing encounter on the other have been rejected; the former restricts detention in a way that denies the accused rights he or she needs and should have, while the latter would confer rights where they are neither necessary or appropriate.</p>

The first is where the subject is legally required to comply with a direction or demand, as in the case of a roadside breath sample. The second is where there is no legal obligation to comply with a restrictive or coercive demand, but a reasonable person in the subject’s position would feel so obligated. The rationale for this second form of psychological detention was explained by Le Dain J. in <i>Therens</i> as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

inter-ideograph;line-height:200%">In my opinion, it is not realistic, as a general rule, to regard compliance with a demand or direction by a police officer as truly voluntary, in the sense that the citizen feels that he or she has the choice to obey or not, even where there is in fact a lack of statutory or common law authority for the demand or direction and therefore an absence of criminal liability for failure to comply with it. Most citizens are not aware of the precise legal limits of police authority. Rather than risk the application of physical force or prosecution for wilful obstruction, the reasonable person is likely to err on the side of caution, assume lawful authority and comply with the demand. The element of psychological compulsion, in the form of a reasonable perception of suspension of freedom of choice, is enough to make <u>the restraint of liberty</u> involuntary. Detention may be effected without the application or threat of application of physical restraint if the person concerned <u>submits or acquiesces in the deprivation of liberty</u> and <u>reasonably believes that the choice to do otherwise does not exist</u>.

As held in <i>Therens</i>, this must be determined objectively, having regard to all the circumstances of the particular situation, including the conduct of the police.&nbsp; As discussed in more detail below and summarized at para. 44, the focus must be on the state conduct in the context of the surrounding legal and factual situation, and how that conduct would be perceived by a reasonable person in the situation as it develops.</p>

While the test is objective, the individual’s particular circumstances and perceptions at the time may be relevant in assessing the reasonableness of any perceived power imbalance between the individual and the police, and thus the reasonableness of any perception that he or she had no choice but to comply with the police directive.&nbsp; To answer the question whether there is a detention involves a realistic appraisal of the entire interaction as it developed, not a minute parsing of words and movements. In those situations where the police may be uncertain whether their conduct is having a coercive effect on the individual, it is open to them to inform the subject in unambiguous terms that he or she is under no obligation to answer questions and is free to go.&nbsp; It is for the trial judge, applying the proper legal principles to the particular facts of the case, to determine whether the line has been crossed between police conduct that respects liberty and the individual’s right to choose, and conduct that does not.</p>

Given the existence of such a generally understood right in such circumstances, a reasonable person would not conclude that his or her right to choose whether to cooperate with them has been taken away. This conclusion holds true even if the person may feel compelled to cooperate with the police out of a sense of moral or civic duty. The Ontario Court of Appeal adverted to this concept in <i>Grafe</i>, where Krever J.A. wrote, at p. 271:</p>

The police must be able to act in a manner that fosters this cooperation, not discourage it. However, police investigative powers are not without limits. The notion of psychological detention recognizes the reality that police tactics, even in the absence of exercising actual physical restraint, may be coercive enough to effectively remove the individual’s choice to walk away from the police. This creates the risk that the person may reasonably feel compelled to incriminate himself or herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where that is the case, the police are no longer entitled simply to expect cooperation from an individual. Unless, as stated earlier, the police inform the person that he or she is under no obligation to answer questions and is free to go, a detention may well crystallize and, when it does, the police must provide the subject with his or her s. 10(<i>b</i>) rights. That the obligation arises only on detention represents part of the balance between, on the one hand, the individual rights protected by ss. 9 and 10 and enjoyed by all members of society, and on the other, the collective interest of all members of society in the ability of the police to act on their behalf to investigate and prevent crime.</p>

Failure to effectively prosecute a serious charge due to excluded evidence may have an immediate impact on how people view the justice system.&nbsp; Yet, as discussed, it is the long-term repute of the justice system that is s. 24(2)’s focus. As pointed out in <i>Burlingham</i>, the goals furthered by s. 24(2) “operate independently of the type of crime for which the individual stands accused” (para. 51). And as Lamer J. observed in <i>Collins</i>, “[t]he <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>is designed to protect the accused from the majority, so the enforcement of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>must not be left to that majority” (p. 282).&nbsp; The short-term public clamour for a conviction in a particular case must not deafen the s. 24(2) judge to the longer-term repute of the administration of justice.&nbsp; Moreover, while the public has a heightened interest in seeing a determination on the merits where the offence charged is serious, it also has a vital interest in having a justice system that is above reproach, particularly where the penal stakes for the accused are high.</p>

Violation of these fundamental rights tends to militate in favour of excluding the statement.</p>

Equating them under the umbrella of conscription risks erasing relevant distinctions and compromising the ultimate analysis of systemic disrepute.&nbsp; As Professor Paciocco has observed, “in equating intimate bodily substances with testimony we are not so much reacting to the compelled participation of the accused as we are to the violation of the privacy and dignity of the person that obtaining such evidence involves” (“<i>Stillman</i>,<i> </i>Disproportion and the Fair Trial Dichotomy under Section 24(2)”, at p. 170).&nbsp; Nor does the taking of a bodily sample trench on the accused’s autonomy in the same way as may the unlawful taking of a statement. The pre-trial right to silence under s. 7, the right against testimonial self-incrimination in s. 11(<i>c</i>), and the right against subsequent use of self-incriminating evidence in s. 13 have informed the treatment of statements under s. 24(2).&nbsp; These concepts do not apply coherently to bodily samples, which are not communicative in nature, weakening self‑incrimination as the sole criterion for determining their admissibility.</p>

Shepherd</i>, 2007 SKCA 29, 218 C.C.C. (3d) 113 (<i>per </i>Smith J.A. dissenting), aff’d 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527 (released concurrently); and <i>R. v. Padavattan</i> (2007), 223 C.C.C. (3d) 221 (Ont. S.C.J.), <i>per</i> Ducharme J.&nbsp; Notably, breath sample evidence tendered on impaired driving charges has often suffered the fate of automatic exclusion even where the breach in question was minor and would not realistically bring the administration of justice into disrepute. More serious breaches in other kinds of cases — for instance, those involving seizures of illegal drugs in breach of s. 8 — have resulted in admission on the grounds that the evidence in question was non-conscriptive. This apparent incongruity has justifiably raised concern.</p>

The doctrine of “discoverability” has been developed in order to distinguish those cases in which the accused’s conscription was necessary to the collection of the evidence, from those cases where the evidence would have been obtained in any event. In the former cases, exclusion was the rule, while in the latter, admission was more likely.</p>

Stuart, “Questioning the Discoverability Doctrine in Section 24(2) Rulings” (1996), 48 C.R. (4th) 351; Hogg, at section 41.8(d). In practice, it has proved difficult to apply because of its hypothetical nature and because of the fine-grained distinctions between the tests for determining whether evidence is “derivative” and whether it is “discoverable”: see <i>Feeney</i>, at paras.&nbsp;69-71.</p>

The discoverability doctrine acquired even greater importance under <i>Stillman</i> where the category of conscriptive evidence was considerably enlarged.&nbsp; Since we have concluded that this underlying rationale should no longer hold and that “trial fairness” in the <i>Collins/Stillman</i> sense is no longer a determinative criterion for the s.&nbsp;24(2) inquiry, discoverability should likewise not be determinative of admissibility.</p>

Though we have concluded that the police were in error in detaining the appellant when they did, the mistake is an understandable one. Having been under a mistaken view that they had not detained the appellant, the officers’ failure to advise him of his right to counsel was similarly erroneous but understandable.

While police are not expected to engage in judicial reflection on conflicting precedents, they are rightly expected to know what the law is.</p>

These effects must be balanced in determining whether admitting the gun would put the administration of justice into disrepute.&nbsp; We agree with Laskin J.A. that this is a close case. The balancing mandated by s. 24(2) is qualitative in nature and therefore not capable of mathematical precision.&nbsp; However, weighing all these concerns, in our opinion the courts below did not err in concluding that the admission of the gun into evidence would not, on balance, bring the administration of justice into disrepute.&nbsp; The significant impact of the breach on Mr. Grant’s <i>Charter</i>-protected rights weighs strongly in favour of excluding the gun, while the public interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits weighs strongly in favour of its admission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the situation in <i>R. v. Harrison</i>, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, the police officers here were operating in circumstances of considerable legal uncertainty. In our view, this tips the balance in favour of admission, suggesting that the repute of the justice system would not suffer from allowing the gun to be admitted in evidence against the appellant.</p>

First, according to the “associated meaning” principle of statutory interpretation, “when two or more words linked by ‘and’ or ‘or’ serve an analogous grammatical and logical function within a provision, they should be interpreted with a view to their common features”: <i>McDiarmid Lumber Ltd. v. God’s Lake First Nation</i>, 2006 SCC 58, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 846, at para. 30, <i>per</i> McLachlin C.J. See also R. Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i> (5th ed. 2008), at pp.&nbsp;227-31. Once again, the definition of “transfer” is given in s. 84 as “sell, provide, barter, give, lend, rent, send, transport, ship, distribute or deliver”. Of these words, only “transport” can plausibly be said to include moving a thing from place to place without the thing actually changing hands.&nbsp; The common element is the notion of a <i>transaction</i>. This suggests a more restrictive meaning than indicated by the dictionary definition of “transport”.</p>

Even if “transfer” is equated with “transport”, the underlined words suggest that the import of the provision is to criminalize the transfer of firearms for purposes that implicate others. In other words, the inclusion of the phrase “whether or not for consideration” in s. 100(1)(<i>a</i>) suggests that Parliament did not intend to criminalize simple movement of firearms by this provision, but rather transport for purposes that implicate another person. Further, the criminalization of an “offer” to transfer a firearm under s. 100(1)(<i>b</i>) suggests that a “transfer” is transactional in nature.</p>

Moving a firearm in an unauthorized manner could result in prosecution under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec86subsec2" target="_blank">s. 86(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which penalizes the transportation of a firearm in contravention of the regulations made pursuant to the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1995-c-39-en" target="_blank">Firearms Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

As the Court held in <i>R. v. Davis</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 759, at para. 53, <i>per </i>Lamer C.J., headings “should be considered part of the legislation and should be read and relied on like any other contextual feature” (quoting R. Sullivan, <i>Driedger on the Construction of Statutes </i>(3rd ed. 1994), at p. 269).&nbsp; Firearms trafficking offences are extremely serious, carrying substantial penalties. Indeed, since amendments to the <i>Code</i> in 2008, a conviction under s. 100(1) now carries a mandatory minimum penitentiary sentence of three years for a first-time offender, up from one year when Mr. Grant was convicted. It should not be lightly assumed that Parliament intended to deem anyone moving a firearm from place to place without authorization to be a weapons trafficker, liable to at least three years’ imprisonment on a first offence. In our view, a contextual reading of the applicable provisions suggests the contrary. Mr. Grant’s offence was serious and potentially extremely dangerous, but on the evidence he did not commit the crime of trafficking.</p>

Beheler</i>, 463 U.S. 1121 (1983), at p. 1125; <i>Oregon v. Mathiason</i>, 429 U.S. 492 (1977), at p. 495. See also <i>Escobedo v. Illinois</i>, 378 U.S. 478 (1964), at pp. 490-91;<i> Miranda v.

Keohane</i>, 516 U.S. 99 (1995), at p. 112.&nbsp; Whether such a situation of formal restraint exists under U.S. law “depends on the <u>objective</u> circumstances of the interrogation, not on the <u>subjective</u> views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned”:&nbsp; <i>Stansbury v. California</i>, 511 U.S. 318 (1994), at p. 323 (emphasis added).&nbsp; In other words, in the U.S. psychological detention does not, without more, invoke entitlement to the assistance of counsel.&nbsp; The U.S. courts take a generous view of when “psychological detention” occurs because it triggers scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment of police conduct that would otherwise lie outside judicial oversight under their Constitution.&nbsp; In practical terms, the U.S. can live with such a broad claimant-centred definition because it does not have the effect of bringing in the lawyers at an early stage in encounters between the police and the citizen.&nbsp; The significant effect of a finding of detention in the U.S., as under our decision in <i>R. v. Mann</i>, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, is to require the police to meet the standard of reasonable suspicion.&nbsp; Thus, the <i>Mendenhall</i> doctrine of psychological detention, when imported into Canada, raises a complication under s. 10(<i>b</i>) not present in the United States.</p>

L.Q.</i> 434, at pp.&nbsp;444 and 452).&nbsp; In the latter sense, fairness is related to the concept of “conscriptive evidence”.&nbsp; Its purpose is to safeguard certain fundamental rights of the accused at trial, such as the right against self-incrimination.&nbsp; This interpretation is essentially the same as the one in <i>R. v. Stillman</i>, [1997] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 607.&nbsp; Finally, trial fairness has been defined very broadly by certain commentators and in certain judgments (see the dissent in <i>R. v. Burlingham</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, at para. 86).&nbsp; According to this approach, any use of evidence obtained in violation of constitutional rights is — regardless of the quality of the evidence (reliable, conscriptive, derivative, etc.) — a breach of trial fairness.&nbsp; It is clear that, although the concept of fairness seems to go hand in hand with any system of justice worthy of that name, it is not precise enough to serve as a reliable guide.</p>

T. Perrin et al., “If It’s Broken, Fix It: Moving Beyond the Exclusionary Rule — A New and Extensive Empirical Study of the Exclusionary Rule and a Call for a Civil Administrative Remedy to Partially Replace the Rule” (1998), 83 <i>Iowa L. Rev.</i> 669; W. R. LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment</i> (4th ed. 2004), vol. 1, at pp. 32‑37; <i>Herring v. United States</i>,<i> </i>555 U.S. 1 (2009); Law Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper 10, <i>Evidence — The Exclusion of Illegally Obtained Evidence</i> (1974), at pp.&nbsp;19‑20. The question has also been the subject of debate in Canada.&nbsp; According to Paciocco, at p.&nbsp;340, s.&nbsp;24(2) cannot have a deterrent effect, because it does not establish a clear and predictable rule requiring the exclusion of evidence.&nbsp; To other commentators, from the perspective of the conduct of state agents, exclusion is not an effective sanction.&nbsp; The police certainly have an interest in the conviction of an accused, but that interest is above all one of society as a whole.&nbsp; Administrative or disciplinary measures may have a greater deterrent effect on the police (Law Reform Commission, at pp.&nbsp;20‑22;<i> R. v. Duguay</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 93, at pp.&nbsp;123‑24, and <i>Burlingham</i>, at para.&nbsp;104, <i>per</i> L’Heureux‑Dubé&nbsp;J., dissenting).&nbsp; In my view, the reservations expressed regarding the effectiveness of the exclusion of evidence as a deterrent are an invitation to be very prudent as regards the importance attached to state conduct.</p>
