 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A jury found the accused guilty of second degree murder.&nbsp; In the middle of the night, he had intervened in an altercation that ended in the victim’s death.&nbsp; The evidence in the record showed that the accused was under the influence of “many emotions” when he acted:&nbsp; he was angry, mad, upset, “out of it”, scared, afraid, worried, trying to protect himself and reacting emotionally.&nbsp; At trial, the judge refused three requests by the defence that he put to the jury the defence of provocation raised by the accused.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal, in a majority judgment, affirmed that decision and dismissed the appeal.&nbsp; All three justices in the Court of Appeal agreed that the evidence was sufficient in respect of the objective element.&nbsp; Only the dissenting judge, however, considered the evidence to be equally capable of supporting the subjective element.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Held </i>(LeBel and Wagner&nbsp;JJ. dissenting):&nbsp; The appeal should be allowed.&nbsp; The verdict of guilty should be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>Fish, Moldaver and Karakatsanis&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; To the extent that the evidence adduced before him was reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the defence, the trial judge was bound to put the defence of provocation to the jury.&nbsp; The air of reality test is not intended to assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the day.&nbsp; The relevant question is whether the record contains a sufficient factual foundation for a properly instructed jury to give effect to the defence.&nbsp; In this case, a careful reading of the deposition of the accused ― in light of the evidence as a whole ― sufficiently supports the inferences necessary for the defence of provocation to apply.&nbsp; It was open to a properly instructed jury to resolve the question whether the accused had acted on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec232subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;232(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Furthermore, the trial judge is not at all in the best position to determine whether a defence has an air of reality, since that is a question of law.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per </i>LeBel and Wagner&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; The trial judge must put to the jury only those defences that have an air of reality and are capable of being accepted by the jury.&nbsp; There is no minimal air of reality test in Canadian law.&nbsp; A defence either has an air of reality or does not have one.&nbsp; To determine whether a defence meets the air of reality test, the trial judge must consider the totality of the evidence in the record.&nbsp; The defence of provocation has two elements:&nbsp; an objective element that presupposes the existence of a wrongful act or an insult that is sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control, and a subjective element that requires evidence establishing that the accused acted in response to the provocation, on the sudden and before there was time for his or her passion to cool.&nbsp; In this case, neither the objective element nor the subjective element of the defence of provocation met the air of reality test.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the objective element, the evidence established that when the accused stabbed the victim, he had come to his cousin’s defence and had helped push the victim back in circumstances such that the defence of provocation could no longer be relied on.&nbsp; The willing participation of the accused in the fight made it foreseeable that the victim would react as he did, and the accused could not claim that his acts were a response to a sudden, unexpected, spontaneous and unforeseeable situation.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the subjective element, there is no credible evidence in the record that the accused committed the murder in response to an act of provocation by the victim before his passion had cooled.&nbsp; On the contrary, the accused testified that he had acted knowingly, with full knowledge of what he was doing, to defend himself out of fear that the victim might recover his weapon and attack him.&nbsp; The only defence raised by the accused that had an air of reality in light of the evidence was self‑defence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the test of correctness is applied to the trial judge’s decision, an appellate court must bear in mind that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, is in the best position to determine whether the evidence that is capable of supporting the necessary inferences is credible.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>]&nbsp; To the extent that the victim’s conduct, as described by the appellant, meets, as Doyon&nbsp;J.A. explains, the requirements of the objective element of the defence of provocation, in my view the present circumstances also meet the requirements of the subjective element.&nbsp; It appears to me that we are dealing here with a very particular situation in which self‑defence (in this case, under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec34subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;34(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Cr.C<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</i>) and provocation are intertwined:&nbsp; the victim’s aggressive act was capable of causing a reaction which could conceivably arise in the context of either self‑defence or provocation.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming that it is believed, the appellant’s testimony as I understand it does not foreclose this dual theory, which has a sufficient (albeit minimal) air of reality to it, and I think it would be dangerous to parse his statements at this stage in order to determine whether his act stemmed from fear or uncontrollable anger, whether or not he had time to reflect, and whether or not he acted “on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool” (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec232subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;232(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Cr.C<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</i>).&nbsp; The trial judge should have put the defence of provocation to the jury and, after proper instruction, left the jury the task of deciding on the facts.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, this error warrants the ordering of a new trial.&nbsp; It cannot, in my view, be assumed ― as that would amount to usurping the function of the jury ― that had the jury been properly instructed on the defence of provocation, it would not have accepted that defence and would have arrived at the same verdict, rather than finding the appellant guilty of manslaughter.&nbsp; In other words, it cannot be said with any certainty that the jury, tasked with evaluating the evidence based on a legal framework comprising a charge of second degree murder, a defence of self‑defence and a defence of provocation (potentially carrying with it a verdict of manslaughter), would have arrived at the same verdict it rendered in a framework from which the defence of provocation had been excluded.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted; paras.&nbsp;104‑6.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is difficult to distinguish the instant case from <i>R. v. Gill</i>, 2009 ONCA 124, 241 C.C.C. (3d) 1, in which the Ontario Court of Appeal held:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in this case, the trial judge’s decision that there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation appears to be premised on two factors:&nbsp; first, the appellant’s evidence disavowing anger as the trigger for his actions, and second, a finding that there was no evidence of the appellant acting in the heat of passion or as a result of a loss of self control.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree that there will be some cases in which the appellant’s disavowal of one of the elements of a defence will preclude the availability of the defence based on the air of reality threshold.&nbsp; However, this is not one of those cases.&nbsp; In challenging the appellant’s evidence that he was afraid at the time he stabbed Mr.&nbsp;Garavellos, the Crown suggested, both in cross‑examination and in his closing address to the jury, that the appellant’s true emotion was anger.&nbsp; If the jury rejected the appellant’s evidence that he was afraid, there was evidence capable of supporting an inference that he was angry.&nbsp; [paras.&nbsp;18‑19]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is far from clear that Mr.&nbsp;Buzizi disavowed any of the essential elements of the defence of provocation.&nbsp; Even if certain excerpts from his testimony might leave the impression that he did, I am satisfied that a careful reading of his deposition ― in light of the evidence as a whole ― sufficiently supports the inferences necessary for his defence of provocation to apply.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, unlike <i>Gill</i>, it is common ground in this case that the appellant was under the influence of [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “many emotions” (A.R., at p.&nbsp;1864) when he acted.&nbsp; Moreover, the majority in the Court of Appeal recognized that [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “[t]he appellant was angry, mad, upset, ‘out of it’, scared, afraid, worried, trying to protect himself, reacting emotionally, according to the various expressions used” in the evidence in the record (para.&nbsp;41).&nbsp; The only disputed question is whether he “acted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool” within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec232subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;232(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;C‑46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.&nbsp; I agree with Bich&nbsp;J.A. that it was open to a properly instructed jury to resolve this dispute in the appellant’s favour.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, and again with respect, I find that my colleague errs — as did the trial judge — in his application of the “air of reality” test.&nbsp; As the Court held in <i>Cinous</i>, “the air of reality test [is not] intended to assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the day” (<i>R. v. Cinous</i>, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para.&nbsp;54).&nbsp; Rather, the relevant question is whether the record contains a sufficient factual foundation for a properly instructed jury to give effect to the defence.</p>

Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para.&nbsp;10, on the dangers of putting theoretically incompatible defences to a jury:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the particular defences in issue here — automatism and self‑defence — are, as the Crown suggested on the hearing of this appeal, incompatible in theory, though perhaps not always in practice.&nbsp; That is because self‑defence implies deliberate conduct that is at odds with the fundamental premise of automatism, a state of dissociative, involuntary conduct.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the following comments made by LeBel&nbsp;J. in his dissenting reasons in that case reflected the concerns voiced by Fish&nbsp;J. (at para.&nbsp;25):</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the instant case, counsel for the accused presented a defence of automatism, with all its strengths and weaknesses, to the court of assize.&nbsp; At the beginning of the trial, counsel had indicated that he also intended to argue self‑defence, but he said no more about this.&nbsp; The trial judge nevertheless put that defence to the jury on his own initiative.&nbsp; He decided to do so even though, as Nuss&nbsp;J.A. found, the available evidence did not lend even an “air of reality” to some of the principal elements of that very particular defence.&nbsp; Moreover, the judge undeniably misdirected the jurors regarding the defence.&nbsp; All he did, in essence, was tell them that they had to acquit the accused if they believed her.&nbsp; He said nothing about the subjective and objective aspects of the defence.&nbsp; Self‑defence was thus submitted to the jurors, without the necessary factual basis and after inadequate instructions had been given, together with the defence of automatism.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In circumstances such as these, a trial judge who must decide whether to put defences to a jury that appear at first glance to be incompatible must exercise caution and make sure that each of them has the common denominator of every successful defence — an air of reality — that will ultimately make it possible to determine which defences are available to the accused.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be helpful to reiterate the reasons why defences that do not meet the air of reality test should be excluded.&nbsp; The cardinal rule was explained in <i>R. v. Cinous</i>, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para.&nbsp;50:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle that a defence should be put to a jury if and only if there is an evidential foundation for it has long been recognized by the common law.&nbsp; This venerable rule reflects the practical concern that allowing a defence to go to the jury in the absence of an evidential foundation would invite verdicts not supported by the evidence, <u>serving only to confuse the jury and get in the way of a fair trial and true verdict</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be recalled that the appellant did not raise the defence of provocation at trial but relied on self‑defence.&nbsp; It may be observed here that at no time did the appellant say that he had been provoked into violent action by the words and conduct of the deceased.&nbsp; In fact, his description of events goes far to negate any suggestion of provocation.&nbsp; His evidence reveals an attack, described clearly and with some detail, to which he reacted, not on the sudden, but by defending himself.&nbsp; When, according to his evidence, he saw the deceased put his hand inside his sweater, he considered that the deceased was reaching for a gun and, in fear of his life, he shot and killed him.&nbsp; This describes a calculated and rational series of defensive acts, not a sudden reaction in the heat of passion.&nbsp; [p.&nbsp;1022]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of this unease related to the weakness of the evidence, even if the test of correctness is applied to the trial judge’s decision, an appellate court must bear in mind that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, is in the best position to determine whether the evidence that is capable of supporting the necessary inferences is credible.&nbsp; This is especially true in a case such as the one at bar in which it is considered necessary to mention that the air of reality of the defence is minimal.</p>
