(dissenting):&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary inquiry judge did not commit a jurisdictional error.&nbsp; There is no reason to believe in this case that she failed to consider “the whole of the evidence”.&nbsp; Although the judge did not mention the circumstantial evidence in her reasons, what is required is that her reasons indicate she understood the nature of the case so that the parties recognize that the case they argued was the one decided.&nbsp; The teacher’s evidence was the focus of the arguments of both the Crown and the defence, and the main issue was whether the knife was made of metal.&nbsp; Inferences from the subsequent conduct of the accused were secondary.&nbsp; A preliminary hearing judge ought not to be reversed simply because the reasons do not advert to all of the secondary or collateral circumstances that the Crown now say had a bearing on the main issue.&nbsp; The Crown did not demonstrate that the preliminary inquiry judge likely overlooked the circumstantial evidence. </span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Fish&nbsp;J. (dissenting):&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary inquiry justice’s omission to mention explicitly in her reasons certain elements of circumstantial evidence or to include a generalized assertion that she had considered all of the evidence does not indicate that she in fact failed to consider all of the evidence before discharging the accused.&nbsp; First, it cannot be assumed from the justice’s silence that she did not consider the circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; It is more plausible to infer that she&nbsp; simply found that the evidence she did not mention had no significant probative value, since it could not support a rational conclusion that the handle of the knife was made of metal — the critical issue in the case.&nbsp; Even if she was mistaken, her error would relate to the sufficiency of the evidence and would not constitute a jurisdictional error giving rise to <i>certiorari.</i>&nbsp; Second, there is some indication in her reasons that she did assess the circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; While the preliminary inquiry justice focussed her attention on the teacher’s evidence, she also adverted to the Crown’s submissions regarding reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record.&nbsp; Third, since the Crown, in its submissions relating to the composition of the weapon, referred the justice exclusively to the teacher’s testimony — its strongest and most significant evidence&nbsp;— it is not surprising that the justice did the same in her reasons.&nbsp; Fourth, the inquiry was neither disjointed nor hurried and the disposition was not reached precipitously or without reflection.&nbsp; In their submissions, both counsel drew the justice’s attention to the circumstantial evidence, including the accused’s “subsequent conduct”.&nbsp; A reviewing court should not assume that the evidence vanished overnight from the justice’s realm of contemplation.&nbsp; This is especially so where the justice amply demonstrated that she understood and considered all of the relevant issues.&nbsp; She was also perfectly aware of the limited nature of her task and of the test she was to apply in discharging it.&nbsp; There is no basis to assume that the preliminary inquiry justice did not apply the principles she had so carefully set out.&nbsp; </span></p>

Arcuri</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, 2001 SCC 54, at para. 30.&nbsp; As the preliminary inquiry judge correctly stated in this appeal:&nbsp; “Assessing the quality and reliability of the evidence, or weighing the evidence for competing inferences in determining whether there is sufficient evidence for committal is not permitted at this stage of the proceedings.”</p>

Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, 2002 SCC 26, we confirmed the duty on trial judges to give reasons adequate for the function they perform, including appellate review, but we also held in <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">Not every knife is a prohibited weapon.&nbsp; Section 84(1) of the <i>Code</i> defines a “prohibited weapon” as “(<i>b</i>) any weapon, other than a firearm, that is prescribed to be a prohibited weapon”.&nbsp; Those weapons prescribed to be&nbsp; prohibited are listed in Regulation SOR/98-462.&nbsp; In this case the relevant provision of the Regulation is part 3, section 15, which prescribes as prohibited “[t]he device known as ‘Brass Knuckles’ and any similar device consisting of a <i>band of metal</i> with one or more finger holes designed to fit over the fingers of the hand”.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The Crown’s argument here is that under the “parity” principle of <i>Dubois</i>, if a preliminary judge’s error as to the elements of a crime is unreviewable when challenged by the Crown (as the Crown contends is the law under <i>Tremblay</i>), that kind of error must also be unreviewable when challenged by the accused.&nbsp; The Crown argues that “the availability of <i>certiorari </i>does not turn on the identity of the party seeking that relief, but rather on the nature of the alleged error”.&nbsp; I find nothing objectionable in that assertion, but I cannot see how it warrants the conclusion that the alleged error in this case is unreviewable on <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; The fault lies in the Crown’s characterization of the error as “an alleged misinterpretation of the elements of the offence”.&nbsp; When characterized this way, it is indeed difficult to see how it can be that the accused can challenge such an error though the Crown cannot.&nbsp; The logic becomes clear, however, once the rule is framed, as it should be, in terms of the jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge:&nbsp; whether the error is challenged by the Crown or by the accused, an error is reviewable on <i>certiorari</i> only if it is jurisdictional.&nbsp; If it is not jurisdictional, no recourse to <i>certiorari</i> may be had.&nbsp; It is not the fact that it is the accused seeking <i>certiorari</i> here that makes the error reviewable.&nbsp; It is the fact that the error is jurisdictional.</p>
