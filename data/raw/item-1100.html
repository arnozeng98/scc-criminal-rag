The King</i> (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332 (S.C.C.), the appellant was accused of manslaughter.&nbsp; This Court held, at pp. 332-33, that the trial judge did not properly charge the jury with respect to the fact that the appellant did not stop to give aid to the individuals who had been injured:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Clark J. held that the third inference could not be drawn.&nbsp; Since the accused knew that he was wanted for a robbery committed in Pennsylvania, the possibility existed that he fled solely out of consciousness of guilt with respect to it, rather than the Florida robbery.&nbsp; To be useful, flight must give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt in regard to a specific offence.</span></p>
