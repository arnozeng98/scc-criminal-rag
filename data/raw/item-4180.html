line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the first ground, I conclude that the trial judge did not err in his instructions on how to assess the credibility of the unsavoury witness, David Miranda.&nbsp; The trial judge gave the jury a strong caution against relying on this witness’s testimony without independent confirmation, in accordance with the principles set out in <i>Vetrovec v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811.&nbsp; The most important aspects of Miranda’s testimony were inculpatory statements allegedly made to him by each appellant.&nbsp; The trial judge therefore properly suggested that the jury look to independent evidence for confirmation of Miranda’s testimony about these statements.&nbsp; He then highlighted for the jury certain aspects of the witness’s testimony for which there was potentially confirmatory or contradictory evidence.&nbsp; At no point did the trial judge tell the jury that they could use the statements of Hugo to confirm Miranda’s evidence on matters involving Miguel, or vice versa.&nbsp; To the contrary, he repeatedly instructed the jury not to use the statements of one appellant against the other.&nbsp; In the circumstances, the appellants’ reliance on this Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Perciballi</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 761, 2002 SCC 51,&nbsp; is misguided, and their argument was properly dismissed in the court below.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second ground of appeal raises the question whether, when faced with statements by an accused containing both inculpatory and exculpatory elements, a trial judge may, or should, instruct the jury that the incriminating parts are likely to be true “otherwise why say them?”, whereas excuses for one’s behaviour do not necessarily carry the same weight.&nbsp; This “mixed statement” instruction originates from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Duncan </i>(1981), 73 Cr. App. R. 359, and, for this reason, it is often referred to as “the <i>Duncan</i> instruction”.&nbsp; As I will explain, I conclude that it is dangerous to instruct the jury in a manner which suggests that inculpatory statements should be given more weight than exculpatory statements and, consequently, that it is best to avoid instructing the jury in this manner.</p>

Whether the instruction constitutes reversible error is a matter to be determined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the charge as a whole and the evidence at trial.&nbsp; In this case, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the instruction, when considered in context, did not constitute a misdirection.</p>

Perciballi </i>(2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 346, whose reasoning was substantially adopted on appeal to this Court ([2002] 2 S.C.R. 761, 2002 SCC 51).</p>

20.85pt;line-height:200%">Counsel likened this aspect of the charge to instructions given to a jury in the Ontario case of <i>R. v. Perciballi</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . In <i>Perciballi</i> it was alleged that a co‑accused, Antonio Portante, had placed one of two diversionary calls to the police to facilitate an armoured car robbery. The only evidence against Antonio Portante was a witness who placed him in a restaurant near the pay telephone from which the call was placed, and the evidence of an accomplice, DeFrancesca, who testified that he placed the other of the two calls. Portante’s brother, Angelo, another co‑accused, made an out‑of‑court statement that Antonio Portante had placed one of the two calls. The statement made by Angelo Portante was admissible against him to show that he, Angelo Portante, was aware of details of the plot. It was not admissible against Antonio Portante. Against Antonio Portante it was merely hearsay. Nonetheless the trial judge permitted the Crown to argue to the jury that the statement of Angelo Portante confirmed the evidence of DeFrancesco. The Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the conviction of Antonio Portante holding that the effect of this use of the evidence was to indirectly achieve what the Crown could not do directly, that is, to permit the jury to use the Angelo Portante statement against Antonio Portante. Counsel for Miguel Rojas says that this parallels what has happened in the case at bar with Hugo Rojas’ statement.</p>

20.85pt">With respect, I am of the view that what was at stake in each of the two cases is quite different. In <i>Perciballi</i> the trial judge permitted the jury to use the out‑of‑court statement of the co‑accused as confirmation that the testimony of the accomplice against the accused was true. The opposite occurred in the case at bar — the jury was told that there was evidence in the case against Hugo Rojas that tended to confirm David Miranda’s testimony that Hugo Rojas made certain out‑of‑court statements to him.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>I agree with Ryan J.A.’s analysis on this point.&nbsp; It is true that the underlying logic to the majority judgment in <i>Perciballi</i> could arguably be extended so as to require a parsing of a single witness’s credibility in the manner advocated by the appellants in this case.&nbsp; In other words, in deciding whether Miranda was telling the truth about the alleged statements made by Miguel, the jury would have to discount the fact that his overall credibility may have been bolstered by the evidence that confirmed the truth of his testimony concerning Hugo’s statements, and vice versa.&nbsp; Indeed, Doherty J.A. argued eloquently in his dissenting reasons in <i>Perciballi</i> that if pushed to its limits, the majority’s ruling would have that precise effect.&nbsp; I remain unpersuaded that the principle in <i>Perciballi</i> leads inevitably to this result.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In my respectful view, it is one thing for a jury to be expressly directed, as was done in <i>Perciballi</i>, to consider an out-of-court statement admissible only as against one accused in reaching its decision concerning the other.&nbsp; Such a direction would result in an impermissible use of the out-of-court statement.&nbsp; It is quite another matter, however, for the jury’s assessment of the overall credibility of the witness to be influenced in some way by the totality of the evidence that they have heard, including evidence relating solely to one co-accused.&nbsp; The latter is inevitable, given the intangible nature of any credibility assessment.&nbsp; Although the analogy is not perfect, we may view the matter in this way.&nbsp; It is well established that it is improper for the Crown or the judge to expressly comment on the accused’s failure to testify.&nbsp; Such a comment could compromise the accused’s right to silence and run afoul of the presumption of innocence.&nbsp; Yet, this does not mean that the accused’s silence at his trial is irrelevant.&nbsp; On the contrary, an accused’s failure to testify may well impact on a jury’s overall assessment of the Crown’s case and the credibility of any witnesses whose testimony stands uncontradicted.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>The British Columbia Court of Appeal recently considered a <i>Duncan</i>-type instruction in <i>R. v. David </i>(2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 64, 2006 BCCA 412, a decision released shortly after the hearing of this appeal in the court below.&nbsp; Counsel for Miguel Rojas advised this Court that following the decision in <i>David</i>, the Court of Appeal agreed to receive additional submissions from counsel on the impact of <i>David</i> on the case at bar.&nbsp; After receiving the submissions, the Court of Appeal advised that it would issue no further comment.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Ryan J.A., writing for the court in <i>David</i>, reviewed the divergent appellate decisions on the mixed statement instruction and concluded that while none of them were determinative of the question that occupied the court, “lessons [could] be taken from <i>Harrison</i>, <i>Rojas</i> and <i>Samuels</i>” (para. 42).&nbsp; She explained as follows (at para. 42):</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
200%">While an appeal court will look at each case to determine whether a like charge has led to an unfair trial, it is dangerous for a trial judge to instruct a jury that inculpatory and exculpatory statements ought to be weighed differently.&nbsp; Trial judges should leave such “common sense” arguments to the lawyers in their closing addresses.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="Section21"> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">In <i>David</i>, having regard to the wording of the instruction and its context, the court concluded that “what otherwise might have been a suggestion as to how the jury could approach the weighing of the evidence” was effectively transformed “to a rule of law that they were obliged to apply” (para. 44). The court therefore gave effect to this ground of appeal in <i>David </i>and ordered a new trial.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[35]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>As we can see, the <i>Duncan</i> instruction is rooted in basic evidentiary rules concerning the admission of out-of-court statements.&nbsp; As the court put it: “What a person says out of court is, generally speaking, not admissible to prove the truth of what he says” (p. 363).&nbsp; This general exclusionary rule applies in regard to both inculpatory and exculpatory statements.&nbsp; Confessions, however,&nbsp; fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, and the very rationale for the admissibility of admissions by an accused is that admissions against interest are likely to be true.&nbsp; As Cory J. stated in <i>R. v. Hodgson</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at para. 17:</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
200%">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the basis for the admission of a statement of the accused as an exception to the rule against hearsay is that what people freely say which is contrary to their interest is probably true.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Exculpatory out-of-court statements made by an accused are also subject to the general exclusionary rule against hearsay.&nbsp; Where the accused testifies, such statements are generally inadmissible because they are viewed as self-serving and lacking in probative value.&nbsp; Where the accused does not testify, there is an additional rationale for excluding such statements.&nbsp; McIntyre J. explained it in <i>R. v. Simpson</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3, as follows (at p. 22):</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
  </div> 
  <span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span> 
  <div class="Section22"> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:200%">As a general rule, the statements of an accused person made outside court — subject to a finding of voluntariness where the statement is made to one in authority — are receivable in evidence against him but not for him.&nbsp; This rule is based on the sound proposition that an accused person should not be free to make an unsworn statement and compel its admission into evidence through other witnesses and thus put his defence before the jury without being put on oath and being subjected, as well, to cross‑examination.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Of course, the general rule that excludes out-of-court exculpatory statements is not without exceptions.&nbsp; One such exception is relevant here — the mixed statement exception.&nbsp; Just as in England, it has long been established that where the Crown seeks to tender an accused’s out‑of-court statement which contains both inculpatory and exculpatory parts, it must tender the entire statement, and the exculpatory portions are substantively admissible in favour of the accused: <i>&nbsp;R. v. Hughes</i>, [1942] S.C.R. 517, at p. 521.&nbsp; Fairness to the accused is the obvious rationale for the mixed statement exception.&nbsp; The exception is also based on the more pragmatic consideration that it is often difficult to determine which parts of a statement are inculpatory and which parts are exculpatory.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In recognizing both the basis for admitting inculpatory statements and the exceptional admissibility of an accused’s untested statements, the <i>Duncan </i>instruction, as such, accurately reflects the state of the law.&nbsp; In England, the instruction is also perceived as achieving the “right balance”, as the House of Lords explained in <i>Aziz</i> (at p. 485):</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
200%">Moreover, I would reject the suggestion that the law as stated in <i>Sharp</i> is unduly balanced in favour of the defendants who do not testify.&nbsp; On the contrary, as was emphasised in <i>Duncan</i> and <i>Sharp</i>, a judge is entitled to comment adversely on the quality of the exculpatory parts of a mixed statement which has not been tested by cross‑examination.&nbsp; <u>The right balance has been found.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="Section23"> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">Judges in Canada, as in England, are also entitled to comment on the evidence so long as they make it clear that factual issues are for the jury to decide:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Gunning</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 627, 2005 SCC 27, at para. 27.&nbsp; The Crown therefore urges this Court to adopt the <i>Duncan </i>instruction in Canada.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>With respect to the contrary position adopted by our English colleagues, I would not accede to the Crown’s argument.&nbsp; In certain circumstances, it may be useful to explain to the jury why the law permits them to hear a particular piece of evidence where such instruction will assist them with their task.&nbsp; This may be the case, for example, where evidence is admitted for a limited purpose only.&nbsp; The jury may be more likely to comply with the limiting instruction if they understand the underlying rationale for the rule.&nbsp; In most circumstances, however, expounding the rationale for an evidentiary rule may only serve to confuse the jury unnecessarily or risk encroaching unduly upon their role as fact finders.&nbsp; For example, I can think of no principled reason to explain to a jury that they are hearing the accused’s confession because the court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was voluntarily made.&nbsp; Likewise, it would only risk encroaching unduly on the jury’s domain to tell them that they are hearing a piece of similar fact evidence because, in the judge’s view, the similarities with the offence are such that they “defy coincidence”.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[40]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In the same way, I see little advantage in expounding for the jury the underlying rationale for the mixed statement exception.&nbsp; If only for the pragmatic reason that it is often very difficult to differentiate between admissions and excuses, I too conclude, as did Ryan J.A. in <i>David</i> and in the court below, that it is dangerous for the judge to instruct the jury in a manner that suggests that inculpatory and exculpatory statements ought to be weighed differently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such “common sense” comments are better left to the advocacy of counsel (<i>David</i>, at para. 42).&nbsp; Therefore, I conclude that the <i>Duncan</i> instruction should not be adopted by Canadian trial courts.&nbsp; </p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[41]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>The question whether a <i>Duncan</i>-type instruction has resulted in an unfair trial in any given case, however, will depend entirely on the particular words used and their context.&nbsp; For example, as the finding of the court in <i>David</i> exemplifies, where the instruction is couched in terms of a legal presumption, the prejudicial effect may be difficult to overcome.&nbsp; In this case, as I will explain, having regard to the permissive wording of the impugned instruction, the charge as a whole and the nature of the statements at issue, it is my view that the instruction was more unfortunate than fatal.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>First, the trial judge instructed the jury that any statement made by an accused person is only evidence against the accused person who made it, unless it was made in the presence of the other accused person who can be said by his silence to have adopted the statement as his own.&nbsp; Second, he told the jury that they could not consider any alleged out-of-court incriminating statement unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made by the accused.&nbsp; Third, the jury was told that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made, they must then determine whether the statement was true.&nbsp; (I pause to note that instructions two and three can be problematic because it will often prove difficult to differentiate between inculpatory and exculpatory statements.&nbsp; If these instructions are given, it becomes important to dispel any notion that exculpatory statements need be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before they can be considered by the jury. This difficulty can be avoided altogether if the jury is instructed on the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt solely in respect of the elements of the offence and the ultimate verdict, and not in respect of particular items of evidence: <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.)</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:200%"><u>Since some of the alleged statements of each accused contain exculpatory statements or denials which tend to exonerate them, you must consider that, in the ordinary course of human behaviour, it often occurs that statements of an incriminating nature such as admissions or confessions are likely to be true, otherwise why say them.</u>&nbsp; On the other hand, excuses for one’s own behaviour do not necessarily carry the same persuasive weight.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a denial or other exculpatory statement may raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; That is so because any statement or part of a statement allegedly made by an accused that is exculpatory, in the sense that it denies that he committed the offence, or provides an innocent explanation, is evidence in favour of that accused, and you need not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he said it or that the denial or his explanation is true.&nbsp; If the evidence indicates that the accused Hugo Rojas or Miguel Rojas could reasonably have made the exculpatory statement and it is reasonable to believe that the exculpatory statement could be true, then it may raise a reasonable doubt in your mind in favour of Hugo Rojas or Miguel Rojas, or both.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; A.R., at pp. 572-73.]</p>
