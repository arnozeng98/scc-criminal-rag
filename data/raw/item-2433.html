   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Respondent, an investigative journalist, was denied access to search warrants and supporting material by appellant Grainger, the Justice of the Peace who had issued them, because such material was not available for inspection by the general public. At trial, respondent was held entitled to a declaration that search warrants after their execution, and the informations related to them in the control of the justice of the peace or court official, were court records available for examination by members of the general public. In dismissing an appeal, the Appeal Court declared that the public was entitled to inspect informations upon which search warrants were issued pursuant to s. 443 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>and that any member of the public, including individuals</span></p>

   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Laskin C.J. and Dickson, McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: After a search warrant has been executed, and objects found during the search are brought before a justice, members of the public are entitled to inspect the warrant, and the information upon which it was issued. Curtailment of public accessibility is justified only where the need to protect other social values is of superordinate importance. In cases where a search warrant is issued but nothing is found, protection of the innocent is such an overriding social value. Furthermore, the public interest in the effective administration of justice must override public accessibility to the extent that the proceedings at which the warrant is issued can be conducted <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">in camera. </span></i>Otherwise a person whose property was to be searched could remove the goods. The need for confidentiality disappears, however, once the warrant has been executed. At this point the public as well as those who are directly interested have a right to inspect the warrant and the related information.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">(dissent</span></i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">ing): </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">The broad declaration of the Court of Appeal, for reasons given by Dickson J., cannot be sustained. Respondent cannot assert a right to examine the search warrants and related informations on the basis that the issuance of the search warrants was a judicial act in open court with a right for the public to be present.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Proceedings before a justice under s. 443 are part and parcel of criminal investigative procedure and are not analogous to trial proceedings which are generally required to be conducted in open court. The opening to public inspection of the documents before the justice is not equivalent to the right of the public to attend and witness proceedings in court. Access to these documents should be restricted to persons who can show a direct and tangible interest in the documents. There is no general right to inspect search warrants and the informations relating thereto.</span></p>

In the latter capacity he had occasion to issue certain search warrants. The respondent, Linden MacIntyre, is a television journalist</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">employed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. At the material time Mr. MacIntyre was researching a story on political patronage and fund raising. Mr. MacIntyre asked Mr. Grainger to show him the search warrants and supporting material. Mr. Grainger refused, on the ground that such material was not available for inspection by the general public. Mr. MacIntyre commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Trial Division, for an order that search warrants and informations relating thereto, issued pursuant to s. 443 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, or other related or similar statutes, are a matter of public record and may be inspected by a member of the public upon reasonable request.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Mr. Justice Richard of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia delivered reasons approving Mr. Maclntyre's application. He held that Mr. MacIntyre was entitled to a declaration to the effect that search warrants "which have been executed", and informations relating thereto, which are in the control of the justice of the peace or a court official are court records available for examination by members of the general public.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">An appeal brought by the Attorney General of Nova Scotia and by Mr. Grainger to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was dismissed. The Appeal Division proceeded on much broader grounds than Richard J. The order dismissing the appeal contained a declaration "that a member of the public is entitled to inspect informations upon which search warrants have been issued pursuant to section 443 of the </span><span lang="EN-CA"><i>Crimi</i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">nal Code</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%"></span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">of Canada". The Court also declared that Mr. MacIntyre was entitled to be present in open court when the search warrants were issued. This right, the Appeal Division said, extended to any member of the public, including individuals who would be the subjects of the search warrants.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">This Court granted leave to appeal the judgment and order of the Appeal Division. The Attorney General of Canada and the Attorneys General of the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta intervened to support the appellant Attorney General of Nova Scotia. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association intervened in support of Mr. Maclntyre.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Although Mr. MacIntyre happens to be a journalist employed by the C.B.C. he has throughout taken the position that his standing is no higher than that of any member of the general public.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">A search warrant may be broadly defined as an order issued by a justice under statutory powers, authorizing a named person to enter a specified place to search for and seize specified property which will afford evidence of the actual or intended commission of a crime. A warrant may issue upon a sworn information and proof of reasonable grounds for its issuance. The property seized must be carried before the justice who issued the warrant to be dealt with by him according to law.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The search warrant in recent years has become an increasingly important investigatory aid, as crime and criminals become increasingly sophisticated and the incidence of corporate white collar crime multiplies. The effectiveness of any search made pursuant to the issuance of a search warrant will depend much upon timing, upon the degree of confidentiality which attends the issuance of the warrant and upon the element of surprise which attends the search.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">As is often the case in a free society there are at work two conflicting public interests. The one has to do with civil liberties and the protection of the individual from interference with the enjoyment of his property. There is a clear and important social value in avoidance of arbitrary searches and unlawful seizures. The other, competing, interest lies in the effective detection and proof of crime and the prompt apprehension and conviction of offenders. Public protection, afforded by efficient and effective law enforcement, is enhanced through the proper use of search warrants.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In this balancing of interests, Parliament has made a clear policy choice. The public interest in the detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes has been permitted to dominate the individual interest. To the extent of its reach, s. 443 has been introduced as an aid in the administration of justice and enforcement of the provisions of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Criminal </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA">Code</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA"></span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA">.</span></i></p>

And there is little authority on the point. The appellant Attorney General of Nova Scotia relied upon Taylor's </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Treatise on the Law of Evidence </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">(11th ed. 1920), upon a footnote to Order 63, Rule 4 of the English Rules of Court, and upon </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Rossminster Ltd., </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">[1980] 2 W.L.R. 1. These authorities indicate that under English practice there is no general right to inspect and copy judicial records and documents. The right is only exerciseable when some direct</span></p>

12.0pt"> 181]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">and tangible interest or proprietary right in the documents can be demonstrated.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">It does seem clear that an individual who is 'directly interested' in the warrant can inspect the information and the warrant after the warrant has been executed. The reasoning here is that an interested party has a right to apply to set aside or quash a search warrant based on a defective information </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">(R. v. Solloway Mills &amp; Co., </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">[1930] 3 D.L.R. 293 (Alta. S.C.)). This right can only be exercised if the applicant is entitled to inspect the warrant and the information immediately after it has been executed. The point is discussed by Mr. Justice MacDonald of the Alberta Supreme Court in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Realty Renovations Ltd. v. Attorney-General for Alberta et al. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">(1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 249 at pp. 253-54:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Since the issue of a search warrant is a judicial act and not an administrative act, it appears to me to be fundamental that in order to exercise the right to question the validity of a search warrant, the interested party <span style="letter-spacing:.25pt">or his counsel must be able to inspect the search warrant</span> <span style="letter-spacing:
.25pt">and the information on which it is based. Although there</span> is no appeal from the issue of a search warrant, a superior Court has the right by prerogative writ to review the act of the Justice of the Peace in issuing the warrant. In order to launch a proper application, the applicant should know the reasons or grounds for his application, which reasons or grounds are most likely to be found in the form of the information or warrant. I am <span style="letter-spacing:.25pt">unable to conceive anything but a denial of Justice if the</span> contents of the information and warrant, after the warrant is executed, are hidden until the police have completed the investigation or until the Crown prosecutor decides that access to the file containing the warrant is <span style="letter-spacing:.25pt">to be allowed. Such a restriction could effectively delay,</span> if not prevent review of the judicial act of the Justice in the issue of the warrant. If a warrant is void then it <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">should be set aside as soon as possible and the earlier the</span> application to set it aside can be heard, the more the right of the individual is protected.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">The appellant, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia, does not contest the right of an 'interested party' to inspect search warrants and informations after execution. His contention is that Mr. MacIntyre, a member of the general public, not directly affected by issuance of the warrant, has no right of inspection. The question, therefore, is whether, in</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 182]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">law, any distinction can be drawn, in respect of accessibility, between those persons who might be termed 'interested parties' and those members of the public who are unable to show any special interest in the proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There would seem to be only two Canadian cases which have addressed the point. In (1959-60), 2 Crim. L.Q., 119, reference is made to an unreported decision of Greschuk J. in <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">Southam Publishing Company v. Mack </span></i>in Supreme Court Chambers in Calgary, Alberta. Mandamus was granted requiring a magistrate to permit a reporter of the <i>Calgary <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Herald </span></i>to inspect the information and complaints which were in his possession relating to cases the magistrate had dealt with on a particular date.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Realty Renovations Ltd. v. Attorney-General for Alberta, supra, </span></i>MacDonald J. concluded his judgment with these words:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I further declare that upon execution of the search <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">warrant, the information in support and the warrant are</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">matters of Court Record and are available for inspection</span> on demand.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is only fair to observe, however, that in that case the person seeking access was an "interested party" and therefore the broad declaration, quoted above, strictly speaking went beyond what was required for the decision.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">American courts have recognized a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents. Such common law right has been recognized, for example, in courts of the District of Columbia <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">(Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc. </span></i>(1978), 98 S. Ct. 1306). In that case Mr. Justice Powell, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, observed at p. 1311:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Both petitioner and respondents acknowledge the existence of a common-law right of access to judicial records, but they differ sharply over its scope and the circumstances warranting restrictions of it.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">By reason of the relatively few judicial decisions it is difficult, and probably unwise, to attempt any comprehensive definition of the right of access to judicial records or delineation of the factors to be taken into account in determining whether access is to be permitted. The question before us is limited to search warrants and informations. The response to that question, it seems to me, should be guided by several broad policy considerations, namely, respect for the privacy of the individual, protection of the administration of justice, implementation of the will of Parliament that a search warrant be an effective aid in the investigation of crime, and finally, a strong public policy in favour of "openness" in respect of judicial acts. The rationale of this last-mentioned consideration has been eloquently expressed by Bentham in these terms:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">'In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice.' 'Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial.'</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">The concern for accountability is not diminished by the fact that the search warrants might be issued by a justice </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">in camera. On </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">the contrary, this fact increases the policy argument in favour of accessibility. Initial secrecy surrounding the issuance of warrants may lead to abuse, and publicity</span></p>

12.0pt"> 184]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">is a strong deterrent to potential malversation.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In short, what should be sought is maximum accountability and accessibility but not to the extent of harming the innocent or of impairing the efficiency of the search warrant as a weapon in society's never-ending fight against crime.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">IV</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The appellant, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia, says in effect that the search warrants are none of Mr. Maclntyre's business. MacIntyre is not directly interested in the sense that his premises have been the object of a search. Why then should he be entitled to see them?</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">There are two principal arguments advanced in support of the position of the appellant. The first might be termed the 'privacy' argument. It is submitted that the privacy rights of the individuals who have been the object of searches would be violated if persons like Mr. MacIntyre were permitted to inspect the warrants. It is argued that the warrants are issued merely on proof of 'reasonable grounds' to believe that there is evidence with respect to the commission of a criminal offence in a "building, receptacle or place". At this stage of the proceedings no criminal charge has been laid and there is no assurance that a charge ever will be laid. Moreover, search warrants are often issued to search the premises of a third party who is in no way privy to any wrongdoing, but is in possession of material necessary to the inquiry. Why, it is asked, submit these individuals to embarrassment and public suspicion through release of search warrants?</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The second, independent, submission of the appellant might be termed the 'administration of justice' argument. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the search warrant procedure depends to a large extent on the element of surprise. If the occupier of the premises were informed in advance of the warrant, he would dispose of the goods. Therefore, the public must be denied access to the warrants, otherwise the legislative purposes and</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">intention of Parliament, embodied in s. 443 of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Criminal Code, </span></i>would be frustrated.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">V</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Let me deal first with the 'privacy' argument. This is not the first occasion on which such an argument has been tested in the courts. Many times it has been urged that the 'privacy' of litigants requires that the public be excluded from court proceedings. It is now well established, however, that covertness is the exception and openness the rule. Public confidence in the integrity of the court system and understanding of the administration of justice are thereby fostered. As a general rule the sensibilities of the individuals involved are no basis for exclusion of the public from judicial proceedings. The following comments of Laurence J. in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">R. v. Wright, 8 </span></i>T.R. 293, are apposite and were cited with approval by Duff J. in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Gazette Printing Co. v. Shallow </span></i>(1909), 41 S.C.R. 339 at p. 359:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">Though the publication of such proceedings may be to</span><span lang="EN-CA"> <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">the disadvantage of the particular individual concerned,</span> yet it is of vast importance to the public that the proceedings of courts </span><span lang="EN-CA">of </span><span lang="EN-CA">justice should be universally <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">known. The general advantage to the country in having</span> these proceedings made public more than counterbal<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">ances the inconveniences to the private persons whose</span> conduct may be the subject of such proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The leading case is the decision of the House of Lords in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Scott v. Scott, </span></i>[1913] A.C. 417. In the later case of <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">McPherson v. McPherson, </span></i>[1936] A.C. 177, at p. 200, Lord Blanesburgh, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, referred to "publicity" as the "authentic hallmark of judicial as distinct from administrative procedure".</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is, of course, true that <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Scott v. Scott </span></i>and <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">McPherson v. McPherson </span></i>were cases in which proceedings had reached the stage of trial whereas the issuance of a search warrant takes place at the pre-trial investigative stage. The cases mentioned, however, and many others which could be cited, establish the broad principle of "openness" in judicial proceedings, whatever their nature, and in the exercise of judicial powers. The same policy con<span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">siderations</span></span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">upon which is predicated our reluctance to inhibit accessibility at the trial stage are still present and should be addressed at the pretrial stage. Parliament has seen fit, and properly so, considering the importance of the derogation from fundamental common law rights, to involve the judiciary in the issuance of search warrants and the disposition of the property seized, if any. I find it difficult to accept the view that a judicial act performed during a trial is open to public scrutiny but a judicial act performed at the pretrial stage remains shrouded in secrecy.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The reported cases have not generally distinguished between judicial proceedings which are part of a trial and those which are not. </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.6pt">Ex parte </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">applications for injunctions, interlocutory proceedings, or preliminary inquiries are not trial proceedings, and yet the 'open court' rule applies in these cases. The authorities have held that subject to a few well-recognized exceptions, as in the case of infants, mentally disordered persons or secret processes, all judicial proceedings must be held in public. The editor of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.6pt">Halsbury's </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">4th Edition states the rule in these terms:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.05pt">In general, all cases, both civil and criminal, must be</span><span lang="EN-CA"> heard in open court, but in certain exceptional cases, <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">where the administration of justice would be rendered</span> <span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">impracticable by the presence of the public, the court</span> may sit in camera [Vol. 10, para. 705, at p. 316].</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">At every stage the rule should be one of public accessibility and concomitant judicial accountability; all with a view to ensuring there is no abuse in the issue of search warrants, that once issued they are executed according to law, and finally that any evidence seized is dealt with according to law. A decision by the Crown not to prosecute, notwithstanding the finding of evidence appearing to establish the commission of a crime may, in some circumstances, raise issues of public importance.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In my view, curtailment of public accessibility can only be justified where there is present the need to protect social values of superordinate</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 187]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">importance. One of these is the protection of the innocent.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Many search warrants are issued and executed, and nothing is found. In these circumstances, does the interest served by giving access to the public outweigh that served in protecting those persons whose premises have been searched and nothing has been found? Must they endure the stigmatization to name and reputation which would follow publication of the search? Protection of the innocent from unnecessary harm is a valid and important policy consideration. In my view that consideration overrides the public access interest in those cases where a search is made and nothing is found. The public right to know must yield to the protection of the innocent. If the warrant is executed and something is seized, other considerations come to bear.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">VI</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">That brings me to the second argument raised by the appellant. The point taken here is that the effective administration of justice would be frustrated if individuals were permitted to be present when the warrants were issued. Therefore, the proceeding must be conducted </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">in camera, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">as an exception to the open court principle. I agree. The effective administration of justice does justify the exclusion of the public from the proceedings attending the actual issuance of the warrant. The Attorneys General have established, at least to my satisfaction, that if the application for the warrant were made in open court the search for the instrumentalities of crime would, at best, be severely hampered and, at worst, rendered entirely fruitless. In a process in which surprise and secrecy may play a decisive role the occupier of the premises to be searched would be alerted, before the execution of the warrant, with the probable consequence of destruction or removal of evidence. I agree with counsel for the Attorney General of Ontario that the presence in an open courtroom of members of the public, media personnel, and, potentially, contacts of suspected accused in respect of whom the search is to be made, would</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 188]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">render the mechanism of a search warrant utterly useless.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">None of the counsel before us sought to sustain the position of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the issue of the search warrant is a judicial act which should be performed in open court by a justice of the peace with the public present. The respondent Mr. MacIntyre stated in paragraph 5 of his factum:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">One must note that the Respondent never sought <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">documentation relating to unexecuted search warrants</span> nor did he ever request to be present during the decision making process .. .</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">It appeared clear during argument that the act of issuing the search warrant is, in practice, rarely, if ever, performed in open court. Search warrants are issued in private at all hours of the day or night, in the chambers of the justice by day or in his home by night. Section 443(1) of the <i>Code </i>seems to recognize the possibility of exigent situations in stating that a justice may "at any time" issue a warrant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Although the rule is that of "open court" the rule admits of the exception referred to in <i>Halsb</i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.1pt">ury, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">namely, that in exceptional cases, where the administration of justice would be rendered impracticable by the presence of the public, the court may sit </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:
150%;letter-spacing:.1pt">in </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">camera. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The issuance of a search warrant is such a case.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In my opinion, however, the force of the 'administration of justice' argument abates once the warrant has been executed, <i>i.e. </i>after entry and search. There is thereafter a "diminished interest in confidentiality" as the purposes of the policy of secrecy are largely, if not entirely, accomplished. The need for continued concealment virtually disappears. The appellant concedes that at this point individuals who are directly 'interested' in the warrant have a right to inspect it. To that extent at least it enters the public domain. The appellant must, however, in some manner, justify granting access to the individuals directly concerned, while denying access to the public in general. I can find no compelling reason for distinguishing between</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 189]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">the occupier of the premises searched and the public. The curtailment of the traditionally uninhibited accessibility of the public to the working of the courts should be undertaken with the greatest reluctance.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The 'administration of justice' argument is based on the fear that certain persons will destroy evidence and thus deprive the police of the fruits of their search. Yet the appellant agrees these very individuals (i.e. those 'directly interested') have a right to see the warrant, and the material upon which it is based, once it has been executed. The appellants do not argue for blanket confidentiality with respect to warrants. Logically, if those directly interested can see the warrant, a third party who has no interest in the case at all is not a threat to the administration of justice. By definition, he has no evidence that he can destroy. Concern for preserving evidence and for the effective administration of justice cannot justify excluding him.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Undoubtedly every court has a supervisory and protecting power over its own records. Access can be denied when the ends of justice would be subverted by disclosure or the judicial documents might be used for an improper purpose. The presumption, however, is in favour of public access and the burden of contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercice of the right.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am not unaware that the foregoing may seem a departure from English practice, as I understand it, but it is in my view more consonant with the openness of judicial proceedings which English case law would seem to espouse.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">VII</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I conclude that the administration of justice argument does justify an <i>in camera </i>proceeding at the time of issuance of the warrant but, once the warrant has been executed, exclusion thereafter of members of the public cannot normally be coun<span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">tenanced.</span></span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The general rule of public access must prevail, save in respect of those whom I have referred to as innocent persons.</span></p>

The respondent is a television journalist employed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who, at the material time, was researching a story on political patronage and fund raising.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The respondent gave notice to the appellants of an intended application in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Trial Division, for "an Order in the nature of mandamus and/or a declaratory judgment to the effect that the search warrants and Informations relating thereto issued pursuant to Section 443 of the Criminal Code of Canada or other related or similar statutes are a matter of public record and may be inspected by a member of the public upon reasonable request".</span></p>

It will be noted that this order was limited to search warrants which had been executed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">The appellants appealed unsuccessfully to the Appeal Division. The judgment dismissing the appeal contained the following declaration:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">This declaration was broader in its scope than that made by Richard J. in that it was not limited to search warrants which had been executed.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">The appellants, by leave of this Court, have appealed from the judgments of the Appeal Division. The two issues stated by the appellants are as </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(i) Are search warrants issued pursuant to Section 443 of the <u>Criminal Code</u> issued in open court and are they and the informations pertaining thereto consequently documents open for public inspection,</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(ii) Whether there is otherwise a general right to inspect search warrants and the informations pertaining thereto.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">With respect to the first issue, I am in agreement with my brother Dickson, for the reasons which he has given, that the broad declaration made by the Appeal Division cannot be sustained.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:1.0pt">That</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%"> being so, the respondent cannot assert a right to examine the search warrants and the related informations on the basis that the issuance of the search warrants was a judicial act in open court with a right for the public to be present.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">That brings us to the second issue defined by the appellants as to whether there is a general right to inspect search warrants and the informations pertaining thereto. This was the real basis of the submission of the respondent who did not seek to sustain the position taken by the Appeal Division. His position is that search warrants issued under s. 443 and the informations pertaining thereto are court documents which are open to general public inspection.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">The respondent relies upon an ancient English statute enacted in 1372, 46 Edward III. An English translation of this Act, which was enacted in law French, appears in a note at the end of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:1.2pt">Caddy v. Barlow </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">(1827), 1 Man. &amp; Ry. 275 at pp. 279-80. I will quote that part of the note which includes the statutory provision:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">It appears that originally all judicial records of the <span style="letter-spacing:.25pt">King's Courts were open to the public without restraint,</span> <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">and were preserved for that purpose. Lord Coke, in his</span> preface to 3 Co. Rep. 3, speaking on this subject says, "these records, for that they contain great and hidden treasure, are faithfully and safely kept, (as they well <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">deserve), in the king's treasury. And yet not so kept but</span> that any subject may for his necessary use and benefit have access thereunto; which was the ancient law of England, and so is declared by an act of Parliament in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:1.1pt">46 Edw. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">3, in these</span><span lang="EN-CA"> <span style="letter-spacing:1.6pt">words:</span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> Also the Commons pray,</span> that, whereas records, and whatsoever is in the King's Court, ought of reason to remain there, for perpetual <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">evidence and aid of all parties thereto, and of all those</span> <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">whom in any manner they reach, when they have need;</span> and yet of late they refuse, in the Court of our said Lord, to make search or exemplification of any thing which can fall in evidence against the King, or in his <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">disadvantage.

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">as other persons. <i>Le Roy le voet."</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The respondent cites this legislation in support of the proposition that a member of the public has access to all judicial records. However, the provisions of the statute did not go that far. It referred to "whatever record <u>touches</u> them in any manner". (Emphasis added.) I take this as meaning that to obtain the benefit of the statute the person had to show that the document sought to be searched in some way affected his interests.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This view is supported by the portion of the footnote which precedes the quotation of the statute. Lord Coke states that any subject may have access to the records "for his necessary use and benefit".</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The case of <i>Caddy v. Barlow </i>itself related to the admissibility, in an action for malicious prosecution, of a copy of an indictment against the plaintiff which had been granted to her brother, the co-accused.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The respondent refers to the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <i>The Attorney-General v. </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Scully </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(1902), 4 O.L.R. 394, in which reference is made to <i>Caddy v. Barlow </i>and to the English statute. That case dealt with an application made to the clerk of the peace for a copy of the indictment in a criminal charge of theft against the applicant who had been acquitted. He obviously had an interest in obtaining the document.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Appeal Division in the present case which, as previously noted, based its decision to permit the examination of the search warrants and informations upon its conclusion that these documents were produced at a judicial hearing in open court, did deal with the assertion of a general right to examine court documents in the following passage in its reasons;</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In my opinion at common law courts have always exercised control over their process in open court and <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">access to the records.

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">there have always been some parts of the court file that are available only to "persons interested" and this "interest" must be established to the satisfaction of the court. Parties to civil actions and the accused in criminal proceedings have always been held by the courts to be persons so interested. Other persons must establish their right to see particular documents before being entitled to do so.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.1pt">The Appeal Division cited in its reasons paragraphs 1492 and 1493 of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Taylor </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.1pt">on Evidence, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.1pt">11th ed.

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">1492. It is highly questionable whether the <i>records of inferior tribunals </i>are open to the inspection of all persons without distinction; but it is clear that everyone has a right to inspect and take copies of the parts of the proceedings in which he is individually interested. The party, therefore, who wishes to examine any particular record of one of those courts, should first apply to that court, showing that he has some interest in the document in question, and that he requires it for a proper purpose. 1f his application be refused, the Chancery, or the King's Bench Division of the High Court, upon affidavit of the fact, may send either for the record itself or an exemplification; or the latter court will, by mandamus, obtain for the applicant the inspection or copy required. Thus, where a person, after having been convicted by a magistrate under the game laws, had an action brought against him for the same offence, the Court of Queen's Bench held that he was entitled to a copy of the conviction; and the magistrate having refused to give him one, they granted a writ of certiorari, for the mere purpose of procuring a copy, and of thus enabling the defendant to defeat the action. So, where a party, who had been sued in a court of conscience and had been taken in execution, brought an action of trespass and false imprisonment, the judges granted him a rule to inspect so much of the book of the proceedings as related to the suit against himself.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">1493. Indeed, it may be laid down as a general rule, that the King's Bench Division will <i>enforce by mandamus the production of every document of a public nature, </i>in which any one of his Majesty's subjects can prove himself to be <i>interested. </i>Every officer, therefore, appointed by law to keep records ought to deem himself a trustee for all interested parties, and allow them to</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">inspect such documents as concern themselves,—without putting them to the expense and trouble of making a formal application for a mandamus. But the applicant must show that he has some direct and tangible interest in the documents sought to be inspected, and that the inspection is <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">bona fide </span></i>required on some special and public ground, or the court will not interfere in his favour; and therefore, if his object be merely to gratify a rational curiosity, or to obtain information on some general subject, or to ascertain facts which may be indirectly useful to him in some ulterior proceedings, he cannot claim inspection as a right capable of being enforced.</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The applicant's interest in the documents must be direct and tangible. Neither curiosity, even though rational, nor the ascertainment of facts which may be useful for furthering some ulterior object, constitutes a sufficient interest to bring an applicant within the rule on which the court acts in granting a mandamus for the inspection of public documents.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Although reasonable grounds must be shown for requiring inspection, it is not necessary to show as a ground for the application for a mandamus to inspect documents that a suit has been actually instituted. It will suffice to show that there is some particular matter in dispute and that the applicant is interested therein.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">It is quite clear that the respondent has no direct and tangible interest in the documents which he sought to examine.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">It is suggested that a broader right might be recognized consonant with the openness of judicial proceedings.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">other things which may afford evidence with respect to the commission of a criminal offence. A justice is empowered by the section to authorize this to be done. Before giving such authority, he must be satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for believing that there is in the building, receptacle or place anything in respect of which an offence has been committed or is suspected to have been committed; anything that there is reasonable ground to believe will afford evidence of the commission of a criminal offence; or anything that there is reasonable ground to believe is intended to be used for the commission of an offence against the person for which a person may be arrested without warrant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The function of the justice may be considered to be a judicial function, but might more properly be described as a function performed by a judicial officer, since no notice is required to anyone, there is no opposite party before him and, in fact, in the case of a search before proceedings are instituted, no opposite party exists. There is no requirement that the justice should perform his function in court. The justice does not adjudicate, nor does he make any order. His power is to give authority to do certain things which are a part of pretrial preparation by the Crown. No provision is made in either s. 443 or s. 446 for an examination by anyone of the documents on the basis of which the justice issued a search warrant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">As the function of the justice is not adjudicative and is not performed in open court, cases dealing with the requirement of court proceedings being carried on in public, such as </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Scott v.

McPherson, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[1936] A.C. 177, are not, in my opinion, relevant to the issue before the Court. The documents which the respondent seeks to examine are not documents filed in court proceedings. They are the necessary requirements which enable the justice to grant permission for the Crown to pursue its investigation of possible crimes and to prepare for criminal proceedings.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">If the documents in question in this appeal are not subject to public examination prior to the execution of the search warrants, I see no logical reason why they should become subject to such examination thereafter, at least until the case in respect of which the search has been made has come to trial. It is true that a search of those documents before the search warrant has been executed might frustrate the very purpose for which the warrant was issued by forewarning the person whose premises were to be searched. The element of surprise is essential to the proper enforcement of the criminal law. There are, however, additional and important reasons why such documents should not be made public which continue even after the warrant has been executed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The information upon oath on the basis of which a search warrant may be issued is in Form 1 contained in Part XXV of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>It requires a description of the offence in respect of which the search is to be made. The informant must state that he has reasonable grounds for believing that the things for which the search is to be made are in a particular place and must state the grounds for such belief. This document, which may be submitted to the justice before any charges have been laid, discloses the informant's statement that an offence has been committed or is intended to be committed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The disclosure of such information before trial could be prejudicial to the fair trial of the person suspected of having committed such crime. Publication of such information prior to trial is even more serious.</span></p>

The publication of proceedings in courts of justice, where both sides are heard, and matters are finally determined, is salutary, and therefore it </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">is </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">permitted. The publication of these <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">preliminary examinations has a tendency to pervert the</span> <span style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt">public mind, and to disturb the course of justice; and it</span> is therefore illegal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Inspection of the information and the search warrant would enable the person inspecting the documents to discover the identity of the informant. In certain types of cases this might well place the informant in jeopardy. It was this kind of risk which led to the recognition in law of the right of the police to protect from disclosure the identity of police informants. That right exists even where a police officer is testifying at a trial. The same kind of risk arises in relation to persons who give information leading to the issuance of a search warrant. For the same reasons which justify the police in refusing to disclose the identity of an informer, public disclosure of documents from which the identity of the informant may be ascertained should not be compelled.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In his reasons, my brother Dickson has referred to the fact that in recent years the search warrant has become an increasingly important investigatory aid as crime and criminals become increasingly sophisticated and has pointed out that the effectiveness of a search pursuant to a search warrant depends, <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">inter </span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">alia, </span></i>on the degree of confidentiality which attends the issuance of the warrant. To insure such confidentiality, it is essential that criminal organizations, such as those involved in the drug traffic, should be prevented, as far as possible, from obtaining the means to discover the identity of persons assisting the police.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Apart from the protection of the identity of the person furnishing the information upon which the issuance of a search warrant is founded, it is undesirable, in the public interest, that those engaged in criminal activities should have available to them information which discloses the pattern of police activities in connection with searches.

150%">The warrant was obtained because of suspected tax frauds. When executed, the occupants of the premises were not told the offences alleged or the "reasonable ground" on which the judge issuing the warrant had acted. In his reasons for judgment, <span style="letter-spacing:.9pt">Lord </span>Wilberforce said, at pp. </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">37-38:</span></i></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">But, on the plain words of the enactment, the officers are entitled if they can persuade the board and the judge, to enter and search <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">premises </span></i>regardless of whom they belong to: a warrant which confers this power is strictly and exactly within the parliamentary authority, and the occupier has no answer to it. I accept that some information as regards the person(s) who are alleged to have committed an offence and possibly as to the <span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">approximate dates of the offences must almost certainly</span> have been laid before the board and the judge. But the <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">occupier has no right to be told of this at this stage, nor</span> has he the right to be informed of the "reasonable grounds" of which the judge was satisfied. Both courts <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">agree as to this: all this information is clearly protected</span> by the public interest immunity which covers investigations into possible criminal offences. With reference to the police, Lord Reid stated this in these words:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">"The police are carrying on an unending war with criminals many of whom are today highly intelligent. So it is essential that there should be no disclosure of anything which might give any useful information to those who organise criminal activities. And it would generally be wrong to require disclosure in a civil case of anything which might be material in a pending prosecution: but after a verdict has been given or it has been decided to take no proceedings there is not the same need for secrecy." <i>(Conway v. Rimmer </i>[1968] A.C. 910, at pp. 953-954.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">The release to the public of the contents of informations and search warrants may also be harmful to a person whose premises are permitted to be searched and who may have no personal connection with the commission of the offence. The fact that his premises are the subject of a search warrant generates suspicion that he was in some way involved in the offence. Publication of</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">the fact that such a warrant had been issued in respect of his premises would be highly prejudicial to him.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">For these reasons, I am not satisfied that there is any valid reason for departing from the rule as stated in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Halsbury (supra) so </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">as to afford to the general public the right to inspect documents forming part of the search warrant procedure under s. 443.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In summary, my conclusion is that proceedings before a justice under s. 443 being part and parcel of criminal investigative procedure are not analogous to trial proceedings, which are generally required to be conducted in open court. The opening to public inspection of the documents before the justice is not equivalent to the right of the public to attend and witness proceedings in court. Access to these documents should be restricted, in accordance with the practice established in England, to persons who can show an interest in the documents which is direct and tangible. Clearly the respondent had no such interest.</span></p>
