The accused was later charged with sexual assault and tried before a jury.&nbsp; At trial, the accused testified that, in his view, the complainant was in a condition to be “able to control what she was doing”. He said that they kissed each other and then she invited him to come to her bedroom, where they had consensual sexual intercourse. The complainant testified that she was drunk and denied kissing the accused and inviting him to her bedroom.&nbsp; She testified that she had no memory of anything from the time she went to her bedroom until the next morning when she awoke and realized that she had engaged in sexual intercourse.&nbsp; Although she could not remember what occurred, the complainant testified that she would not have consented to intercourse with the accused because they were related. The trial judge charged the jury on the issue of consent, but not on the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.&nbsp; Defence counsel did not object. The accused was convicted of sexual assault.&nbsp; On appeal, the Court of Appeal, by majority, allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial.&nbsp; The court concluded that there was an ‘air of reality’ to the defence of honest but mistaken belief and that, notwithstanding the failure of defence counsel to raise the issue, the trial judge was obliged to put that defence to the jury.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Gonthier, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: Before a court should consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief or instruct a jury on it there must be some plausible evidence in support so as to give an air of reality to the defence. Here, the plausible evidence comes from the testimony of the complainant and the accused and the surrounding circumstances of the alleged sexual assault.&nbsp; The accused’s evidence amounted to more than a bare assertion of belief in consent.&nbsp; He described specific words and actions on the part of the complainant that led him to believe that she was consenting.&nbsp; This alone may be enough to raise the defence, but&nbsp; there was more.&nbsp; The complainant’s evidence did not contradict that of the accused, as she cannot remember what occurred after she went to her bedroom.&nbsp; In addition there was no evidence of violence, struggle or force. The absence of resistance or violence alone could not raise the defence as it is only one factor that must be considered.&nbsp; Moreover, not only was the testimony of the parties not “diametrically opposed”, but even on a slightly stricter test, the parties’ stories may be “cobbled together” in a coherent manner. The complainant did not testify that she did not in fact consent, but was only able to say that because she was related to the accused, she would not have consented. The accused’s evidence of the complainant’s participatory actions, if believed, might lead a jury to conclude that he honestly believed she was consenting despite his being mistaken about her ability to legally consent because of intoxication.&nbsp; This meets the threshold of a plausible explanation of the facts and should have been put to the jury.&nbsp; The question of whether a particular complainant could inadvertently disguise her intoxication, say things or perform acts that raise an honest but mistaken belief in consent is for the jury to determine taking into account all the factors in the case. &nbsp;A court cannot make an <i>a priori</i> determination that honest but mistaken belief is impossible when the complainant is intoxicated.&nbsp; Lastly, while passivity by the complainant may not be consent, her absence of memory has to be considered with the evidence of the accused that the complainant seemed to participate willingly.&nbsp; This is sufficient to justify charging the jury on that defence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In any event, an application of the common law principles governing the defence leads to the same result. To put the defence of honest but mistaken belief to the jury, there must be sufficient evidence to give the defence an “air of reality”. Mere assertion of belief in consent by the accused will not suffice to give the defence an air of reality.&nbsp; As well, diametrically opposed assertions by the parties ‑‑ the complainant’s clear consent as far as the accused is concerned, and her clear refusal of consent as far as the complainant is concerned ‑‑ will seldom, if ever, give rise to the defence.&nbsp; Consent for purposes of sexual assault is found in the communication by a person with the requisite capacity by verbal or non‑verbal behaviour to another of permission to perform the sexual act. The issue of mistake as to consent must be assessed on the basis of the particular accused person before the court, but the accused cannot have been wilfully blind or reckless. An accused is not entitled to presume consent in the absence of communicative ability and thus cannot raise the defence in the case of an unconscious or incoherent complainant.&nbsp; Passivity without more is also insufficient to provide a basis for the defence.&nbsp; Since the defence of honest but mistaken belief is designed to meet the situation where there has been an honest miscommunication of non‑consent, it may arise only where the evidence indicates a situation of ambiguity resulting from the complainant’s conduct or external circumstances which the accused, not being wilfully blind or reckless and acting honestly, misinterpreted as consent.&nbsp; The requirements of the defence are thus:&nbsp; (1) evidence that the accused believed the complainant was consenting; (2) evidence that the complainant in fact refused consent, did not consent, or was incapable of consenting; and&nbsp; (3) evidence of ambiguity or equivocality showing how the accused could honestly, and without wilful blindness or recklessness, have mistaken the complainant’s lack of consent for consent.</span></p>

<div class="Section6">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here, the trial judge did not err in failing to put the defence of honest but mistaken belief to the jury, since it did not realistically arise on the evidence. The complainant and the accused presented divergent and incompatible versions of the events.&nbsp; The accused’s evidence is consistent only with capacity and actual consent.&nbsp; The complainant’s evidence is consistent with denial of consent or with unconscious incapacity to give consent.&nbsp; Either the complainant would have vehemently refused sex, or she was unconscious and incapable of refusing it.&nbsp; Neither case suggests a situation of ambiguity or equivocality which the accused could honestly have read as capacity and consent. Drunkenness cannot constitute evidence of a situation in which the complainant might appear to be consenting when in fact she was not.&nbsp; If the complainant is so drunk that she is unable to communicate, she is incapable of giving consent, and no question of honest mistake can arise.&nbsp; If she was less drunk and had the capacity to consent, the question for the jury is whether she actually consented or not, depending on whose evidence they accept.&nbsp; Further,&nbsp; the assertion that the complainant’s drunkenness and lack of memory raise the defence of honest but mistaken belief depends not on the evidence but on speculation. The law, however, does not permit speculation based on stereotypes but rather demands specific evidence of a state of affairs which could give rise to an honest misapprehension of consent when no consent existed.&nbsp; No such evidence was presented in this case. The complainant’s inability to recollect is not in itself evidence of miscommunication.&nbsp; Nor does the absence of evidence of violence support the hypothesis of honest but mistaken belief in consent.&nbsp; If the accused wrongly inferred clear capacity and an active communication of consent from lack of struggle or passivity, he must have been either wilfully blind or dishonest. On the evidence, there were thus only two possible scenarios:&nbsp; either the complainant did not consent to the sexual activity or she had capacity and consented.&nbsp; Neither scenario is consistent with the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent and there is no evidence to support a third scenario of ambiguity as to capacity or as to what was communicated.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> L’Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting): The reasons of McLachlin J. were agreed with. The traditional common law understanding of “lack of consent” as it relates to the <i>mens rea</i> in the offence of sexual assault should be changed.&nbsp; The customary focus on the complainant’s communication of refusal or rejection of the sexual touching in question should be rejected in favour of an assessment of whether and how the accused ascertained that the complainant was consenting to such activity.&nbsp; The <i>mens rea</i> of the offence should be established where the accused is shown to have been aware of or reckless or wilfully blind as to the fact that the complainant has not communicated consent to the activity in question.&nbsp; In determining whether an accused had the requisite culpable state of mind, it is necessary for the trier of fact objectively to examine not only the verbal and behavioural indicators in the evidence of the complainant’s subjective state, but also the accused’s subjective perception thereof, in light of any relevant circumstances known to him at the time.&nbsp; Where an accused has demonstrated that he honestly, with some basis in the circumstances, misperceived these indicators, and therefore lacked the necessary “culpable mind”, the defence of honest but mistaken belief may arise.&nbsp; Here, there was no evidentiary basis for ambiguous communication on the part of the complainant or external circumstances which could have influenced the perceptions of the accused.&nbsp; The trial judge was thus correct in not putting the defence to the jury.</span></p>

Park</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836,&nbsp; I similarly advocated altering the traditional common law understanding of “lack of consent” as it relates to the <i>mens rea</i> in the offence of sexual assault. This required&nbsp; rejecting the customary focus on the complainant’s communication of <u>refusal or rejection</u> of the sexual touching in question in favour of an assessment of whether and how the accused ascertained that the complainant was consenting to such activity.&nbsp; The <i>mens rea</i> for sexual assault should, therefore, also be established where the accused is aware of, or reckless or wilfully blind to, an <u>absence of communicated consent</u> on the part of the complainant.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

As this Court did not have the benefit of any argument on the aspects discussed by my colleague in this section, I would prefer to reserve these matters for another time.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">As McLachlin J. has now adopted this understanding of consent in her reasons in the present appeal, some elaboration of the general principles and rationale as articulated in <i>Park</i>,<i> supra</i>, is in order.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt">33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Park</i>, <i>supra</i>, after clarifying a number of difficulties which relate to&nbsp; the nature and application of the “air of reality” test to honest belief defences, I observed that these appear to flow from our approach to the <i>mens rea</i> of the offence of sexual assault in the common law. It is well understood that the <i>mens rea</i> of the offence of sexual assault requires that the accused intended to touch the complainant in a sexual manner and knew that the complainant was not consenting, or was reckless or wilfully blind to the fact. In application, these requirements have translated into an onus on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of, or reckless or wilfully blind to the complainant’s <u>communication of non-consent</u>.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt">34 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the <i>mens rea</i> should also be established where the accused is shown to have been aware of or reckless or wilfully blind as to the fact that&nbsp; the complainant has <u>not communicated consent</u> to the activity in question. As I stated at para. 39 of the judgment:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">In other words, the <i>mens rea</i> of sexual assault is not only satisfied when it is shown that the accused knew that the complainant was essentially saying “no”, but is also satisfied when it is shown that the accused knew that the complainant was essentially not saying “yes”.</p>

As society’s mores and attitudes as regards gender roles and relations have changed, the aim of this criminal offence has evolved from its original focus on the proprietary rights men once had over their wives and children and even the more recent emphasis on the physical harm caused by forced sexual activity to a complainant.&nbsp; As I&nbsp; indicated in <i>Park</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 42, today’s offence of sexual assault is founded on respect for women’s “inherent right to exercise full control over their own bodies, and to engage only in sexual activity that they wish to engage in”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt">36 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of these considerations, I advocated a shift in our perspective on this legal concept, from consent as “the private mental state” of the complainant to consent as the communication of permission to engage in behaviour from which the accused otherwise has a legal obligation to refrain. This new approach was&nbsp; developed and elaborated by L. Vandervort, in “Mistake of Law and Sexual Assault: Consent and Mens Rea” (1987-88), 2 <i>C.J.W.L.</i> 233, as I observed in <i>Park</i>,<i> supra</i>, and has been reviewed by my colleague McLachlin J. in her reasons in the present appeal.&nbsp; I note that this approach to consent in the offence of sexual assault continues to find favour in academic commentary on this issue. See H. M. Malm, “The Ontological Status of Consent and its Implications for the Law on Rape” (1996), 2 <i>Legal Theory</i> 147; A. Wertheimer, “Consent and Sexual Relations” (1996), 2 <i>Legal Theory</i> 89.</p>

In determining whether an accused had the requisite culpable state of mind, it is necessary for the trier of fact objectively to examine not only the verbal and behavioural indicators in the evidence of the complainant’s subjective state, but also the accused’s subjective perception thereof, in light of any relevant circumstances known to him at the time. Where an accused has demonstrated that he honestly, with some basis in the circumstances, misperceived these indicators, and therefore lacked the necessary “culpable mind”, the defence of honest but mistaken belief may arise.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">An accused cannot say that he believed the complainant to be consenting without pointing to the basis for that belief. As a practical matter, therefore, the principal considerations that are relevant to this defence are (1) the complainant’s actual communicative behaviour, and (2) the totality of the admissible and relevant evidence&nbsp; explaining how the accused <u>perceived</u> that behaviour to communicate consent. Everything else is ancillary.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</p>

Contemporary social norms and beliefs as regards sexual behaviour and sexual assault are fortunately evolving to reflect this ideal. These provide ample grounds and a strong impetus for this Court to develop the common law approach to consent along the lines suggested above and as applied by my colleague to the case at bar.</p>

There is no evidentiary basis at all for ambiguous communication on the part of the complainant or external circumstances which could have influenced the perceptions of the accused. To put this defence to the jury would require assumptions about the behaviour of severely intoxicated women which have no demonstrated basis in reality and could potentially be seen as biased or stereotypical.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It is an irony that while we are celebrating women’s rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection and we must emphasise that the courts must deal with rape cases in particular with utmost sensitivity and appreciate the evidence in the totality of the background of the entire case and not in isolation.</p>

Singh</i>, (1996) 2 S.C.C. 384.&nbsp; These comments are most apposite in the present appeal. We must remain sensitive to the very serious danger involved in putting this defence to the jury. In so doing, in this case, the Court is effectively permitting the trier of fact to proceed on the basis of potentially biased assumptions as opposed to the totality of the evidence. Such an approach would likely serve to perpetuate inequality between the genders, a result which should be avoided by this Court.</p>

Given the fact that human beings have the capacity to understand each other on matters such as these, the two states do not usually go together.&nbsp; To believably be combined, these two propositions require a third element of proof -- evidence explaining how it could be that the complainant’s non-consent could honestly be read by the accused as consent.&nbsp; Without this third element, the scenario of honest but mistaken belief, while perhaps a theoretical possibility,&nbsp; is not plausible.&nbsp; When the cases speak of more being required than the defendant’s assertion of belief the complainant consented, or of the need for an “air of reality” to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, it is to this third element that they typically refer.&nbsp; There must be evidence not only of non-consent and belief in consent, but in addition evidence capable of explaining how the accused could honestly have mistaken the complainant’s lack of consent as consent.&nbsp; Otherwise, the defence cannot reasonably arise.&nbsp; There must, in short, be evidence of a situation of ambiguity in which the accused could honestly have misapprehended that the complainant was consenting to the sexual activity in question.</p>

Consent can be revoked at any time.&nbsp; The person who assaults an unconscious woman cannot know whether, were she conscious, she would&nbsp; revoke the earlier consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; He therefore takes the risk that she may later claim she was assaulted without consent.</p>

Much less does it offer any indication of capacity, deliberateness or voluntariness.&nbsp; Absent exceptional circumstances, it is unrealistic to suppose that a person acting honestly and without wilful blindness could draw an inference of consent from mere passivity.&nbsp; Putting it another way,&nbsp; to say that passivity amounts to consent is to presume consent.&nbsp; To equate submission with consent is to overlook the essential character of consent as a social act whereby one person confers on another person the right to do something.&nbsp; Women may submit for many reasons inconsistent with consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, something more is required to permit the inference that the passive person is consenting.&nbsp; It follows that passivity alone is insufficient to provide a basis for a defence of honest but mistaken belief.&nbsp; Additional evidence of circumstances or conduct is required to establish the situation of ambiguity that underlies the defence.&nbsp; It is only with such evidence that passivity falls into one of the final two categories:&nbsp; (g) or (h).</p>

It is difficult in this age to conceive of a man so concluding in the absence of wilful blindness or dishonesty.&nbsp; It is now recognized that the fact that a woman is a prostitute or perceived as promiscuous does not render her refusal any less valid than another woman’s refusal: <i>R. v</i>. <i>Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, <i>per</i> McLachlin J., at p. 604, and <i>per</i> L’Heureux-Dubé J., at p. 690.</p>

Mayberry</i>, 542 P.2d 1337 (1975), the Supreme Court of California ruled that the evidentiary predicate of an instruction to the jury on mistake as to consent was evidence not only that the accused in good faith believed the complainant was consenting, but of “equivocal” behaviour which “might have misled [Mayberry] as to whether she was consenting” (p. 1346).&nbsp; In <i>People v. Romero</i>, 215 Cal. Rptr. 634 (Ct. App. 1985), it was said that there must be evidence that the “manner in which the victim expressed her lack of consent was so equivocal as to cause the accused to assume that she consented where in fact she did not” (p. 638).&nbsp; In <i>People</i> <i>v. Vasquez</i>, 281 Cal. Rptr. 661 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing <i>Rhoades</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 914), it was said that where there was a conflict between the evidence of the accused asserting consent and the evidence of the complainant asserting non-consent, the defence of mistake need not be put “(u)nless the evidence reveals <i>some way</i> to harmonize the conflicting accounts of defendant and prosecutrix through a mistake of fact, so that the jury can evaluate proof relating to defendant’s <i>belief</i> in consent (as distinguished from his mere <i>assertion</i> of consent)” (pp. 670-71 (emphasis added by Deegan J. in <i>Rhoades</i>)).</p>

Williams</i>, <i>supra</i>, the California Supreme Court revisited and reaffirmed its decision in <i>Mayberry</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the case at bar, the stories of the complainant and the defendant diverged widely in <i>Williams.&nbsp; </i>The defendant testified that the complainant was a willing and active participant in the sexual intercourse.&nbsp; The complainant, on the other hand, testified that she refused consent and was forced to have intercourse.&nbsp; The trial judge refused to instruct the jury on mistaken belief.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal reversed.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of California restored the trial judge’s decision.&nbsp; After reviewing the sharply conflicting accounts, the court held that the defence, as a matter of law, could not be put.&nbsp; In the court’s view, Williams’ testimony established only actual consent, while the complainant’s evidence, if believed, would preclude a reasonable belief in consent.&nbsp; It held that “[t]hese wholly divergent accounts create no middle ground from which Williams could argue he reasonably misinterpreted [the complainant’s] conduct” (p. 966).&nbsp; Evidence of actual consent was evidence of “unequivocal conduct”.&nbsp; Such evidence could not support the defence of mistake.&nbsp; To establish the defence, there must be evidence of equivocal conduct.&nbsp; The rule established in <i>Williams </i>has since been applied by other states: <i>Tyson v. Trigg</i>, 50 F.3d 436 (7th Cir. 1995 (Posner C.J.)); <i>Tyson v. State of Indiana</i>, 619 N.E.2d 276 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993);<i> Commonwealth v. Fionda</i>, 599 N.E.2d 635 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992).</p>
