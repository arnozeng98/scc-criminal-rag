24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Cory, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.:&nbsp; To prove the offence of aggravated assault, the Crown must establish (1)&nbsp; that the accused‚Äôs acts ‚Äúendanger[ed] the life of the complainant‚Äù (s.&nbsp;268(1)) and (2) that he intentionally applied force without the consent of the complainant (s.&nbsp;265(1)(<i>a</i>)).&nbsp; The first requirement is satisfied in this case by the significant risk to the lives of the complainants occasioned by the act of unprotected intercourse.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to establish that the complainants were in fact infected with the virus.&nbsp; With respect to the second requirement, it is no longer necessary, when examining whether consent in assault or sexual assault cases was vitiated by fraud under s.&nbsp;265(3)(<i>c</i>), to consider whether the fraud is related to ‚Äúthe nature and quality of the act‚Äù.&nbsp; The repeal in 1983 of statutory language imposing this requirement and its replacement by a reference simply to ‚Äúfraud‚Äù indicates that Parliament‚Äôs intention was to provide a more flexible concept of fraud in assault and sexual assault cases.&nbsp; To that end, principles which have historically been applied in relation to fraud in criminal law can be used with appropriate modifications.</span></p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In the context of the wording of s.&nbsp;265,&nbsp; an accused‚Äôs failure to disclose that he is HIV‚Äëpositive is a type of fraud which may vitiate consent to sexual intercourse.&nbsp; The essential elements of fraud in commercial criminal law are dishonesty, which can include non‚Äëdisclosure of important facts, and deprivation or risk of deprivation. The dishonest action or behaviour must be related to the obtaining of consent to engage in sexual intercourse -- in this case unprotected intercourse.&nbsp; The accused‚Äôs actions must be assessed objectively to determine whether a reasonable person would find them to be dishonest.&nbsp; The dishonest act consists of either deliberate deceit respecting HIV status or non‚Äëdisclosure of that status. Without disclosure of HIV status there cannot be a true consent.&nbsp; The consent cannot simply be to have sexual intercourse.&nbsp; Rather, it must be consent to have intercourse with a partner who is HIV‚Äëpositive. The extent of the duty to disclose will increase with the risks attendant upon the act of intercourse.&nbsp; The failure to disclose HIV‚Äëpositive status can lead to a devastating illness with fatal consequences and, in those circumstances, there exists a positive duty to disclose.&nbsp; The nature and extent of the duty to disclose, if any, will always have to be considered in the context of the particular facts presented.&nbsp; To establish that the dishonesty results in deprivation, which may consist of actual harm or simply a risk of harm, the Crown needs to prove&nbsp; that the dishonest act had the effect of exposing the person consenting to a significant risk of serious bodily harm.&nbsp; The risk of contracting AIDS as a result of engaging in unprotected intercourse meets that test.&nbsp; Further, in situations such as this, the Crown is still required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant would have refused to engage in unprotected sex with the accused if she had been advised that he was HIV‚Äëpositive.&nbsp; Therefore, a complainant‚Äôs consent to sexual intercourse can properly be found to be vitiated by fraud under s.&nbsp;265 if the accused‚Äôs failure to disclose his HIV‚Äëpositive status is dishonest and results in deprivation by putting the complainant at a significant risk of suffering serious bodily harm. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">An approach to the concept of fraud in s.&nbsp;265(3)(<i>c</i>) of the <i>Code</i> that&nbsp; includes any deceit inducing consent to contact would bring within the sexual assault provisions of the <i>Code</i> behaviour which lacks the reprehensible character of criminal acts and would trivialize the criminal process by leading to a proliferation of petty prosecutions instituted without judicial guidelines or directions.&nbsp; Some limitations to the concept of fraud in that section are necessary.&nbsp; The fraud required to vitiate consent for sexual assault must carry with it the risk of serious harm. This standard is sufficient to encompass not only the risk of HIV infection but also other sexually transmitted diseases which constitute a significant risk of serious harm.&nbsp; However, the standard is not so broad as to trivialize a serious offence.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Where public health endeavours fail to provide adequate protection to individuals like the complainants, the criminal law can be effective.&nbsp; The criminal law has a role to play both in deterring those infected with HIV from putting the lives of others at risk and in protecting the public from irresponsible individuals who refuse to comply with public health orders to abstain from high‚Äërisk activities. </span></p>

The objectives of the 1983 assault scheme are to protect people‚Äôs physical integrity from unwanted physical contact, and to protect people‚Äôs personal autonomy to decide under what conditions they will consent to be touched.&nbsp; Section 265(3) ensures that when consent is obtained, that consent is a true reflection of a person‚Äôs autonomous will. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Fraud occurs therefore, when the dishonest act in question induced another to consent to the ensuing physical act, whether or not that act was particularly risky and dangerous.&nbsp; The focus of the inquiry into whether fraud vitiated consent so as to make certain physical contact non‚Äëconsensual should be on whether the nature and execution of the deceit deprived the complainant of the ability to exercise his or her will in relation to his or her physical integrity with respect to the activity in question.&nbsp; There must be a causal connection between the fraud and the submission to the act.&nbsp; Where fraud is in issue, the impugned act is considered a non‚Äëconsensual application of force if the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused acted dishonestly in a manner designed to induce the complainant to submit to a specific activity, and that absent the dishonesty, the complainant would not have submitted to the particular activity.&nbsp; The dishonesty of the submission‚Äëinducing act would be assessed based on the objective standard of the reasonable person.&nbsp; The Crown must also prove that the accused knew, or was aware, that his or her dishonest actions would induce the complainant to submit to the particular activity. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">This interpretation of fraud as it relates to consent has the effect of maximizing the individual‚Äôs right to determine with whom, and under what conditions, he or she will consent to physical contact with another.&nbsp; This approach is also respectful of the legislative context because it can be applied with equal consistency to all of the assault offences to which the fraud provision relates.&nbsp; An interpretation of fraud that focuses only on the sexual assault context, and which limits it to those situations where a ‚Äúsignificant risk of serious bodily harm‚Äù is evident, is unjustifiably restrictive. The <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> contains no such differences between sexual assault and other assaults, and to maintain such distinctions would be contrary to the intention of the 1983 amendments.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:&nbsp; Since the 1888 decision in <i>Clarence</i>,&nbsp; the law has been settled:&nbsp; fraud does not vitiate consent to assault unless the mistake goes to the nature of the act or the identity of the partner.&nbsp; Fraud as to collateral aspects of a consensual encounter, like the possibility of contracting serious venereal disease, does not vitiate consent.&nbsp; In amending the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> in 1983 and adopting a new definition of fraud for assault, including sexual assault, Parliament did not intend to remove the common law limitations.&nbsp; An intent to broaden the crime of&nbsp; assault radically cannot be inferred from Parliament‚Äôs removal of the words ‚Äúnature and quality of the act‚Äù.&nbsp; Rather,&nbsp; Parliament must be supposed to have expected that the courts would continue to read the <i>Code</i> provisions on sexual assault against the background of the common law, unless it used language clearly indicating that it was altering the common law.&nbsp; There is nothing in s.&nbsp;265 to indicate such an intention. This conclusion is supported by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-i-21-en#!fragment/sec45subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;45(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-i-21-en" target="_blank">Interpretation Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which provides that an amending enactment shall not be deemed to involve a declaration of a change in the existing law.&nbsp; It is also supported by the rule of construction that where, as here, a criminal statute is ambiguous, the interpretation that favours the accused is preferred.&nbsp; As well, the jurisprudence, without exception, supports the view that Parliament intended to retain the common law definition of fraud for assault.&nbsp; Section 265(3) must, therefore, continue to be read in light of the common law.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">It is an established rule that courts will effect changes to the common law only where those changes are incremental developments of existing principle and where the consequences of the change are contained and predictable. Here,&nbsp; the broad changes proposed&nbsp; to the common law concept of fraud for assault do not fall within this test.&nbsp; Both the application of the commercial concept of fraud, limited by an <i>ad hoc</i> qualifier that there must be a ‚Äúsignificant risk of serious bodily harm‚Äù, and the application of an unqualified view of fraud which includes any deceit inducing consent to contact&nbsp; amount to abandoning the common law rule and substituting new principles in its place.&nbsp; Not only are the proposed extensions of the law sweeping, they are unprecedented. Moreover, the theoretical difficulties with both proposals are matched by the practical problems they would introduce.&nbsp; Parliament is better equipped than the courts to foresee the complex ramifications of such sweeping change and make the necessary value choices.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">It is open, however, for courts to make incremental changes by extending the common law concepts of nature of the act and identity, provided the ramifications of the changes are not overly complex. It is the proper role of the courts to update the common law from time to time to bring it into harmony with the changing needs of society.&nbsp; This applies to the common law concept of fraud in relation to assault. In this case, the current state of the law does not reflect the values of Canadian society.&nbsp; It is unrealistic to think that consent given to sex on the basis that one‚Äôs partner is HIV‚Äëfree stands unaffected by blatant deception on that matter. Where a person represents that he or she is disease‚Äëfree, and consent is given on that basis, deception on that matter goes to the very nature of the sexual act. To say that such a person commits fraud vitiating consent, thereby rendering the contact an assault, seems right and logical. A return to the pre‚Äë<i>Clarence</i> view of the common law&nbsp; that deception as to venereal disease may vitiate consent would catch the conduct here at issue, without permitting people to be convicted of assault for other inducements, and would draw a clear line between criminal and non‚Äëcriminal conduct.&nbsp; This proposed extension of the law is relatively narrow, catching only deceit as to venereal disease where it is established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a high risk of infection and that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the fraud actually induced consent to unprotected sex. This limited change will not have far‚Äëreaching, unforeseeable or undesirable ramifications.&nbsp; The common law should thus be changed to permit deceit as to sexually transmitted disease that induces consent to be treated as fraud vitiating consent under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec265" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;265<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

Boyle, <i>Sexual Assault</i> (1984), at pp.&nbsp;27-29.&nbsp; The amendments were not restricted to merely reclassifying indecent assault and rape as sexual assault, as McLachlin J.&nbsp; implies, but were aimed much more broadly at modernizing and sensitizing the law‚Äôs approach to sexual offences, which are predominantly perpetrated by men against women.&nbsp; Included in the amendments was a provision abrogating the evidentiary rules relating to the doctrine of recent complaint in sexual assault cases (s. 275), a provision stating that corroboration of a complainant‚Äôs testimony is no longer required in such cases in order to secure a conviction (s. 274), provisions restricting the evidentiary uses of a complainant‚Äôs sexual history (s. 276) and sexual reputation (s. 277), and a provision&nbsp; repealing the marital exemption to sexual assault (s. 278).</p>

Burden </i>(1981), 25 C.R.

This divergence illustrates that when judges depart from the rule of incremental change to the common law, they face not only the charge that they are stepping outside the proper constitutional role of the courts, but also the practical problem of finding a new principle to put in place of the existing common law rule.&nbsp; Often the new principle is difficult to find and when found, proves to be an ill fit.&nbsp; This leads to complex ramifications, both on the theoretical and practical level.&nbsp; This case is no exception.</p>

Consequences as serious as these should not turn on the interpretation of vague terms like ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù and ‚Äúserious‚Äù.&nbsp; Finally, Cory J.‚Äôs limitation of the new crime to significant and serious risk of harm amounts to<i> </i>making an<i> ad hoc </i>choice of where the line between lawful conduct and unlawful conduct should be drawn.&nbsp; This Court, <i>per</i> Lamer C.J., has warned that making <i>ad hoc</i> choices is properly the task of the legislatures, not the courts: <i>Schachter v.

D. McGinnis, ‚ÄúLaw and the Leprosies of Lust: Regulating Syphilis and AIDS‚Äù (1990), 22 <i>Ottawa L. Rev.</i> 49, at p. 59.&nbsp; Criminalizing a broad range of HIV related conduct will only impair such efforts.&nbsp; Moreover, because homosexuals, intravenous drug users, sex trade workers, prisoners, and people with disabilities are those most at risk of contracting HIV, the burden of criminal sanctions will impact most heavily on members of these already marginalized groups. The material before the Court suggests that a blanket duty to disclose may drive those with the disease underground:&nbsp; see, for example, R. Elliot, <i>Criminal Law and HIV/AIDS: Final Report</i> (March 1997); J. M.

H. Holland‚Äôs article, ‚ÄúHIV/AIDS and the Criminal Law‚Äù (1994), 36 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 279, at pp.&nbsp;297‚Äë98, raises two important points with regard to the <i>Petrozzi</i> decision.&nbsp; First, neither the Crown nor the defence believed that the issue of fraud arose and both objected when the trial judge introduced it to the jury.&nbsp; The case had proceeded as if it were solely a question of deciding between the complainant‚Äôs claim of rape and the accused‚Äôs position that the act was consensual.&nbsp; It seems questionable whether <i>Petrozzi</i> was the appropriate case for determining the proper interpretation of fraud as it is set out in s.&nbsp;265(3)(<i>c</i>).&nbsp; Second, Craig J.A. in <i>Petrozzi</i> noted at p.&nbsp;542 that there was no policy reason for restricting fraud in assault and sexual assault cases to a case involving the nature and quality of the act.&nbsp; Nonetheless, he concluded that Parliament intended to confirm the old constructions.&nbsp; However, he did not cite a particular authority for that proposition.&nbsp; He wrote:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">I fail to appreciate why, as a matter of policy, we should restrict fraud in so far as it relates to consent in common assault and sexual assault cases to a case involving the nature and quality of the act or to a case involving the identity of the offender.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this belief, I have concluded that in enacting the present s.&nbsp;244, especially s.&nbsp;244(3)(<i>c</i>), Parliament intended to confirm the construction which the courts have placed on the type of fraud which may vitiate consent in sexual cases or assault cases.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
