The complainant told no one about these events for two and a half years.&nbsp; At trial, defence counsel cross‚Äëexamined the complainant,&nbsp; who was 10 years old at the time, on the lengthy delay in reporting the incidents and suggested that she had fabricated the story.&nbsp; The Crown called a child psychologist to testify that a child‚Äôs delay in alleging sexual abuse does not support an inference of falsehood.&nbsp; During a <i>voir dire</i>, the psychologist gave a general explanation applicable to all children that delayed disclosure could occur for a variety of reasons and does not indicate the truth of an allegation.&nbsp; The trial judge admitted the expert evidence and the jury found the accused guilty of sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching. The Court of Appeal held that the expert evidence should not have been admitted because it was neither relevant nor necessary, set aside the verdict&nbsp; for this and other reasons, and ordered a new trial.&nbsp; The Crown appealed from the finding that the expert evidence was inadmissible but agrees that the order for a new trial was warranted based on the Court of Appeal‚Äôs other reasons for setting aside the verdict.&nbsp; On the only issue raised in this appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the expert evidence should not have been admitted.</span></p>

While some degree of deference is owed to the trial judge‚Äôs discretionary determination of whether the <i>Mohan</i> requirements have been met on the facts of a particular case, that discretion cannot be used to dilute the requirement for necessity.&nbsp; Mere helpfulness or a finding that the evidence might reasonably assist the jury is not enough to admit an expert‚Äôs opinion.&nbsp; The need for expert evidence must be assessed in light of its potential to distort the fact‚Äëfinding process.&nbsp; Expert opinion is admissible if exceptional issues require special knowledge outside the experience of the trier of fact.&nbsp; The admissibility requirements governing expert evidence do not eliminate the dangers associated with opinion evidence.&nbsp; In particular, the province of the jury might be usurped by that of the expert witness and jurors might attorn to the opinion of an expert.&nbsp; Furthermore, expert opinions usually are derived from unsworn material not available for cross‚Äëexamination.&nbsp; Finally, expert evidence is time‚Äëconsuming and expensive.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here, one statement of principle emerges from the expert evidence: the timing of disclosure signifies nothing; not all children immediately disclose sexual abuse; and the timing of disclosure depends upon the circumstances of the particular victim.&nbsp; The content of this evidence had no technical quality sufficient to require an expert‚Äôs testimony.&nbsp; It was neither unique nor scientifically puzzling but was rather the proper subject for a simple jury instruction. The doctrine of recent complaint in sexual assault cases as a principle of law no longer exists in Canada and a failure to make a timely complaint must not be the subject of an adverse inference based upon rejected stereotypical assumptions of how persons react to sexual abuse. A trial judge should instruct a jury that there is no inviolable rule on how people who are the victims of trauma like a sexual assault will behave.&nbsp; In assessing the credibility of a complainant, the timing of the complaint is simply one circumstance to consider in the factual mosaic of a particular case.&nbsp; A delay in disclosure, standing alone, will never give rise to an adverse inference against the credibility of the complainant. A proper jury charge in this case would have dispelled the possibility of stereotypical reasoning, saved time and expense, and eliminated superfluous or prejudicial content.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> McLachlin C.J. and L‚ÄôHeureux‚ÄëDub√© and Gonthier JJ. (dissenting on the merits):&nbsp; The psychologist‚Äôs evidence was admissible because it met the test for admitting expert evidence set out in <i>Mohan </i>that requires relevance, necessity, the lack of any other exclusionary rule and a properly qualified expert.&nbsp; Its probative value also outweighed its prejudicial effects. These criteria are case‚Äëspecific and factual.&nbsp; An appellate court cannot lay down broad rules that categories of expert evidence are always admissible or inadmissible and there is no general rule on the admissibility of expert opinion evidence on delays by children in reporting sexual assault. </span></p>

<div class="Section5">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The trial judge was correct in finding that the psychologist‚Äôs evidence was relevant to a fact in issue at the trial.&nbsp; The trial turned on the credibility of the complainant and the issue of delay was subsidiary to the complainant‚Äôs credibility.&nbsp; The ‚Äúfact in issue‚Äù was whether a child‚Äôs delay in reporting sexual abuse suggests that the alleged abuse did not occur.&nbsp; This fact was put in issue by the defence indicating that it would ask the jury to infer that the alleged events were fabrications based on the complainant‚Äôs delayed reporting of the incident. Whether the complainant was not credible because she delayed disclosure was a fact in issue and the psychologist‚Äôs discussion of reasons other than fabrication for a child delaying reporting sexual abuse was relevant to that issue.&nbsp; Further, it is not a persuasive argument that it is common sense inference rather than a fact that a child‚Äôs delay in reporting suggests that the event did not occur.&nbsp; Issues of fact include both facts and logical inferences that may be drawn from facts.&nbsp; Moreover, the evidence did not violate the rule against oath‚Äëhelping because the psychologist did not interview the complainant and did not testify on whether she had told the truth.&nbsp; The evidence did implicate the complainant‚Äôs credibility but this was permissible and almost inevitable in a case that turns on credibility.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">With respect to the necessity requirement, the psychologist‚Äôs evidence provided information likely to be outside the ordinary experience and knowledge of the jury and more than merely helpful.&nbsp; There is still a need to explain children‚Äôs reactions to abuse and it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the psychologist‚Äôs evidence would assist the jurors by giving them an understanding of the issue of delay in reporting that their ordinary knowledge and experience might not provide.&nbsp; There is no need to depart from the flexibility of the <i>Mohan</i> approach by adumbrating the necessity requirement with sub‚Äërules relating to the type of science at issue or with a rule that expert evidence is only needed to explain abnormal behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the fact that the complainant testified did not preclude the psychologist‚Äôs evidence.&nbsp; The defence put the reasons for delay in question and it was open to the trial judge to permit the Crown to respond with evidence of other possible explanations for the delay.&nbsp; Lastly, while the need for expert evidence may be diminished if the same objective can be met with a warning to the jury, a warning in this case would not have been a complete substitute for the psychologist‚Äôs evidence.&nbsp; Expert evidence may serve purposes that instruction does not.</span></p>

L.

24.45pt;line-height:24.4pt">There is a danger that expert evidence will be misused and will distort the fact-finding process.&nbsp; Dressed up in scientific language which the jury does not easily understand and submitted through a witness of impressive antecedents, this evidence is apt to be accepted by the jury as being virtually infallible and as having more weight than it deserves.&nbsp; As La Forest J. stated in <i>R. v. B√©land</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, at p. 434, with respect to the evidence of the results of a polygraph tendered by the accused, such evidence should not be admitted by reason of ‚Äúhuman fallibility in assessing the proper weight to be given to evidence cloaked under the mystique of science‚Äù.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">As the <i>Mohan</i> Court explained, the four-part test serves as recognition of the time and expense that is needed to cope with expert evidence.&nbsp; It exists in appreciation of the distracting and time-consuming thing that expert testimony can become.&nbsp; It reflects the realization that simple humility and a desire to do what is right can tempt triers of fact to defer to what the expert says.&nbsp; It even addresses the fact that with expert testimony, lawyers may be hard-pressed to perform effectively their function of probing and testing and challenging evidence because its subject matter will often pull them beyond their competence, let alone their expertise.&nbsp; This leaves the trier of fact without sufficient information to assess its reliability adequately, increasing the risk that the expert opinion will simply be&nbsp; attorned to.&nbsp; When should we place the legal system and the truth at such risk by allowing expert evidence?&nbsp; Only when lay persons are apt to come to a wrong conclusion without expert assistance, or where access to important information will be lost unless we borrow from the learning of experts.&nbsp; As <i>Mohan</i> tells us, it is not enough that the expert evidence be helpful before we will be prepared to run these risks.&nbsp; That sets too low a standard.&nbsp; It must be necessary.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">By the end of the 1700s, this formal requirement had evolved into a factual presumption.&nbsp; See, e.g.,<i> Hawkins‚Äô Pleas of the Crown</i>, where the author states:&nbsp; ‚ÄúIt is a strong, but not a conclusive, presumption against a woman that she made no complaint in a reasonable time after the fact‚Äù (cited by Hawkins J. in <i>R. v.
