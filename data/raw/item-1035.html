(dissenting in part):&nbsp; There is no reason to interfere with the Court of Appeal's disposition that all the acquittals should be set aside.&nbsp; While the trial judge did not state the specific nature of the difficulty he was having at either the time of the nonsuit motion or subsequently, it is nevertheless clear that the intermittent nature of the hearings had caused him to conclude that he had not been able to acquire a satisfactory appreciation of the complex factual record which was required to decide the matters before him on a sound basis.&nbsp; The persistence of a difficulty is underlined by his reference to it in the strongest terms both when dealing with the motion and three months later by way of preface to his reasons for verdict.&nbsp; The suggestion that the trial judge's recollection improved with the additional lapse of time between the nonsuit motion and the rendering of a verdict is belied by his comment at the latter time that the extended and sporadic nature of the trial had been so extremely unsatisfactory that he gave serious consideration to declaring a mistrial and that his reason for not doing so was undue hardship to the accused.&nbsp; This reason cannot justify rendering a verdict on the basis of a trial that is not fair, be it a conviction or an acquittal.&nbsp; A proper remedy in the event a fair trial cannot be held within a reasonable delay is a stay of proceedings.&nbsp; The fact that the trial judge gave reasons referring to the evidence is not sufficient to allay the concern as to the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; His comments indicate that he did not consider that the fact-gathering process had provided him with an adequate basis for a due consideration of the evidence.&nbsp; There was a variety of testimony and evidence in this case which was necessarily subject to an assessment regarding credibility.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the presence of a statement by the trial judge that the fact‑finding process was inadequate is sufficient grounds for a declaration of a mistrial.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">A trial conducted sporadically over this length of time can only be extremely unsatisfactory to the accused, who has been in custody from the day of his arrest, the 7th of July,&nbsp;1989 and cannot be commensurate with the proper administration of justice.&nbsp; I, from a trial judge's point of view, find such an extended and sporadic trial extremely unsatisfactory.&nbsp; So much so, that I've given serious consideration to declaring a mistrial.&nbsp; However, I'm not going to take that step, since to do so would cause undue hardship to the accused. </span></p>

(3d) 161, Goodman J.A. concluded, at p.&nbsp;169:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">and (at p. 170):</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">I am, however, satisfied that having regard to those statements and the nature of the evidence, the trial cannot be considered to have been a fair one.&nbsp; Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodman&nbsp;J.A. rightly distinguished this case from other appeals which are based on the mere fact of delay or an inference of prejudice which may be drawn from such a fact.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">His use of the word "entirely" leaves the distinct impression that he had a somewhat diminished recollection or appreciation of the evidence except as disclosed by his notes. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The persistence of a difficulty is underlined by his reference to it in the strongest terms both when dealing with the motion for nonsuit and three months later by way of preface to his reasons for verdict.&nbsp; As Major&nbsp;J. mentions, it is speculative to inquire whether the trial judge may have improved his recollection of the facts by reference to notes and transcripts in the period following the hearing of the nonsuit motion.&nbsp; However, the suggestion that the recollection of the trial judge improved with the additional lapse of time between that occasion and the rendering of a verdict is belied by his comment at the latter time that, for him as a judge, the extended and sporadic nature of the trial had been so extremely unsatisfactory that he gave serious consideration to declaring a mistrial and that his reason for not doing so was undue hardship to the accused.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is remarkable that the reason for not declaring a mistrial is not that the trial judge has been able to overcome his difficulties as a judge (this would be the necessary and only valid reason for doing this), but rather concern for causing prejudice to the accused, presumably because a mistrial would lead to a new trial.&nbsp; This reason cannot justify rendering a verdict on the basis of a trial that is not fair, be it a conviction or an acquittal.&nbsp; A proper remedy in the event a fair trial cannot be held within a reasonable delay is a stay of proceedings.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is the fact that the trial judge gave reasons referring to the evidence sufficient to allay the concern as to the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; The value of the reasons is dependent upon the grasp their author has of the evidence and the assessment he can make of it.&nbsp; The judge's comments imply that the deficiency in this respect was such that he would have declared a mistrial but for the prejudice this would cause the accused. &nbsp;This indicates that he was aware that the basis for his decision was flawed though he misapprehended the proper remedy.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty which was encountered by the trial judge, which related to the adequacy of the trial as a process, is very different from the requirement of a properly motivated judgment which was at issue in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, to which Major&nbsp;J. makes reference.&nbsp; In that case, the question which this Court was considering was whether the failure of a trial judge to make reference to each piece of the evidence in the course of giving reasons, among other things, constituted an error of law.&nbsp; Sopinka J. concluded at p.&nbsp;296 that:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">A trial judge must consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue <u>but unless the reasons demonstrate that this was not done</u>, the failure to record the fact of it having been done is not a proper basis for concluding that there was error in law in this respect.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Even though a trial judge need not make reference to all the evidence before him in the course of giving reasons for judgment, the reasons may yet demonstrate that there were significant inadequacies in the fact-finding process which justify the declaration of a mistrial.&nbsp; While the trial judge did give reasons for his conclusions in this case, his comments indicate that he did not consider that the process of fact gathering had provided him with an adequate basis for a due consideration of the evidence.&nbsp; I am, with respect, unable to share the conclusion of Major&nbsp;J. that the trial judge did not indicate in giving his trial verdict his reason why he had considered declaring a mistrial, and that there is no reason to conclude that he was not able to appreciate the evidence.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comments of the trial judge are particularly significant given the nature of the evidence in this case.&nbsp; Apart from the complexity of the factual record, there were a number of issues of credibility which were raised on the evidence.&nbsp; An opportunity to make reference to and consider the totality of the evidence is an important part of any process of the assessment of evidence, and particularly credibility.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstances of this case are different from those which demand an investigation of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence.&nbsp; The issue here is not limited to whether the decision of the trial judge was within the scope of conclusions which the evidence allowed or mandated.&nbsp; Rather, the propriety of the conclusions of the trial judge is closely connected to the question of whether there was a proper consideration of the evidence in the first place.&nbsp; The facts in this case were such that the evidence upon which both the convictions and the acquittals were based was to a significant degree the same.&nbsp; It was correctly noted in the Court of Appeal that the evidence regarding the various counts was interwoven and interdependent, with the result that conclusions based on part of the evidence cannot be isolated from inadequacies in the fact-finding process as a whole.&nbsp; There was a variety of testimony and evidence which was necessarily subject to an assessment regarding credibility.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the presence of a statement by the trial judge that the fact-finding process was inadequate is sufficient grounds for a declaration of a mistrial.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these circumstances, it was appropriate to send the entire matter, including the counts for which an acquittal was entered, back to trial.&nbsp; While the fairness and integrity of the trial process, including the fact-finding process, is a matter of law of concern to both trial and appellate courts, the proper place for the trial is before a trial judge and not in the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Conclusion</span></u></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the statements made by the trial judge, the Court of Appeal correctly understood the position of the trial judge at the time of the consideration of the nonsuit motion and when rendering a verdict.&nbsp; The statements of the trial judge demonstrate not only an inadequacy in the basis for his consideration of the evidence, but also that such an inadequacy was recognized at trial, despite the fact that it was improperly addressed.&nbsp; The importance which was accorded to the statements of the trial judge is consistent with the decision of this Court in <i>Morin</i>, <i>supra</i>, for statements such as that of the trial judge may evidence an inability to consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue.&nbsp; Such a failure cannot be remedied by the provision of a reasoned decision.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
