 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The United Nurses of Alberta went on strike in January, 1988, contrary to directives forbidding the strike made under the Alberta <i>Labour Relations Act</i> and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench.&nbsp; The union was found to be in criminal contempt of the orders and fined $250,000 and $150,000 on successive motions.&nbsp; At trial, the trial judge refused the right to crossâexamine on certain affidavits, on the ground that the accused could not establish in advance that the crossâexamination would be relevant.&nbsp; The Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed its appeal and the union appealed to this Court.&nbsp; The issues were:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;whether the union had the status to be found in criminal contempt; (2)&nbsp;whether the offence of criminal contempt violated the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>; (3)&nbsp;whether a directive of a provincial board filed in the Court could give rise to criminal contempt; and (4)&nbsp;whether the proceedings violated the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> because the union was not permitted to crossâexamine on the affidavits filed by the Crown.</p>

<div class="WordSection4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Denial of liberty resulting from criminal contempt is effected in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.&nbsp; The absence of codification does not in itself violate the principle that there must not be crime or punishment except in accordance with fixed, preâdetermined law.&nbsp; Nor is the crime of criminal contempt so difficult to distinguish from civil contempt that it violates these principles.&nbsp; The distinction between civil and criminal contempt rests in the concept of public defiance that accompanies criminal contempt.&nbsp; To establish criminal contempt the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused defied or disobeyed a court order in a public way (the <i>actus reus</i>), with intent, knowledge or recklessness as to the fact that the public disobedience will tend to depreciate the authority of the court (the <i>mens rea</i>).&nbsp; When the accused must have known his or her act of defiance will be public, it may be inferred that he or she was at least reckless as to whether the authority of the Court would be brought into contempt.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the circumstances leave a reasonable doubt as to whether the breach was or should be expected to have this public quality, then the necessary <i>mens rea</i> would not be present and the accused would be acquitted, even if the matter in fact became public.&nbsp; While publicity is required for the offence, a civil contempt is not converted to a criminal contempt merely because it attracts publicity but rather because it constitutes a public act of defiance of the court in circumstances where the accused knew, intended or was reckless as to the fact that the act would publicly bring the court into contempt.&nbsp; An accused can predict in advance whether his or her conduct will constitute a crime.&nbsp; Criminal contempt does not therefore violate ss.&nbsp;7, 11(<i>a</i>) or (<i>g</i>).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The inability of the judge to inquire into the validity of the order on the contempt proceeding does not deprive him or her of a responsibility which should rest with a s.&nbsp;96 court.&nbsp; The judge must determine whether the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused has breached the directive in a way that amounts to public defiance of the authority of the court and if so, must determine the sentence.&nbsp; A judge entertaining a motion for contempt of an order made by a judge of the court, as opposed to an inferior tribunal, would not have the power to go behind the order for its validity is not an issue on the contempt hearing.&nbsp; Section&nbsp;142(7) cannot insulate an inferior tribunal's decision from scrutiny as an affected party can always challenge the directive of the board on jurisdictional grounds.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Section&nbsp;142(7) does not enable the province to enact criminal law, which is a matter reserved to Parliament.&nbsp; Rather, the provision engages the criminal law, just as it may engage the civil contempt power, but it creates neither.&nbsp; Jurisprudence dealing with similar provisions in labour legislation in Canada has established that, where such Board orders are filed with the court, they have the same force and effect as orders of the court and disobedience can be punished by contempt and other similar proceedings.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The word "enforceable" is not restricted to the civil contempt power and can embrace the criminal contempt power.&nbsp; Words are to be given their plain ordinary meaning in a statute.&nbsp; No dictionary need to be called in aid to demonstrate that the words "enforceable as such" mean that an order of the Labour Relations Board is to be enforced by the court as if it were an order of the court.&nbsp; A directive of the Board can therefore give rise to criminal contempt.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Even assuming that the trial judge, in limiting irrelevant questioning, did not have the discretion to exclude the crossâexamination altogether on the basis that the accused did not prove beforehand that the intended questions were relevant, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Both civil and criminal contempt may apply and attach to the same activity.&nbsp; Contempts tending to bring the administration of justice into scorn or to interfere with the due course of justice are criminal in their nature; contempt in disregarding orders or judgments of a civil court or in not doing something ordered to be done in a cause is not criminal in its nature.&nbsp; The <i>actus reus</i> for the offence of the criminal contempt must be conduct which causes a serious public injury.&nbsp; In the context of a labour dispute that would be conduct which threatens the rule of law.&nbsp; The <i>mens rea</i> is that the perpetrator wilfully or knowingly caused this harm or, alternatively, acted with a reckless disregard that such harm was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the act.</p>

<div class="WordSection7">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">More than public conduct is necessary to transform a defiance of a court order into criminal contempt.&nbsp; To accept public conduct as the standard would replace a functional distinction derived from the separate interests which the law of civil and criminal contempt are designed to protect with an arbitrary distinction based on the public profile of a dispute which has resulted in the breach of a court order.&nbsp; Moreover, making it the sole determining factor would expand the scope of criminal contempt powers far beyond the limits necessary to achieve their end.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The criminal contempt power should be used sparingly, with great restraint and only when required to protect the rule of law.&nbsp; A court's response must be proportionate to the harm caused.&nbsp; If the penalty is of undue severity and disproportionately greater than that which is appropriate then it will diminish rather than enhance respect for the administration of justice.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The unrestrained use of criminal contempt proceedings in labour relations matters may again give rise to the perception that the courts are interfering with the collective bargaining process and intervening on behalf of management.&nbsp; If that perception persists, the courts will no longer be seen as impartial arbiters but as the instruments used by society for imposing crushing penalties on unions and union members.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Alternative methods were available for enforcing compliance with the Board's order.&nbsp; The legislators designed a comprehensive and balanced scheme, which included a graduated system of fines, to deal with any infringement of orders.&nbsp; The use of criminal contempt proceedings and the imposition of crushing penalties were inappropriate except in circumstances of violence or threats of serious violence.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The conduct of the union leadership was not sufficient to transform the civil contempt into criminal contempt.&nbsp; The element of public injury was missing from the breach of the order.&nbsp; The nurses neither flaunted their disobedience of the order nor presented any threat of violence.&nbsp; The diffidence of their spokesperson in discussing the matter with press indicated that the union did not intend to bring the administration of justice into a disrepute or hold it up to scorn.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The criminal law of contempt must be distinguished from civil contempt.&nbsp; Criminal contempt is to punish conduct calculated to bring the administration of justice by the courts into disrepute; civil contempt is to secure compliance with the process of a tribunal including, but not limited to, the process of a court.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">Before jurisdiction to punish for criminal contempt can be found, there must be an act of the court taken in the course of the administration of justice.&nbsp; The alleged contemnor cannot bring the administration of justice by the courts into disrepute if the order which has been disobeyed is not in fact an order of the court but that of an inferior tribunal.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The leading Canadian case on this issue is <i>Poje v. Attorney General for British Columbia</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;516.&nbsp; There, Kellock J. examined the English jurisprudence which considered the distinction between the two types of contempt.&nbsp; He cited <i>Scott v. Scott</i>, [1913] A.C.&nbsp;419 (H.L.), as authority for the proposition that mere disobedience of a Court Order is not necessarily criminal.&nbsp; He noted at p.&nbsp;520 that ". . . it may be so, depending upon the nature and quality of the conduct involved".&nbsp;&nbsp; Kellock J., at p.&nbsp;522,&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; Oswald's treatise <i>Contempt of Court</i>, 3rd ed., at p. 36, as setting out the critical factor which transforms disobedience of the court order into criminal contempt, particularly the following paragraph:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:31.65pt;text-indent:25.95pt;line-height:
24.4pt">And, generally, the distinction between contempts criminal and not criminal seems to be that contempts which tend to bring the administration of justice into scorn, or which tend to interfere with the due course of justice, are criminal in their nature; but that contempt in disregarding orders or judgments of a Civil Court or in not doing something ordered to be done in a cause, is not criminal in its nature.&nbsp; In other words, where contempt involved a <i>public</i> injury or offence, it is criminal in its nature, and the proper remedy is committal--but where the contempt involves a private injury only it is not criminal in its nature.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The distinction drawn by Oswald makes eminently good sense.&nbsp; The purpose of the criminal law is to protect society whereas the civil law regulates and facilitates private relationships.&nbsp; The sole reason for the existence of a separate category of criminal contempt is to answer the need to discourage and to punish those acts which occasion serious injuries to the public interest.&nbsp; Where the injury caused by disobedience to an order is private in nature, the civil contempt powers suffice.&nbsp; In order to determine whether by their conduct individuals are subject to criminal contempt, the court should ask:&nbsp; who has been injured and what are the extent of the injuries caused by the contumacious conduct?</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">In <i>Poje</i> the contempt proceedings arose from actions taken by union members during a strike involving the International Wood Workers of America.&nbsp; The strikers were striving to prevent the loading of lumber at the docks.&nbsp; To that end they formed picket lines at the dock entrance to discourage the longshoremen from loading a ship with the lumber.&nbsp; An <i>ex parte</i> injunction against the union had been obtained restraining it from obstructing access to the ship.&nbsp; Nonetheless, large numbers of men persisted in blocking the dock entrance.&nbsp; At the contempt hearings the defendants argued that their purpose was simply to communicate information, not to obstruct access to the docks.&nbsp; Kellock J. rejected this rather incredible explanation.&nbsp; He found, at p. 526, that:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The congregation of the large numbers of men at the times that the longshoremen were to arrive had no other object or effect than to present force.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">It can be seen that Kellock J. was convinced, on the basis of the facts presented, that the picketers presented a very real threat of violence.&nbsp; It was the imminent threat of violent action undertaken by a large number of men in very public defiance of a court order which transformed the breach of the injunction into actionable criminal contempt.&nbsp; He concluded, at p.&nbsp;527, that:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:31.65pt;text-indent:25.95pt;line-height:
12.2pt">The context in which these incidents occurred, the large numbers of men involved and the <i>public</i> nature of the defiance of the order of the court transfer the conduct here in question from the realm of a mere civil contempt, such as an ordinary breach of injunction with respect to private rights in a patent or trade-mark, for example, into the realm of a public depreciation of the authority of the court tending to bring the administration of justice into scorn.&nbsp; It is to be observed that the nuisance created by the incidents referred to brought the appellants within the scope of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec501" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;501<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> . . . .&nbsp; Over and above these offences, however, the character of the conduct involved a public injury amounting to criminal contempt.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">Of paramount concern to Kellock J. in reaching this conclusion was the context in which the impugned conduct took place and the public character of the injury.&nbsp; These were the factors he took into account in classifying the activity as criminal contempt.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">Penal sanctions should be reserved for very serious cases and used with moderation in order to reaffirm fundamental values solemnly.&nbsp; Criminal law must thus set tolerance thresholds.&nbsp; In matters of contempt, these thresholds must be established on the basis of the values to be protected, and must take into account the fact that civil contempt is often sufficient to reaffirm the values contravened, or to restore peace, efficacy and impartiality to a situation jeopardized by the act of an individual.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">I agree that criminal contempt power should be used sparingly, with great restraint and only in those circumstances when it is required to protect the rule of law.&nbsp; The response of the court to a party in defiance of its order must be proportionate to the harm caused.&nbsp; If the penalty is of undue severity and disproportionately greater than that which is appropriate then it will diminish rather than enhance respect for the administration of justice.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The unrestrained use of criminal contempt proceedings in labour relations matters will once again give rise to the perception that the courts are interfering with the collective bargaining process and intervening on behalf of management.&nbsp; If that perception persists, the courts will no longer be seen as impartial arbiters but as the instruments used by society for imposing crushing penalties on unions and union members.&nbsp; In her dissenting judgment in the Alberta Court of Appeal (1990), 73&nbsp;Alta. L.R. (2d) 152, Veit J.A. was aware of this danger and rightly recognized that it would be "unseemly" for the courts to utilize criminal contempt in these situations.</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The union's first position is that all uncodified common law crimes are unconstitutional.&nbsp; It is a fundamental principle of justice, it submits, that all crimes must be codified.&nbsp; Criminal contempt, although mentioned in s.&nbsp;9 of the <i>Code</i>, is not codified, both its <i>actus reus</i> and <i>mens rea</i> being defined at common law.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">We were referred to no authority in support of the proposition that fundamental justice requires codification of all crimes.&nbsp; The union cites the principle that there must be no crime or punishment except in accordance with fixed, preâdetermined law.&nbsp; But the absence of codification does not mean that a law violates this principle.&nbsp; For many centuries, most of our crimes were uncodified and were not viewed as violating this fundamental rule.&nbsp; Nor, conversely, is codification a guarantee that all is made manifest in the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; Definition of elements of codified crimes not infrequently requires recourse to common law concepts:&nbsp; see <i>R. v. Jobidon</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714, where the majority of this Court, <i>per</i> Gonthier J., noted the important role the common law continues to play in the criminal law.&nbsp; The union also relies on the fact that this Court has said it is for Parliament, not the courts, to create new offences:&nbsp; <i>Frey v. Fedoruk</i>, [1950] S.C.R. 517, s.&nbsp;9 of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; But this does not mean that the courts should refuse to recognize the common law crime of contempt of court which preâdated codification and which is expressly preserved by s.&nbsp;9 of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; I conclude that lack of codification in itself does not render the common law crime of criminal contempt of court unconstitutional.</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The next argument is that the crime of criminal contempt is so vague and difficult to apply that it violates the fundamental principle of justice that the law should be fixed, preâdetermined and accessible and understandable by the public.&nbsp; This argument focuses on the alleged impossibility of distinguishing between civil and criminal contempt.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">It is my view that a clear distinction exists between civil and criminal contempt and that the law of criminal contempt is sufficiently certain to meet the requirements of fundamental justice.&nbsp; The distinction between civil and criminal contempt rests in the concept of public defiance that accompanies criminal contempt.</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">Both civil and criminal contempt of court rest on the power of the court to uphold its dignity and process.&nbsp; The rule of law is at the heart of our society; without it there can be neither peace, nor order nor good government.&nbsp; The rule of law is directly dependent on the ability of the courts to enforce their process and maintain their dignity and respect.&nbsp; To maintain their process and respect, courts since the 12th century have exercised the power to punish for contempt of court.</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">These same courts found it necessary to distinguish between civil and criminal contempt.&nbsp; A person who simply breaches a court order, for example by failing to abide by visiting hours stipulated in a child custody order, is viewed as having committed civil contempt.&nbsp; However, when the element of public defiance of the court's process in a way calculated to lessen societal respect for the courts is added to the breach, it becomes criminal.&nbsp; This distinction emerges from <i>Poje v. Attorney General for British Columbia</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 516, at p.&nbsp;527, per Kellock J.:</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">What the courts have fastened on in this and other cases where criminal contempt has been found is the concept of public defiance that "transcends the limits of any dispute between particular litigants and constitutes an affront to the administration of justice as a whole":&nbsp; <i>B.C.G.E.U. v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;237, per Dickson C.J., Lamer, Wilson, La&nbsp;Forest, and L'HeureuxâDubÃ© JJ. concurring.&nbsp; The gravamen of the offence is not actual or threatened injury to persons or property; other offences deal with those evils.&nbsp; The gravamen of the offence is rather the open, continuous and flagrant violation of a court order without regard for the effect that may have on the respect accorded to edicts of the court.</p>

Attorney General of Quebec</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 220, this Court held that a legislature could not insulate the decisions of a provincial tribunal from judicial review, with the result that an affected party can always challenge the directive of the board directly on jurisdictional grounds.&nbsp; I note that the judge hearing the motion for contempt can decline to deal with the matter until the review proceedings are completed, thereby avoiding the danger of a finding of criminal contempt based on an invalid order.&nbsp; In this case, the judge refused the motion to adjourn pending judicial review of the Board's order, but nothing was made of this on appeal.</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">Another way of looking at the matter is to ask whether s.&nbsp;142(7) offends because it permits a superior court to enforce orders other than its own.&nbsp; In a sense, the superior court is not merely enforcing the order of the tribunal; it is also finding a criminal offence to have been made out.&nbsp; But accepting that it is merely enforcing the tribunal order, this amounts not to a diminution of the superior court's powers, but rather a grant to it of additional powers.&nbsp; Nor is anything taken from the inferior tribunal which does not have the power of enforcement by contempt.</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">In fact, resort to courts of inherent jurisdiction to assist in the enforcement of orders of inferior tribunals has a long and respectable history.&nbsp; It has been held that a superior court can protect the inferior court against <i>ex facie</i> contempt:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Parke</i>, [1903] 2 K.B. 432, <i>R. v. Davies</i>, [1906] 1 K.B. 32.&nbsp; The validity of a provision in the Saskatchewan <i>Trade Union Act</i> making orders of the Board "enforceable as orders of the Court of King's Bench" was upheld by the Privy Council:&nbsp; <i>Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Ironworks, Ltd.</i>, [1949] A.C. 134 (P.C.).&nbsp; Finally, in <i>Tomko v. Labour Relations Board (N.S.)</i>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 112, this Court upheld a provision of the Nova Scotia <i>Trade Union Act</i>, S.N.S. 1972, c.&nbsp;19, allowing the Labour Relations Board to make cease and desist orders, the penalty for breach of which could be imposed only by the courts.&nbsp; In affirming the constitutionality of this scheme Laskin C.J., for the majority of the Court, held that it was equivalent to an earlier scheme identical to the one at issue in the present case, thus implicitly affirming the constitutionality of a scheme in which orders of the Board are filed with the court and are enforceable as orders of the court.</p>

British Columbia (Attorney General)</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214,&nbsp; <i>R. v. Hill</i> (1976), 73 D.L.R. (3d) 621 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 629, <i>Poje v.

Quebec Police Commission</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 618.&nbsp; Legislation that purports to extend the criminal contempt power must be strictly construed and the legislation must make it clear that it is to apply to the orders under consideration.&nbsp; See <i>Re Ajax &amp; Pickering General Hospital and Canadian Union of Public Employees</i> (1981), 132 D.L.R. (3d) 270 (Ont.&nbsp;C.A.), <i>Attorney General v. British Broadcasting Corp.</i>, [1980] 3 All E.R. 161.&nbsp; Moreover, the principle that ambiguity should be resolved in favour of those sought to punished applies <i>a fortiori</i>.&nbsp; It follows from the foregoing that, before jurisdiction to punish for criminal contempt can be found, there must be an act of the court taken in the course of the administration of justice.&nbsp; The alleged contemnor can hardly be said to bring the administration of justice by the courts into disrepute if the order which has been disobeyed is not in fact an order of the court but that of an inferior tribunal.</p>

text-indent:31.65pt;line-height:24.4pt">The effect of the position contended for by the respondent and maintained by the Court of Appeal is that provincial legislation can provide that an order which remains an order of the Board can be the subject of criminal contempt proceedings.&nbsp; A province could thus provide that disobedience of an order of an administrative tribunal <i>ex facie</i> the tribunal is a criminal offence.&nbsp; Since no such offence existed nor exists at common law, this interpretation would enable the province to enact criminal law, a matter reserved to Parliament.&nbsp; Such an interpretation should not be adopted unless the language is incapable of a meaning that conforms to the powers of a province.&nbsp; This principle of interpretation was adopted in <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Quebec Police Commission</i>, <i>supra</i>, where Beetz&nbsp;J. stated, at pp.&nbsp;641-42:</p>

Co. v. City of Toronto</i> (1920), 51 D.L.R. 69, at p. 73, Viscount Cave observed that it may, according to its context, refer to penalties such as a fine for the purpose of punishment or to some process for procuring specific performance.&nbsp; When used in the latter sense a fine or other penalty may be employed to induce obedience.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that its use in this section was intended in the latter sense to enable measures to be taken to secure compliance rather than in the criminal law sense emphasizing punishment.&nbsp; This was the interpretation placed upon similar language by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in <i>Citation Industries Ltd. v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local 1928</i> (1988), 53 D.L.R. (4th) 360 (B.C.C.A.).&nbsp; At page&nbsp;365, Seaton J.A. stated:</p>

Skurjat</i>, [1966] 2 O.R. 547, aff'd [1967] 1 O.R. 609.&nbsp; A number of labour leaders were jailed for contempt of a court injunction.&nbsp; The Act specifically preserved this right in s.&nbsp;142(7.2) (added by S.A. 1983, c. 34, s. 2(33)).&nbsp; In the rare case in which it is desirable to resort to criminal sanctions in a labour dispute, proceedings can be taken by way of court injunction.&nbsp; This suggests that there is no reason to extend the use of the criminal contempt power to enforce directives of the Board.</p>
