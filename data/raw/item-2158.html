 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The fact that an accused possessed a weapon for a defensive purpose is not itself determinative of guilt or innocence under s. 88, and it is also clear that actual use of a weapon in a manner which is dangerous to the public peace does not establish that the weapon was possessed for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.&nbsp; Where an accused is found to have possessed a weapon for a defensive purpose, it is only where the attack is completely inescapable that possession of a weapon to thwart the attack is not possession for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.&nbsp; Many indicia will be relevant to this determination of avoidability, including location, atmosphere, nature of the threat, imminence of danger, and actual use.&nbsp; A finding that the accused actually used his weapon in a manner which constituted justifiable self-defence is relevant under s.&nbsp;88, but not sufficient for an acquittal thereunder.&nbsp; It is relevant insofar as it may reveal both whether the accused’s subjective purpose was truly to defend himself and whether, in the circumstances, the attack was escapable.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">In this case, the Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the acquittal on the charge of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.&nbsp; On the day of the altercation, the accused possessed his weapon for the purpose of defending himself against an imminent attack by specific individuals.&nbsp; His purpose was not, in all the circumstances, dangerous to the public peace, since the attack was clearly unavoidable.&nbsp; The accused was subject to specific credible threats of an imminent assault, in an environment from which there was simply no possibility of escape and in which it was futile to seek protection.&nbsp; It is also particularly relevant that the trial judge specifically found that the accused’s actual use of the weapon constituted justifiable self‑defence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The Court of Appeal also erred in holding that “the dangerous purpose requirement of s.&nbsp;88 is found in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec90" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;90<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>”.&nbsp; Although concealment is the determinative factor under s.&nbsp;90, it is but one relevant factor under s.&nbsp;88.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal effectively replaced the requirement that the purpose be dangerous with the requirement that the purpose be unlawful.</p>

24.4pt">Under s. 88(1), an accused’s subjective purpose must be one that is dangerous to the public peace.&nbsp; To avoid importing an objective element into a purely subjective approach, the concept of a “purpose dangerous to the public peace” needs to be given concrete content.&nbsp; Within the meaning of s. 88(1), it is the possession of a weapon with the intention of doing harm to persons or property, or showing reckless disregard for harm to persons or property.&nbsp; Section 88(1) does not require actual use of the weapon, but does require possession of a weapon coupled with an additional intention.</p>

24.4pt">Here, the elements of s. 88(1) have been established.&nbsp; The accused possessed the “shanks” for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, since he intended to use them to harm another person or persons.&nbsp; Self-defence does not negate the <i>mens rea</i> of s.&nbsp;88(1); rather it is a justification for conduct that would otherwise attract criminal liability.&nbsp; An accused can be excused from criminal liability under s.&nbsp;88(1) where possession of a weapon is necessary for defending himself.&nbsp; On the facts of this case, the defence of necessity is made out.&nbsp; The accused possessed the weapons to defend himself against an imminent attack and had a reasonable belief that the circumstances afforded him no legal way out; also, the harm he sought to avoid outweighed the breach of s.&nbsp;88(1).</p>

Taking all of the evidence into account, he concluded that the accused had the weapon in his possession “to deter first strike and defend against it should it become necessary”.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the acquittal.&nbsp; It found the accused guilty under s. 88, the offence with which he was charged, because he had in its view committed an offence under s.&nbsp;90 (carrying a concealed weapon) with which he was never charged.&nbsp; Morever, in dealing with the critical issue of the accused’s purpose in possessing the weapon, the court impermissibly substituted its own view of the evidence for the opposite finding of the trial judge, holding that “[the accused’s] decision to conceal his weapons evidences [his] choice of reprisal over deterrence”.&nbsp; These errors are fatal to the Court of Appeal’s decision.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The dangerous weapon charge relates only to January 16, 2000.&nbsp; But in determining his purpose on that day it is relevant to take into consideration his general <i>modus operandi</i> as part of the factual context.&nbsp; The evidence makes it clear that the accused would have been carrying his knife on the day of the incident irrespective of the threats.&nbsp; As on every other day, he was in possession of a dangerous weapon within a prison culture of violence for the purpose of self-help through the infliction of injury or death.&nbsp; The argument that violent self-help in breach of the peace can be justified as a “necessity” has been rejected since medieval times as inimical to public order and should not be given new credence today.</p>

Cassidy</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 351, this Court set out the two elements which the Crown must prove in order to establish guilt on a charge of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">Section 85 requires proof of possession and proof that the purpose of that possession was one dangerous to the public peace.&nbsp; There must at some point in time be a meeting of these two elements.&nbsp; Generally, the purpose will have been formed prior to the taking of possession and will continue as possession is taken.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Thus, the Crown must establish (i) that the accused possessed a weapon, and (ii) that the purpose of that possession was one dangerous to the public peace.&nbsp; The offence is qualified in the doctrine as a specific intent crime since “the prohibited conduct [must] be committed with an intent to achieve a particular result”: see D. Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal Law:&nbsp; A Treatise</i> (4th ed. 2001), at p. 236.&nbsp; In the present case,&nbsp; there is no issue as to possession; we are concerned squarely with the question of purpose.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">Although it is firmly established in law that the element of intent or <i>mens rea</i> must be present for there to be an offence, it does not necessarily follow that a person’s initial intent when he takes possession of a weapon governs throughout his possession.&nbsp; A person’s intent does not necessarily remain constant and may change to a dangerous intent even though the initial purpose in taking possession was not a dangerous one.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">There must be, at some point, a meeting of the elements of possession and of a purpose dangerous to the public peace.</p>

Hibbert</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, the term “purpose” is capable of two different meanings: purpose as “intention” or purpose as “desire”.&nbsp; In that case, the court concluded that, for the purposes of s. 21(1)(<i>b</i>) of the <i>Code</i>, the former definition should be adopted: “a person who consciously performs an act knowing the consequences that will (with some degree of certainty) flow from it ‘intends’ these consequences or causes them ‘on purpose’, regardless of whether he or she desired them” (para. 29).&nbsp;</p>

Théroux</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5.&nbsp; The distinction between a subjective substantive standard and an objective approach to proof is well settled.&nbsp; As stated in <i>Nelson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 31:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The similarity in the wording of this provision to that at issue — “for any purpose prejudicial” versus “for a purpose dangerous” — is readily apparent.&nbsp; On the meaning of the term “purpose”, Lord Devlin stated at p. 155:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">I shall begin by considering the word “purpose”, for both sides have relied on this word in different senses.&nbsp; Broadly, the appellants contend that it is to be given a subjective meaning and the Crown an objective one.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">I have no doubt that it is subjective.&nbsp; A purpose must exist in the mind.&nbsp; It cannot exist anywhere else.&nbsp; The word can be used to designate either the main object which a man wants or hopes to achieve by the contemplated act, or it can be used to designate those objects which he knows will probably be achieved by the act, whether he wants them or not.&nbsp; I am satisfied that in the criminal law in general, and in this statute in particular, its ordinary sense is the latter one.&nbsp; In the former sense it cannot in practice be distinguished from motive which is normally irrelevant in criminal law.&nbsp; Its use in that sense would make this statute quite inept.&nbsp; As my noble and learned friend L<span style="font-size:10.0pt;text-transform:uppercase">ORD</span> R<span style="font-size:10.0pt">EID</span> pointed out during the argument, a spy could secure an acquittal by satisfying the jury that his purpose was to make money for himself, a purpose not in itself prejudicial to the state, and that he was indifferent to all the other consequences of his acts.&nbsp; <u>Accordingly, all the results which a man appreciates will probably flow from his act are classifiable as “purposes” within the meaning of s. 1: and since the statute refers to “any purpose”, the prosecution is entitled to rely on any of them. The next question then is whether the selected purpose is “prejudicial” or not and that question is in my opinion to be answered objectively<i>.</i></u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

Vandooren</i>, [1969] 4 C.C.C. 217, the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that “the crucial question [is] whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the intention of using the rifle for a purpose dangerous to the public peace” (p. 220).&nbsp; I cannot understand how LeBel J. reads&nbsp; this extract otherwise than as simply begging the question.</p>

Felawka</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 199, at pp. 214-15, regarding concealed weapons:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">All Canadians have the right to feel protected from the sinister menace of a concealed weapon.&nbsp; If it was ever thought that it was lawful to carry concealed weapons more and more Canadians might come to believe it would be prudent for them to carry concealed weapons in order to defend themselves and their families.&nbsp; This might lead to a vigilante attitude that could all too readily result in an increase in violence in Canadian society.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In this case, the result is mandated only by the fact that the accusation is made in respect of a particular incident, following credible threats of an imminent danger, and where the danger simply could not be avoided.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">. . . there is no doubt that Mr. Kerr possessed weapons.&nbsp; He possessed them regularly, <u>and on the occasion of January 16th, his possession appears to have been in part part of his usual practice</u> and part preparation for possible defence against aggression.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The appellant’s apprehension of a fight with Joseph Garon on January 16 provided <i>one </i>purpose, but this has to be seen in the context of the appellant’s more general “purpose” of carrying his weapon on this as on every other morning of his prison life, subjectively contemplating the use of the “shank” in the violent resolution of disputes within the prison population.&nbsp; The charge relates only to January 16, 2000.&nbsp; But in determining his purpose <i>on that day</i> it is relevant to take into consideration his general <i>modus operandi</i> as part of the factual context:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Nelson</i> (1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 29 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 32; <i>R. v. Knudsen</i> (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 576 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 583.&nbsp; In my view, this broader context demonstrates “a” prohibited purpose within <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec88" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;88<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; This appeal therefore raises a more general question about the lawfulness of prisoners carrying weapons inside a maximum security institution.&nbsp;</p>

When it has to be proved, it is to be proved in the same way as other objective facts are proved. A jury must consider the whole of the evidence relevant to it as a fact in issue. If an accused gives evidence of what his intentions were, the jury must weigh his testimony along with whatever inference as to his intentions can be drawn from his conduct or from other relevant facts. References to a “subjective test” could lead to an idea that the evidence of an accused man as to his intent is more credible than his evidence of other matters. It is not: he may or may not be believed by the jury. Whatever he says, they may be able to conclude from the whole of the evidence that beyond doubt he had a guilty mind and a guilty purpose.

24.4pt">In accordance with well‑established principles for the determination of criminal liability, recklessness, to form a part of the criminal <i>mens rea</i>, must have an element of the subjective. It is found in the attitude of one who, aware that there is danger that his conduct could bring about the result prohibited by the criminal law, nevertheless persists, despite the risk. It is, in other words, the conduct of one who sees the risk and who takes the chance. It is in this sense that the term ‘recklessness’ is used in the criminal law and it is clearly distinct from the concept of civil negligence.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Criminal liability under s. 88(1) thus applies not only to an accused who intends to do harm to persons or property, but also an accused who is aware of a risk of harm to persons or property and persists with his or her intention despite that risk.&nbsp; It does not establish an objective standard of dangerousness however.</p>

If, on the other hand, O’Halloran, J.A. intended to give to the expression a more limited meaning so that it would include only conduct of a nature likely to lead to a breach of the peace in the narrower sense of which he speaks, the authorities referred to elsewhere in this Judgment seem to me to show that this is not an offence known to the law.</p>

Hibbert</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, at para. 47.&nbsp; I would go further than this and add that properly conceived it is <u>necessity</u> and not self-defence that would be available to an accused as a defence under s. 88(1).</p>

The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, at pp. 251-52.</p>

In <i>Perka</i>,<i> supra</i>, the harm inflicted was the defendants coming ashore with their cargo of cannabis, in other words, their breach of the prohibitions on importation of cannabis into Canada and possession of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.&nbsp; This breach had to be weighed against facing death at sea.</p>
