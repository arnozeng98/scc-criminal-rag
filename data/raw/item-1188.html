(dissenting):&nbsp; While questions from the jury merit a full, careful and correct response, it is a settled principle that the main charge and the recharge must be read as a whole in determining whether the trial judge misdirected the jury.&nbsp; The task of the Court of Appeal is to determine whether the jury might have been misled by the alleged error, taking into account all relevant circumstances.&nbsp; In this case any error in the recharge could not be saved by the fact that the judge had correctly charged the jury in the first instance, since the recharge was in answer to a question, which may heighten its significance, and it came some hours after the main charge.&nbsp; The trial judge did not err, however, in recharging the jury.&nbsp; He told the jury several times during the recharge that it could only conclude that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt after weighing all of the evidence.&nbsp; In other words, the jury could not resolve the case simply by deciding whether it believed the complainant or the accused.&nbsp; Since the only witnesses were the complainant and the accused, the trial judge did not err in indicating that total rejection of all the accused's evidence, coupled with acceptance of the complainant's evidence, would leave no evidence upon which a reasonable doubt could be based.&nbsp; As well, the trial judge expressly told the jury that their task was not concluded if they rejected the accused's evidence, as they had to go on to ask themselves the further question of whether they entertained a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Provided that the jury was clearly advised that the case was not a simple credibility contest and that after having considered all the evidence it must consider whether it was left with any reasonable doubt, mention of the competing versions before the jury was not in error.</span></p>

Gibson, "The Liars' Defence" (1993), 20 C.R. (4th) 96; A. D. Gold, "The `Average, Nervous, Inadequate, Inarticulate, in Short, Typical' Accused's Defence" (1993), 22 C.R. (4th) 253; J. L. Gibson, "Misquote Changes Meaning" (1994), 24 C.R. (4th) 395; and A. D. Gold, "Typo Does Not Change Anything" (1994), 24 C.R. (4th) 397.&nbsp; It has been suggested that if one rejects the evidence of the accused, it is logically inconsistent to have a reasonable doubt with respect to it.&nbsp; Such a doubt, it is argued, would not be reasonable.&nbsp; Certainly if the jury rejected (as opposed to merely being undecided about) <u>all</u> of the evidence of the accused, it is difficult to see how that very evidence, having been rejected, could raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; However, a jury could reject part of the evidence of the accused and still reasonably entertain a doubt as to his guilt based on other parts of the accused's evidence, which the jury did not reject, but either accepted or was undecided about.&nbsp; It is in the latter sense that I read the second condition of Cory J.&nbsp; I note also that immediately preceding his three-part statement of the rule, Cory J. states the rule in two branches, rolling the second and third branch of the three-part statement into one (at p. 757):</span></p>

(D.) </i>test should be phrased, it would be wrong to reverse a conviction merely because a particular formula was not repeated verbatim.&nbsp; We must remember that jurors are laypeople, not lawyers, and do not hear and interpret each and every word of the judge's charge with all the legal baggage that a career in the law may engender.&nbsp; An overly legalistic focus on the strict text of the judge's charge does not take this courtroom reality into account, nor accommodate the fact that the judge may have to formulate his or her remarks in various ways in order to make the jury understand that it must acquit regardless of what evidence it may accept or reject if it is left with a reasonable doubt when considering that evidence as a whole.&nbsp; What is required, to quote Sopinka J. in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 362, is that the "charge alerts [the jury] to the fact that, if the defence evidence leaves them in a state of doubt after considering it in the context of the whole of the evidence, then they are to acquit".</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">While the last sentence in this passage at first glance seems to contradict the second and/or third branch of Cory J.'s three-part test in <i>W. (D.)</i>, it was not incorrect on the facts of this case.&nbsp; Since the only witnesses were the complainant and the accused, total rejection of all the accused's evidence coupled with acceptance of the complainant's evidence would leave <u>no evidence</u> upon which a reasonable doubt could be based.&nbsp; Any doubt would not be founded on the evidence and would therefore be unreasonable.&nbsp; So this aspect of the trial judge's instruction was not in error.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Admittedly, there is no way of knowing for sure the impression left on the jury by these portions of the recharge.&nbsp; On balance, however, when the actual remarks are placed in the context of the totality of the judge's recharge, I would lean towards saying that the impression left on the jury was consistent with the words actually used in the judge's recharge and not with the possible interpretation raised by Cory J.</span></p>
