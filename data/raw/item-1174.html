However, this consent was given while the respondent was detained, in circumstances in which he had not been informed adequately of the reason for his detention, in which his right to counsel had not been reiterated in light of the change in focus of the investigation and where, according to Constable Roberts' evidence, the accused did not know that the request for the blood sample was linked to the senior citizen's home investigation.&nbsp; In short, the accused consented after his <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights arising upon detention had been violated.&nbsp; I do not think those violations, as a general proposition, render a search unlawful or unreasonable. However, they do have that effect in particular situations. &nbsp;A case, such as the present one, <u>in which the lawfulness of the search depends upon the accused's consent is one such situation.</u></span></p>

This is not a situation in which the police have a ready alternative of obtaining a warrant. There is no statutory authority for such a warrant in a case of this sort.&nbsp; Even if there were, there is little in the record to show that the police could have demonstrated reasonable and probable cause to obtain one.&nbsp; The decision to give or refuse the sample is a significant decision for an accused person.&nbsp; Counsel has an important role in advising a client as to giving or withholding consent: see, e.g., <i>R. v. Ross</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 13.&nbsp; The accused and his or her counsel are entitled to make that decision in the light of being informed about the real reason for the detention. A consent given where both the right to be informed of the charge and of the right to counsel have been violated is not a valid consent.&nbsp; As I said for the majority in <i>R. v.

The law recognizes some protected situations, such as where compelled testimony cannot be used against the witness in other proceedings.&nbsp; But generally speaking, once the decision to speak is made, the evidence so obtained is admissible if relevant.&nbsp; I am far from convinced that the same general principle should not operate with respect to consent to provide blood samples in the criminal law context.&nbsp; We do not give effect to the individual's desire to speak on condition that what is said is helpful to his or her case.&nbsp; Likewise, I do not think we should open the door to conditional or limited consents in the criminal law context.</span></p>

Moreover, where the blood sample has been properly obtained for a medical purpose, the police will usually have the option of seeking prior judicial authorization to seize the sample. The consent relates to taking the sample from the body.&nbsp; Once the sample is in existence, the results of its analysis may be obtained upon suitable prior judicial authorization.&nbsp; The context is quite different in a case such as the present one.&nbsp; The consent is elicited in the criminal law context and for law enforcement purposes.&nbsp; There is no confusion between medical treatment and criminal investigation.&nbsp; There will often be no alternative investigative technique available in absence of consent.&nbsp; Without the blood sample in this case, as Constable Roberts conceded in cross-examination, there was no other evidence. This is not to say that any and all techniques are permitted to get evidence when it is otherwise hard to come by.&nbsp; It is to point out that balancing the reasonable expectation of privacy and the needs of law enforcement must take account of the context and circumstances in the particular situation.</span></p>

Mellenthin,</i> [1992] 3 S.C.R. 615, the appellant argued that the proper test for determining whether a person has consented to the taking of an item by the state was one of voluntariness, akin to the standard applied when the admissibility of a confession is in issue.&nbsp; Second, the appellant argued that, even if the test for the waiver by an accused of his or her s. 8 right </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">is identical to that used to determine whether there has been a valid waiver of the rights found in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec10" target="_blank">s. 10<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, such that some awareness of the consequences of the waiver is required, this threshold is met on the facts of this case.&nbsp; I will consider each of these submissions in turn.</span></p>

(as he then was) in <i>R. v. Debot,</i> [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, that, while as a general rule a lawful search of the person did not have to be suspended pending exercise of the detainee's right to counsel, an exception existed in cases where the search required the detainee's consent.&nbsp; It is also implicit in the decisions of this Court in <i>Dyment</i>, <i>supra</i>, and in <i>R. v. Colarusso</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 20, at p. 55, which recognize that a consent to the taking of blood can be limited to a taking for certain purposes only.&nbsp; This concept reveals a link between the scope of a valid consent and the scope of the accused's knowledge in relation to the consequences of that consent.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

In the absence of prior judicial authorization, a search or seizure will be unreasonable unless it is authorized by law, the law itself is reasonable and the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278; and <i>R. v. Wiley</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 263.&nbsp; The seizure in this case was not lawful.&nbsp; There is no statutory authorization available for the seizure of a blood sample in relation to the offence of sexual assault.&nbsp; A lawful seizure in this case required the respondent's consent.&nbsp; For the foregoing reasons, I find that consent to be absent.</span></p>

I add that to hold otherwise leaves open the possibility of police manipulation, whereby the police -- hoping to question a suspect in a serious crime without the suspect's lawyer present -- bring in the suspect on a relatively minor offence, one for which a person may not consider it necessary to have a lawyer immediately present, in order to question him or her on the more serious crime.</span></p>

(as he then was) in <i>R. v. Collins</i>, <i>supra</i>, namely:&nbsp; the effect of the admission of the evidence on the fairness of the trial; the seriousness of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> violations; and the effect of the exclusion of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice.&nbsp; The majority considered the nature of the evidence and the point in time at which it came into existence, and concluded that the admission of the results of the DNA analysis of the blood sample would render the trial unfair.&nbsp; Their reasons in this regard are not in error.&nbsp; </span></p>

Elshaw</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 24, in which it was held that, while the bad faith of the police would operate to strengthen the case for exclusion, the good faith of police could not support the admission of evidence in circumstances where that admission had been found to render the trial unfair.</span></p>

Evans</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869, at pp. 892-93, is whether the new matter has progressed beyond the stage of an "exploratory investigation."&nbsp; As I wrote in <i>Evans</i>, at p. 893, "I should not be taken as suggesting that the police, in the course of an exploratory investigation, must reiterate the right to counsel every time that the investigation touches on a different offence".</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
