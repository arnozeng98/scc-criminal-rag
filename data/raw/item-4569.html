   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The Ontario Court of Appeal set aside appellant’s conviction of fraud and substituted a conviction of attempted fraud since the subject of the alleged fraud was not in fact deceived. The complainant was assisting the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations in monitoring the practices of car repairs business and knew that the transmission of the car brought to the appellant’s garage had been tampered with. The Court found that the evidence adduced was only consistent with the appellant renewing his original representation after he became aware that that was untrue.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held: </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">There is no discernible distinction between intent as it goes to the substantive offence and as it goes to a mere attempt. In either case the <i>actus </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">reus</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">is essential to the particular charge. Section 24 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>merely required proof of intent and of accused going beyond mere preparation. Here, the external facts found in the evidence carried the acts beyond mere intention and amounted to a continuance of the accused’s objective manifestation. This established the elements of the attempt.</span></p> 
   <p class="History"><span lang="EN-CA">APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal setting aside appellant’s conviction of fraud and substituting a conviction of attempted fraud. Appeal dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 584]</span></p> 
   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">Alan D. Gold, for the appellant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">David H. Doherty, for the respondent.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of the Court was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This case arose out of a charge of fraud laid against the appellant under <i>Criminal Code, </i>s. 338(1)(<i>b</i>). His conviction at trial was set aside by the Ontario Court of Appeal which substituted a conviction of attempted fraud, it being conceded that the subject of the alleged fraud, one Sheila Harris, an employee of the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations, was not in fact deceived. She had been assisting the Ministry in monitoring the practices of persons operating garage repair businesses. She had brought a well used car to the appellant’s repair shop, knowing that the transmission had been slightly tampered with and could be rectified with a few minutes work. She told the appellant that she had transmission trouble, and after he took the car for a test drive he told her that the transmission would have to be rebuilt and that the repair would cost $189 plus $3.50 sales tax.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">When Sheila Harris reclaimed the car she paid the previously mentioned charge for the work. Without going into detail, it is enough to say that the bill she received noted that the transmission had been rebuilt but this was not in fact so. The Ontario Court of Appeal, speaking through MacKinnon A.C.J.O. held that there was an attempt to commit the offence specified in the indictment. In his view, “the evidence is consistent only with the appellant renewing or continuing his original representation that the transmission required overhauling after he became aware that that was untrue”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In this Court, counsel for the appellant advanced three propositions, of which the third was that there must be a concurrence between the <i>actus </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">reus</span></i><span lang="EN-CA"> (the representation) and the <i>mens rea </i>that there was no <i>mens rea</i> at the time the statement or representation to the Crown witness was</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 585]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">made, and that if <i>mens rea, </i>did arise later, the <i>actus </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">reus</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">had been long completed. I need say as to this submission only that it is covered by the finding above-quoted by MacKinnon A.C.J.O. Concurrence was therefore present.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The other two propositions advanced by Mr. Gold for the appellant were not as such reflected in the Court of Appeal’s reasons. Counsel dwelt on two points. First, he said that <i>Criminal Code,</i> s. 24(1) dealing with attempts contains an inherent contradiction when it requires proof of an intent to commit the substantive offence. Moreover, it involves, on his submission, proof of all the ingredients essential to the full offence, and if no crime has been committed (when the complainant has not been deceived) the accused cannot be charged with the required intent. Moreover, in the counsel’s view, an attempt envisages failure not success, and if the planned deception has been achieved there can be no liability for attempt.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Second, it was his submission that proximity was an essential requirement in the sense, to put it generally, that the actions of the accused must go beyond mere preparation and close (a question of degree) to the realization of his purpose. Putting these matters another way, if the acts of the accused go beyond mere preparation, they could amount to an attempt; however, if they are thereafter carried out and result in success and if, as in this case they do not amount to a crime, there could be a conviction of attempt. Counsel for the accused contends that the provisions of <i>Criminal Code, </i>s. 24(1) which define attempts do not affect the cogency of his propositions.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal Code, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">s. 24(1) and (2) read as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">24.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under the circumstances to commit the offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) The question whether an act or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the offence, and too</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 586]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">remote to constitute an attempt to commit the offence, is a question of law.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There are answers to these propositions under this statutory provision. In the first place, there is no discernible distinction between intent as it goes to the substantive offence and as it goes to a mere attempt. In either case, the <i>actus </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">reus</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">is essential to the particular charge. In this case the question whether the accused’s intent remained only subjective is answered by what was said by the Ontario Court of Appeal. The external facts found in the evidence carried the acts beyond mere intention and amounted to a reaffirmation or a continuance of the accused’s objective manifestation. This established the elements of the attempt.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This leaves for consideration the so-called proximity principle. It may well be that this is envisaged by the reference to remoteness in s. 24(2), but I do not see that it advances the essential issue in attempt which requires going beyond mere preparation. Nor do I find cogency in the appellant’s submission that if there is impossibility this does not bring any act of the accused closer to realization so as to establish proximity. I read s. 24(1) as making a different distinction, one merely requiring proof of intent and of accused going beyond mere preparation by making, as in this case, a false representation even though not resulting in full realization of his objective.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
