 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </span>appellant’s<span style="line-height:200%"> trial for sexually assaulting J.M. was conducted by a judge alone. &nbsp;On a <i>voir dire</i> to determine the admissibility of the similar fact evidence regarding J.S., the trial judge permitted the Crown to prove the 1995 conviction for the limited purpose of linking the appellant to the earlier sexual assault.&nbsp; The trial judge did not permit the appellant to challenge the prior conviction on the <i>voir dire</i>, although she allowed him to do so on the trial proper. &nbsp;Placing considerable weight on the prior conviction involving J.S., the trial judge ultimately convicted the appellant of sexually assaulting J.M. &nbsp;His appeal from conviction was dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: &nbsp;The appeal should be dismissed.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prior conviction was admissible as “some evidence” linking the appellant to the assault on J.S. <b><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;</span></b><span style="line-height:200%">In the context of a similar fact application, a prior conviction may be tendered to establish an essential element of the prior offence where that element has been placed in issue. &nbsp;In this case, the appellant contested that he was the person responsible for the prior act, thus putting the question of identity in issue and allowing the Crown to lead the prior conviction as “some evidence” of his involvement in that prior act.&nbsp; The admissibility of a prior conviction does not depend on whether it was the product of a guilty plea or a post‑trial guilty verdict.&nbsp; Verdicts should not be viewed as hearsay or opinion evidence of questionable value. &nbsp;Whether rendered by a jury or by judge alone, they are presumptively reliable and, on the issue of identity, should be treated that way unless overturned on appeal or later shown to be wrong.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because similar fact evidence is presumptively inadmissible, its probative value must exceed its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; In this case, the prejudicial effect of admitting the prior conviction did not warrant its exclusion. &nbsp;The appellant’s prior conviction for sexually assaulting J.S. had significant probative value.&nbsp; Admitting it did not, <i>per se</i>, render the trial unfair or occasion irretrievable prejudice to the appellant.&nbsp; There are several reasons for this.&nbsp; First, it is not uncommon for a trier of fact to be exposed to a prior conviction, in the form of a guilty plea, which stems from the similar fact evidence the Crown seeks to lead.&nbsp; The trier of fact is made aware of the limited use that can be made of the similar fact evidence, and the accused can challenge or explain the prior conviction.&nbsp; Second, while a prior conviction constitutes strong proof that the similar act conduct in question occurred, that does not make the conviction inadmissible.&nbsp; The fact that a piece of evidence operates unfortunately for an accused does not render the evidence inadmissible or the trial unfair.&nbsp; Third, an accused is entitled to a fair trial, not a trial in which the playing field is tilted in his or her favour.&nbsp; Once an accused challenges his or her involvement in an earlier incident, the rules of evidence do not permit the accused to keep the best evidence linking him or her to that incident — the conviction — from the trier of fact.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While an accused should not be automatically foreclosed from challenging a prior conviction at the <i>voir dire </i>stage of a similar fact application, situations in which such a challenge may be launched will be rare because of the low evidentiary threshold (“some evidence”) required to link an accused to the similar act.&nbsp; A challenge at the <i>voir dire</i> stage will not be appropriate if there is no reasonable likelihood that it will impact the admissibility of the evidence. &nbsp;In deciding whether the conviction can be challenged, labels such as <i>res judicata </i>and abuse of process are unhelpful and inappropriate — neither of these doctrines can prevent an accused from challenging a prior conviction on a <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; The decision to allow a challenge or not at the <i>voir dire</i> stage is a function of the trial judge’s right to control the proceedings.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge made no error in receiving the prior conviction on the similar fact <i>voir dire</i> for the limited purpose of linking the appellant to the sexual assault on J.S.&nbsp; The verdict giving rise to the prior conviction constituted highly reliable evidence and, at a minimum, constituted “some evidence” that he had assaulted J.S.&nbsp; Its probative value was clear and outweighed any prejudicial effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the trial proper, the trial judge was satisfied, on balance, that the appellant had assaulted J.S.&nbsp; The frailties of the identification evidence, though well known to her, did not cause her to doubt the integrity of the prior conviction.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">This appeal raises evidentiary and procedural issues surrounding the admissibility and use of a prior conviction, where the conduct underlying that conviction is sought to be introduced as similar fact evidence to prove identity.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In this case, the similar act conduct relates to the sexual assault of a woman named J.S. in 1993, for which the appellant was convicted in 1995.&nbsp; On a <i>voir dire</i> to determine the admissibility of that evidence, Arnold-Bailey J. permitted the Crown to prove the 1995 conviction for the limited purpose of linking the appellant to the sexual assault on J.S.&nbsp; The trial judge did not permit the appellant to challenge the prior conviction on the <i>voir dire</i>, although she allowed him to do so on the trial proper.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead his 1995 conviction on the similar fact application.&nbsp; He further submits that the trial judge erred in foreclosing him from challenging that conviction on the <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; Those two issues form the centrepiece of this appeal.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Several years after his release from prison on the J.S. matter, the appellant was charged again with sexual assault, this time in relation to a woman named J.M.&nbsp; The incident in question occurred on February 19, 2005.&nbsp; At the trial relating to this incident — which forms the basis of the instant appeal — the appellant denied that he was responsible for the assault on J.M.&nbsp; The circumstantial evidence pointed to the appellant and one other man as the only two people who could have committed the crime.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The sexual assault on J.M. took place at a house where she and her friends, along with the appellant and others, had been partying.&nbsp; At the end of the evening, the appellant left to walk home.&nbsp; About five minutes later, C.S., who lived at the house, and her partner, G.B., went looking for the appellant to offer him a ride home.&nbsp; At that point, J.M. and one man were alone in the house.&nbsp; Both had passed out from excessive alcohol consumption.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Unable to find the appellant, C.S. and G.B. returned to the house.&nbsp; They had been gone for no more than 15 minutes.&nbsp; C.S. was surprised to find the front door locked.&nbsp; She banged on the door and, a minute or so later, the appellant opened it from the inside, rushed past her and G.B., and ran away.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">C.S. and G.B. entered the home where they found J.M. unconscious, naked from the waist down, lying on the living room floor.&nbsp; Blunt instruments — consisting of an electric toothbrush, a hair brush with a five- or six-inch handle and a regular toothbrush — were found on the floor near her.&nbsp; According to the unchallenged evidence of C.S. and G.B., those items were out of place and must have been removed by someone from the bathroom where they were normally kept.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The next morning, while urinating, J.M. excreted a wine cork from her vagina.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On the <i>voir dire </i>to determine the admissibility of the proposed similar fact evidence, Crown counsel called a number of witnesses who had testified approximately 11 years earlier, at the appellant’s 1995 trial.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; J.S. was not among them, as she had died in the interim.&nbsp; One of the witnesses described the nature of the sexual assault on J.S., and others recounted the appellant’s post-assault movements pending the arrival of the police and his ensuing arrest. &nbsp;Crown counsel who prosecuted the J.S. case tendered a certified copy of the indictment upon which the appellant was tried and convicted.&nbsp; A doctor who examined J.S. testified about the compacted shopping bags in J.S.’s vagina.&nbsp; She explained that, in the course of 142 examinations of alleged sexual assault victims over the past 15 years, she had never before found a foreign object in a vagina.&nbsp; Evidence was also tendered which established that fingerprints taken from the appellant upon his arrest in 1993 matched the fingerprints taken from him upon his arrest in 2005.&nbsp; That is to say, the appellant definitively was the same man who had been convicted of the 1993 sexual assault of J.S.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The appellant challenged the testimony of the witnesses who purported to identify him as J.S.’s assailant.&nbsp; He impugned the reliability of their observations and called into question some of the police practices used to identify him — just as he had at his trial in 1995.&nbsp; However, he did not testify on the <i>voir dire</i> and hence did not directly deny responsibility for the assault on J.S.&nbsp; In closing submissions on the <i>voir dire</i>, he characterized the evidence implicating him as J.S.’s assailant as tenuous and claimed that it was insufficient to link him to the assault on J.S.&nbsp; Thus, he argued that the J.S. incident could not be used to connect him to the charge involving J.M. and, for that reason (among others that are no longer in issue), it should not be received as similar fact evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the enumeration of similarities set out above, I find that there is a striking similarity between the similar act evidence pertaining to the 1993 sexual assault of J.S. when compared to the alleged sexual assault of J.M.&nbsp; I find the similar act evidence to be highly probative in relation to the issue of identity of the perpetrator of the sexual assault on J.M.&nbsp; In accordance with the steps of analysis set out in <i>Arp</i> at ¶ 50, the significant similarities of the 1993 sexual assault make it highly probative evidence and outweigh its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; The high degree of similarity makes it unlikely that the accused’s involvement in the alleged act is a product of coincidence.&nbsp; <u>I find, based on the degree of striking similarity, that it is likely that the same person committed both sexual assaults.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; ruling on <i>voir dire</i>, at para. 84.]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The trial judge then turned to consider whether there was “some evidence” linking the appellant to the crime against J.S.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The trial judge refused to give effect to the defence position.&nbsp; She recognized that memories had faded and that some witnesses from the 1995 trial were unavailable, including the victim J.S. who had passed away in the interim.&nbsp; She also noted that there appeared to be some inconsistencies in the description of J.S.’s attacker by the eyewitnesses now called on this <i>voir dire</i> and the police may have engaged in some dubious practices regarding the issue of identification in 1993.&nbsp; However, those matters and the appellant’s denial that he had sexually assaulted J.S. would have been brought to the attention of the jury who convicted him nonetheless.</span></p>

F. Hewthorn &amp; Co.</i>, [1943] 1 K.B. 587, where the English Court of Appeal held that, on a subsequent trial, a conviction in a previous criminal trial was not admissible as it constituted irrelevant opinion evidence (see p. 595).&nbsp; The appellant relies on this case for the proposition that his prior conviction was inadmissible.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[50]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I find the appellant’s submission unpersuasive for several reasons.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">First, it is not uncommon for triers of fact to be exposed to prior convictions that stem from the similar fact evidence the Crown seeks to lead.&nbsp; Normally, these convictions are the product of guilty pleas as opposed to post-trial guilty verdicts (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Snow </i>(2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 40 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Fisher</i>, 2003 SKCA 90, 179 C.C.C. (3d) 138, leave to appeal refused [2004] 3 S.C.R. viii; and <i>R. v. James </i>(2006), 84 O.R. (3d) 227 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused [2007] 3 S.C.R. x).&nbsp; But for purposes of assessing prejudice, I see no meaningful distinction between the two.&nbsp; In both instances, the trier of fact is made aware of the prior conviction and the limited use that can be made of it; and in both instances, the accused can challenge or explain the prior conviction if he or she so chooses.&nbsp; The authorities cited above undercut the appellant’s <i>per se</i> submission that judges and juries will inevitably engage in impermissible propensity reasoning when confronted with a prior conviction stemming from the similar fact evidence the Crown proposes to lead.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Second, a prior conviction constitutes strong proof that the similar act conduct in question occurred.&nbsp; In that sense, it has greater probative value than an unproven allegation (see, e.g., D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i> (rev. 5th ed. 2008), at pp. 144-47).&nbsp; While a conviction may be harder to respond to than an unproven allegation, that does not make the conviction inadmissible.&nbsp; Just because a piece of evidence operates unfortunately for an accused does not of itself render the evidence inadmissible or the trial unfair (see <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 724-25, <i>per </i>La Forest J., dissenting on other grounds).</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Returning to the matter of fairness, I find the appellant’s overall position to be untenable.&nbsp; On his scenario, in order to establish the identity link required by the second <i>Arp</i> test,<i> </i>the Crown would be required to call the witnesses from the 1995 trial to re-prove its case.&nbsp; The appellant could cross-examine them with a view to impugning their testimony and the integrity of the police investigation — all the while suppressing the fact<b> </b>that he had been convicted of sexually assaulting J.S. following a trial by judge and jury.&nbsp; In oral argument before this Court, he went even further and submitted that if he were to testify and deny having sexually assaulted J.S., it would be impermissible for the Crown to cross-examine him on his prior conviction for credibility purposes.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In the end, as with all similar fact evidence, it falls to trial judges, in the exercise of their discretion, to admit the evidence if its probative value exceeds its prejudicial effect and to exclude it if it does not.&nbsp; In concluding, as I have, that the trial judge in the instant case did not err in admitting the appellant’s 1995 conviction for the limited purpose of linking him to the assault on J.S., I should not be taken as holding that prior convictions will always be admissible when similar fact evidence is tendered.&nbsp; Each case must be assessed on its own facts and circumstances.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">To the extent that an accused wishes to challenge a prior conviction at the <i>voir dire </i>stage, I see no reason why he or she should be automatically foreclosed from doing so.&nbsp; If, for example, an accused could show that the conviction in question had been overturned on appeal or set aside pursuant to an Application for Ministerial Review under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec696.3subsec3" target="_blank">s. 696.3(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">That said, in the end, the trial judge was satisfied that she could safely rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses who testified on the similar fact <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; In her reasons for judgment at para. 193, quoted above at para. 25, she stated that, based on her assessment of the credibility and reliability of all of the witnesses who testified at the trial, she “accept[ed] the evidence of the witnesses called by the Crown, both in relation to the 1993 incident, and the present charge [involving J.M.]”.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Various witnesses called by the Crown on the <i>voir dire</i> identified the appellant as J.S.’s assailant.&nbsp; At para. 193, the trial judge plainly stated that she accepted their evidence.&nbsp; In so concluding, she would not have lost sight of the frailties in their evidence which she had earlier identified in her similar fact ruling.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">From this, it is implicit there was nothing said by the identification witnesses that caused the trial judge to question the integrity of the appellant’s 1995 conviction.&nbsp; On the contrary, their evidence, which she accepted, supported it.&nbsp; Put simply, had the trial judge made specific reference to the witnesses who testified on the <i>voir dire</i> and who identified the appellant as J.S.’s assailant, the verdict, in my view, would inevitably have been the same.</span></p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Conclusion</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge did not err in receiving the appellant’s 1995 conviction for the limited purpose of linking him to the sexual assault on J.S.&nbsp; The appellant did not provide a proper basis for seeking to challenge that conviction on the <i>voir dire</i>, since there was no reasonable likelihood that re-litigating the 1995 trial would have impacted on the admissibility of the evidence in question.&nbsp; Hence, the trial judge’s refusal to consider the matter occasioned no harm to him.&nbsp; On the trial proper, it is apparent that the trial judge considered the whole of the evidence in determining that she was satisfied, on balance, that the appellant was the person who assaulted J.S.&nbsp; The frailties in the evidence identifying the appellant as her attacker, though well known to the trial judge, did not cause the trial judge to doubt the integrity of the 1995 conviction.</span></p>
