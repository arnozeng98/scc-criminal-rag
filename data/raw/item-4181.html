Both are negligence‑based offences for which fault requires proof of a failure to direct the mind to a risk of harm which the reasonable parent would have appreciated. However, the fault element of each offence is in large part premised on the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence and the <i>actus reus</i> of each offence differ.&nbsp; The <i>actus reus </i>of failing to provide the necessaries of life required proof that the accused was under a legal duty to provide the necessaries of life to M, that he failed, viewed objectively, to perform the duty, and that this failure, assessed objectively, endangered M’s life or caused or was likely to cause M’s health to be endangered permanently.&nbsp; The <i>actus reus </i>of criminal negligence required proof that the accused was under a legal duty to do something, that he failed, viewed objectively, to perform his duty, and that in failing to perform his duty, he showed, assessed objectively, a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.&nbsp; While the two offences may involve the same legal duty, each offence sets out a different type of risk of harm and the trial judge’s instructions to the jury were clear on that point.&nbsp; The jury was instructed on both counts to find a marked and substantial departure from what a reasonable parent would do in the circumstances.&nbsp; For the offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life, the jury was further instructed to consider whether the accused endangered M’s life or caused or likely caused his health to be endangered permanently.&nbsp; This harm was described as unique to the offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life.&nbsp; The charge to the jury set out the essential elements of each offence in such a way that the jury did not answer the same question when determining each verdict.

Johnson</i>, 2007 CarswellOnt 7765 (Ct. J.)).&nbsp; And in the few reported cases where the accused was finally acquitted of one of these offences and convicted of the other, the conviction was for failure to provide the necessaries of life and the acquittal for criminal negligence (see, for example, <i>R. v.

On the basis of this impugned instruction by the trial judge, the Crown now argues that the jury could reasonably, though wrongly as a matter of law, find the respondent not guilty of failing to provide the necessaries of life in omitting to protect his child from the violence of his spouse — but nonetheless guilty of criminal negligence <i>because of the very same omission</i>.&nbsp;</p>

Finally, verdicts are deemed inconsistent — and therefore unreasonable as a matter of law — if no <i>properly instructed </i>jury could reasonably have returned them both: <i>R. v.

20.85pt">The task of a trial judge charging a jury in these circumstances would be difficult and, in my view, it would be necessary to keep clearly separate the two offences or the elements of the two offences which must be dealt with.&nbsp; This could be achieved by approaching the charge in two steps.&nbsp; The first step, I suggest, would be to deal with the underlying offence in s. 197(2) [now s. 215] of the <i>Code</i>, for under this indictment until this question is settled no approach can be made to the crime of manslaughter actually charged.&nbsp; The jury should be instructed on the elements of the offence under s. 197 and told that for a conviction under that section they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellants were under a duty to provide necessaries of life to their son, and that they failed to do so without lawful excuse.&nbsp; If they were not so satisfied, they would acquit the accused and go no further, for the sole basis of the manslaughter allegation would be gone.&nbsp; If, however, they were to find that the accused had failed to provide the necessaries without lawful excuse, then it would be necessary for them to go further and consider whether in such failure they had shown a wanton and reckless disregard for the life and safety of their son. <u>If the jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that such conduct had been shown and that it had caused the death of the child, they would be obligated to convict of manslaughter, and on this indictment that is the only way a conviction of manslaughter could be reached. If, on the other hand, the jury were not so satisfied, they would be required to acquit the accused of the crime of manslaughter.&nbsp; If, however, they were satisfied that the necessaries of life had been withheld but in doubt as to whether the deprivation was the cause of the son’s death, they could in that case convict of the included offence under s. 197</u> . . . .

The jury would then consider whether the accused had a duty to protect the child — that is, to provide the necessaries of life — and whether the accused failed in that duty.&nbsp; If so, the jury would be entitled to find that the accused committed an offence under s. 215(2)(<i>a</i>)(ii).&nbsp; The jury would then be required to decide whether the accused, in failing to provide the necessaries of life, showed a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of the child.&nbsp; If so, the jury would be bound to find the accused guilty of criminal negligence.&nbsp; If not, the jury could still find the accused guilty of failure to provide the necessaries of life, but not of criminal negligence.</p>

The Crown appeals to this Court on the basis that the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law by concluding that the verdicts were inconsistent. J.F. cross-appeals and argues that an acquittal ought to have been entered instead of a new trial being ordered.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A court of appeal’s power to set aside a verdict of guilt on the ground that it is inconsistent is found under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec686subsec1" target="_blank">s. 686(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>)(i) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> which provides that the court “may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that . . . the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”. This Court has the power to make the same order under s. 695(1). Hence, <u>before an appellate court may interfere with a verdict on the ground that it is inconsistent, the court must find that the verdict is unreasonable</u>. The appellant bears the onus to show that no reasonable jury whose members had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at that conclusion: <i>R. v. McLaughlin</i> (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 562 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">The onus of establishing that a verdict is unreasonable on the basis of inconsistency with other verdicts is a difficult one to meet because the jury, as the sole judge of the facts, has a very wide latitude in its assessment of the evidence. The jury is entitled to accept or reject some, all or none of any witness’s testimony. Indeed, individual members of the jury need not take the same view of the evidence so long as the ultimate verdict is unanimous. Similarly, the jury is not bound by the theories advanced by either the Crown or the defence. The question is whether the verdicts are supportable on any theory of the evidence consistent with the legal instructions given by the trial judge. Martin J.A. aptly described the nature of the inquiry in <i>R. v. McShannock </i>(1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 53 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 56, as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify">Where on any realistic view of the evidence, the verdicts cannot be reconciled on any rational or logical basis the illogicality of <u>the verdict tends to indicate that the jury must have been confused as to the evidence or must have reached some sort of unjustifiable compromise</u>.&nbsp; We would, on the ground that the verdict is unreasonable alone, allow the appeal, set aside the verdict, and direct an acquittal to be entered.</p>

Creighton</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at p. 58). However, the fault element is in large part premised on the <i>actus reus</i>. Indeed, the inquiry into the <i>actus reus </i>entails an objective assessment of the specific risk of harm at issue. The judge will determine what the specific risk is by looking at the words of the statute. For example, for the purposes of various <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> offences, the risk of harm can be defined as “in a manner that is dangerous to the public” (s. 249(1)(<i>a</i>)), “in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons” (s. 86(1)), “shows . .&nbsp;. disregard for the lives or safety of other persons” (s. 219(1)), or “endangers the life of the person to whom the duty is owed, or causes or is likely to cause the health of that person to be endangered permanently” (s. 215(2)(<i>a</i>)(ii)).&nbsp; The risk of harm is therefore generally set out in the statutory description of the <i>actus reus</i>.</p>

Following Charron J.’s reasoning in <i>R. v. Beatty</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, 2008&nbsp; SCC 5, the marked departure standard is not applied at this point, since “[n]othing is gained by adding to the words of [the statute] at this stage of the analysis” (para. 45).</p>

Gosset</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 76, at p. 93). As Charron J. stated: “The degree of negligence is the determinative question because criminal fault must be based on conduct that merits punishment” (<i>Beatty</i>, at para. 35). Thus, “penal negligence punishes a <i>marked</i> departure from an objectively reasonable standard of care” (<i>R. v. Naglik</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, at p. 142 (emphasis in original)).</p>

Wanton or reckless behaviour has been equated with a marked <i>and substantial</i> departure from the norm (H.

He further instructed the jury that it needed to be satisfied that the failure to provide the necessaries of life constituted a marked and substantial departure from reasonable behaviour. However, these instructions cannot cast doubt on the conviction for criminal negligence, because the elements in question clearly apply on that count. Nor can they explain the acquittal, because the same instructions were given for both counts and the evidence was found sufficient for the count of criminal negligence. The explanation for the acquittal must thus lie in the differences between the two underlying offences.&nbsp; In my view, two observations make it clear why the conviction is not unreasonable and the two verdicts are not inconsistent.&nbsp; The first is that the judge properly charged the jury on the count of criminal negligence, and the second is that the express instructions on Step 3 (threshold level of harm for the count of failing to provide the necessaries of life) were correct.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">It is of some significance in that situation to check the physical status of the child. When seen on May 2, 2000, DeCoen noted nothing remarkable about the child’s condition physically. She did not notice any bruising or scrapes on the child. His abdomen was soft. She saw no cuts or lacerations. He didn’t show any soreness or tenderness. She had no concerns for his physical well-being as at that time. [A.R., at pp. 551-52]</p>

She says that she was “shocked by the number of bruises and their various stages of healing”. She admits that she is not an expert in the aging of bruises, but expressed the opinion that she could tell from the colouring that the bruises were of different ages. She described more recent bruising as being purplish and blue in colour, perhaps with some redness around the edges. She says older bruises are brownish or grey. She described some of the bruising on the child as being older and some fresh, but that the majority of the bruising seemed older. DeCoen did not map or chart the bruises, their location, or their respective descriptions on the body. She conceded on cross-examination that her primary focus was life-saving and not on the bruises. From her experience, most of the bruises appeared to be over 24 hours old. She also believed that some of the bruises appeared to be a couple of days old. [A.R., at p. 553]</p>

L.K. indicated that sometime in the month before K.M.’s death she had seen a large bruise on his eye that extended across his face from one cheek to the other. Jean F. said she had seen some bruising.

In contrast, “health” refers more often to the general condition of the body reflected in the expressions that one is in “good health” or “poor health”. Moreover, to have one’s health “permanently endangered” imports an element of a condition that is indefinite in duration.

The Queen</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, stands for the proposition, as refined in <i>R. v. Prince</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, that convictions are not to be entered on more than one count if the offences share a close factual connection and a close legal nexus, even if the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of both offences. The rule in <i>Kienapple</i> should not be used in such a way that no conviction is entered at all.</p>

line-height:200%">[94]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Moreover, the <i>Kienapple</i> rule is narrow. It has been held not to apply to the following pairs of offences: attempted armed robbery and use of a firearm while attempting to commit an indictable offence (<i>Krug v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 255), impaired driving causing bodily harm and criminal negligence causing bodily harm (<i>R. v. Andrew </i>(1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 301 (B.C.C.A.)), and use of a firearm while attempting to commit an indictable offence and aggravated assault (<i>R. v. Switzer</i> (1987), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 303 (Alta. C.A.)). In his reasons, Fish J. implicitly extends the rule against multiple convictions to a case where there was only one conviction and clearly extends the rule against inconsistent verdicts in directing a reviewing court to weigh the relative degree of blameworthiness when a jury enters different verdicts.</p>

line-height:200%">[95]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Even if I were to agree that the verdict is unreasonable, I would&nbsp; disagree on the remedy. My colleague relies on the fact that the Crown did not appeal the acquittal on the charge of failure to provide the necessaries of life (para. 23). However, such an appeal is not necessary in this case. In <i>R. v. Provo</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, the accused was charged with incest and sexual assault. The trial judge found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both counts, but acquitted him of sexual assault on the basis of <i>Kienapple</i>. The accused appealed his conviction and the Crown did not appeal the acquittal. The Manitoba Court of Appeal found that the accused was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of sexual assault, but not of incest. It convicted him of sexual assault even though the Crown had not appealed the acquittal, and acquitted him of incest. This Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision on the basis of s. 613(8) (now s. 686(8)) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which empowers an appeal court to make any order that justice requires. Where, as in <i>Provo</i>, the Crown does not appeal an acquittal, a court of appeal which finds defects in the conviction and in the jury charge which led to the acquittal should not be deprived of this power to “make any order, in addition, that justice requires” (s. 686(8) of the <i>Code</i>). In the instant case, had I found the verdict unreasonable, the just order would have been a new trial on both counts.</p>

line-height:200%">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>I also disagree with Fish J.’s assertion that the differences between the underlying offences were “of little relevance on the facts of this case” (para. 5). All the evidence presented at trial on the time line of the bruising, which was summarized at length by the trial judge in his charge to the jury, suggests that the differences were very relevant.</p>

line-height:200%">[97]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>I also take issue with my colleague’s comment that the distinction between the two offences was not “specifically explained by the judge in his charge to the jury” (para. 5) and “was at no time raised by either side throughout the entire course of the trial” (para. 27 (emphasis deleted)).&nbsp; On the contrary, the judge specifically laid out in detail the essential elements of each offence. Regarding the offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life, he expressly explained that “Crown counsel has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the failure of [J.F.] to provide the necessaries of life required of him in the circumstances either endangered the life of [K.M.] or caused or was likely to cause his health to be permanently endangered.” In my view, this instruction could do nothing but draw the jury’s attention to the difference between the two offences, and there is no reason to believe that the jury did not understand.&nbsp; My colleague’s approach can be explained only by a failure to acknowledge that while the judge made no distinction between the offences as regards the standard of conduct (marked and substantial departure) and the risk (to health or safety), he correctly drew the jurors’ attention to an additional element required to prove the failure to provide the necessaries of life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%">[98]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The question is whether the guilty verdict is unreasonable. In this case, as already discussed, the instructions on the standard of conduct and the risk to health or safety might have set the bar too high on the count based on the underlying offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life. If any doubt were raised by the instructions, any error would have benefited J.F. and would not warrant entering an acquittal on the other charge (<i>R. v. Couture</i> (1988), 27 Q.A.C. 205). In any event, the instructions cannot cast doubt on the conviction on the criminal negligence count, because they were the correct instructions for that count.</p>

line-height:200%">[99]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Finally, since the jury was told that the offence of failure to provide the necessaries of life entailed an element in addition to the ones required for the offence of criminal negligence, to find that the verdicts are inconsistent and enter an acquittal on the latter count would be to dismiss the jury’s work on both counts, but in particular on that of criminal negligence, for which neither the instructions nor the verdict can be criticized. It has not been demonstrated that the jurors were in any way confused or had any reason to be confused, or that they “must have reached some sort of unjustifiable compromise”. In other words, the verdict has not been shown to be unreasonable.</p>

This is not a case where a person has been convicted twice for the same offence, where one offence is a lesser and included offence or where the verdicts are inconsistent. My colleague Fish J., writing for the majority, has not explained why it is necessary to broaden or to adopt an impressionistic approach to the notion of inconsistent verdicts.&nbsp; At a time when trial judges are struggling to make their jury instructions appeal-proof, he has not pointed to any rule of law that would justify overturning the guilty verdict of a properly instructed jury.</p>
