 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complainant and the accused were in a common law relationship that spanned from 2004 to 2012. The relationship was plagued by violence and financial difficulties. According to the complainant, the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money, and she was unwilling to do this but agreed to avoid the accused’s violence. She claimed that the accused persuaded her to dance for men and to offer sexual services for money, and that she participated because of the accused’s violence. She also claimed that the accused was involved in <a name="_Hlk175731254">posting ads offering sexual services and controlled </a>all proceeds, and that this continued until she left the accused in 2012.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused was charged with trafficking the complainant and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to ss.&nbsp;279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. At trial, in addition to the complainant, five other witnesses testified: the complainant’s brother, mother and daughter, and two of her friends. These other witnesses did not provide evidence of sexual services, but did provide evidence of the accused’s violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused. While he accepted that the complainant found herself in a violent relationship with the accused, he found her testimony lacking in credibility, and had a reasonable doubt about the accused’s ties to any prostitution enterprise. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals. It held that the trial judge assessed some of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle <a name="_Hlk176336399">by ruling that the accused’s violence was past discreditable conduct but</a> that the error <a name="_Hlk175756592">had no material bearing on the acquittals</a>. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not fail to consider all the evidence. The dissenting judge would have ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and that treating the accused’s violence as past discreditable conduct misapprehended its nature and relevance to the <i>actus reus </i>and <i>mens rea</i> of both offences.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="CitationCar"><span style="color:windowtext">Held</span></span><span class="CitationCar"><span style="color:windowtext;font-style:normal"> (Côté and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the acquittals set aside, and a new trial ordered.</span></span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per </i>Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, <b>O’Bonsawin</b> and Moreau JJ.: The trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was evidence of past discreditable conduct. This error of law hindered his assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary foundation relevant to the essential elements<i> </i>of the trafficking in persons offence <a name="_Hlk177404599">and the definition of exploitation set out in s.&nbsp;279.04 of the <i>Criminal Code</i><i>.</i></a> The trial judge’s error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of the offence of trafficking in persons in s.&nbsp;279.01(1) is to comprehensively respond to all forms of trafficking. This means criminalizing a wide range of conduct carried out for the purpose of exploitation. The phrase “control, direction or influence” in s.&nbsp;279.01(1) is disjunctive, and the <i>actus reus </i>can be satisfied if the movements of the victim have only been subject to one of the elements. These elements represent a spectrum of power that the accused exerts over the victim’s movements. “Control” will regulate or govern the victim such that they will be left with little choice over their movements. “Influence” alters, sways, or affects the victim’s will when they decide how to exercise their freedom. “Direction” speaks less to the degree of power the accused exerts over the victim’s movements than to the way the accused exerts that power; it means management, guidance, advice, or instruction, and sometimes an authoritative command. It is not enough that the accused has acquired the power or the ability to control, direct, or influence the victim’s movements; they must have actualized it in one way or another. The Crown may establish the <i>actus reus</i> through evidence of violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship between the two, if the effect of that violence is such that the victim’s movements have been controlled, directed, or influenced.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>mens rea </i>for trafficking in persons requires that the accused engaged in the <i>actus reus</i> for the purpose of exploiting the victim or facilitating their exploitation. Those words do not require that actual exploitation occur, but people are usually able to foresee the consequences of their acts, and if the accused is found to have knowingly exploited the victim, then it could be reasonable to infer that the accused acted with the intent to do so. The Crown must nevertheless prove that the accused subjectively intended to exploit the complainant. Exploitation, which is defined in s.&nbsp;279.04, occurs when the accused engages in any conduct, including regular violence and threats of violence, that both causes the victim to provide or offer labour or a service, and could reasonably be expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service. The latter must be assessed using an objective test, having regard to all the circumstances, including the victim’s vulnerabilities.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past discreditable conduct evidence is evidence of the accused’s misconduct beyond what is alleged in the indictment, and is generally inadmissible. However, if it is covered by the indictment, the Crown can prove the conduct no matter how badly it may reflect on the character of the accused. In the instant case, the trial judge committed an error of law when he held that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant was past discreditable conduct evidence. Even though the trial judge admitted the evidence, this mischaracterization meant he did not assess it properly. That evidence could have been relevant to the essential elements of the offence. It could have formed the basis of a finding that the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant during the time period specified in the indictment, and a contributing cause of the complainant’s engagement in sexual services. The trial judge’s incorrect assessment of this critical evidence seriously undermined his credibility assessment of the complainant, which he used as the rationale for acquittal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquittals are not set aside lightly. Even where an error of law is made, the Crown must demonstrate that the error might have had a material bearing on the acquittal. Appellate courts should only set aside an acquittal when the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the error not occurred. In the instant case, the trial judge’s error of law undermines the foundation of the acquittals, and the possibility of a different verdict having been reached is more than abstract or purely hypothetical. The acquittals should be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the issue of whether the trial judge considered all of the evidence, an appellate court must presume that a trial judge knows the law and deals competently with issues of fact, and must read the reasons as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered. In the present matter, the reasons show that the trial judge considered the complainant’s evidence in light of the exhibits and the evidence of other witnesses. No error warrants intervention on this issue.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> <b>Côté</b> and <b>Rowe</b> JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. There is agreement with the majority that the trial judge made a legal error in characterizing certain evidence as past discreditable conduct evidence, as it was relevant to the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence. There is disagreement regarding the effect of this error, which did not have a material bearing on the acquittals. The Crown’s burden is a very heavy one that reflects the restricted nature of the Crown’s ability to appeal and the double jeopardy associated with a new trial.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To obtain a conviction for trafficking in persons under s.&nbsp;279.01(1), the Crown must establish the <i>mens rea </i>of the offence: that the accused exercised control over the complainant for the purpose of exploiting her. In the instant case, the only evidence relevant to the <i>mens rea</i> came from the complainant herself. The trial judge was not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt by the complainant’s testimony. Even if the evidence of the five witnesses was assessed as part of the elements of the offence, their testimony does not link the accused’s violent behaviour to the complainant’s provision of sexual services. The testimony accepted as credible did not address whether the accused exercised control over the complainant for the purpose of exploiting her.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge also made detailed credibility findings that shaped his assessment of the evidence of the other witnesses. Credibility findings by trial judges are owed deference on appeal. Though the trial judge mischaracterized the evidence of the other witnesses as past discreditable conduct evidence, he admitted all of it, and tested the complainant’s credibility and evidence against it. The trial judge’s credibility findings were the basis on which his reasonable doubt rested, and on which the accused was acquitted. There is no proper basis in law to set aside this conclusion. The majority’s reasoning comes perilously close to a ground of appeal of unreasonable acquittal, which is unavailable to the Crown, and may encourage courts to collapse the distinction between the <i>actus reus </i>and <i>mens rea</i> of the offence.</p>

(the “accused”) and J.D. (the “complainant”) were in a common law relationship marked by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. The couple relocated from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, then to Edmonton, Alberta, and eventually returned to Halifax. While in Fort Saskatchewan, they started engaging in sexual services for compensation, initially by having sex on a webcam, which then evolved to the provision of sexual services by the complainant. </a></p>

However, the error had no material bearing on the acquittals<a name="_Hlk176336474">, </a><a name="_Hlk175756662">since the judge still held a reasonable doubt on the essential elements of the offences, namely, that the accused “exploited [the complainant] or benefited from any alleged exploitation of her” (<i>ibid.</i>; see also para.&nbsp;31)</a>. <a name="_Hlk175756685">The majority opined that evidence of violence alone did not prove exploitation, and, as such, the evidence of the other witnesses, limited to violence, could not establish exploitation.

In its view, he did not piecemeal the evidence by treating the complainant’s credibility as determinative of the entire case. According to the majority, since the other witnesses’ evidence “was reviewed, but did not establish actual or intended exploitation” (para. 48), it could only <a name="_Hlk175756939">corroborate the complainant’s description of domestic violence. </a>It was therefore adequate for the trial judge to treat the complainant’s credibility on the element of exploitation as determinative.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><a name="_Hlk175759917">[</a><a class="" name="par41"></a><a name="_Hlk175759917">41</a><a name="_Hlk175759917">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, a closer reading of the reasons of the Court of Appeal reveals that the dissenting judge disagreed with the majority on whether the mischaracterization of part of the evidence as evidence of past discreditable conduct amounted to a misapprehension of the evidence (paras. 8, 67, 90-96 and 99). While the majority ruled that this error “did not taint [the trial judge’s] legal analysis of the elements of the offence” (para. 35), the dissenting judge opined that the trial judge’s reasons demonstrated a “lack of understanding” of the concept of past discreditable conduct, which led him to “misapprehen[d] the nature and relevance of the violent acts the [accused] inflicted on the complainant” (para. 94). </a>This is a question of law that requires us to determine whether the trial judge’s mischaracterization of the evidence of the other witnesses tainted his analysis of the evidence (see <i>R. v.</i> <i>J.M.H</i><i>.</i>, 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 29, citing <i>R. v.</i> <i>Morin</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, at p.&nbsp;295, and <i>R. v.</i> <i>B.

Even when errors of law are made, appellate courts should only set aside an acquittal when “the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the errors not occurred” (<i>R. v. Sutton</i>, 2000 SCC 50, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 595, at para. 2, citing <i>Vézeau v. The Queen</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, at pp. 291-92; <i>R. v. Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14). Our Court will thus have to determine if the alleged error(s) of law might have had a material bearing on the verdicts of acquittal (<i>R. v. Hodgson</i>, 2024 SCC 25, at para. 36).</p>

G.F.</i>, 2021 SCC 20, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 79). It must presume that a trial judge “know[s] the law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and deal[s] competently with the issues of fact” (<i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 32 and 55; <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>, 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54; <i>G.F.</i>, at para. 74; <i>R. v. Gerrard</i>, 2022 SCC 13, at para. 2; <i>R. v. Kruk</i>, 2024 SCC 7, at para. 84). It is not enough to suspect the trial judge erred in law; the appellate court must be satisfied that the trial court erred having given its reasons “a fair reading” (<i>J.M.H.</i>, at paras. 20, 23 and 31). That is, having read them “as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered” (<i>R.E.M.</i>, at para. 16; see, in the context of an appeal from an acquittal, <i>R. v.

Within this framework, he wrote explicitly that “[w]here the Crown’s case is wholly dependent on the testimony of the complainant it is essential the credibility and reliability of the complainant’s evidence be tested in the context of all the rest of the evidence” (para. 53, citing <i>R. v.

The trial judge considered all the evidence. The fact that he did not discuss in greater detail the influence that specific evidence had on his reasoning is not an error of law. The trial judge was not required to “set out every finding or conclusion in the process of arriving at the verdict”, nor did he have to detail his finding on each piece of evidence before him (<i>R.E.M.</i>, at paras. 18 and 20).</p>

Bill C-49 aimed to “broaden the reach of our existing prohibition to comprehensively respond to all forms of human trafficking, whether they occur wholly within Canada or whether they involve some cross-border or international dimension” (<i>House of Commons Debates</i>, October 17, 2005, at p.&nbsp;8620 (Hon.

The broad scope of the <i>actus reus</i> is counterbalanced by the requirement that it be carried out “for the purpose of exploiting [the victim] or facilitating their exploitation”.

This means criminalizing a wide range of conduct carried out with the purpose of exploiting or facilitating the exploitation of one or many victims. Undoubtedly, regular violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship with a victim, can be the means of perpetuating such conduct.</p>

Both the Court of Appeal of Quebec in <i>Urizar</i> and the Court of Appeal for Ontario in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Gallone</i>, 2019 ONCA 663, 147 O.R. (3d) 225, relied on <i>R. v. Perreault</i> (1996), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 573 (Que. C.A.), to discern its meaning. There, the Court of Appeal of Quebec interpreted the meaning of the phrase “exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person” in the context of the procuring offence codified at s.&nbsp;286.3(1) <i>Cr. C. </i>(formerly s.&nbsp;212(1)(h) <i>Cr. C.</i>) to mean that:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">The element of control refers to invasive behaviour, to ascendancy which leaves little choice to the person controlled. This therefore includes acts of direction and influence. There is the exercise of direction over the movements of a person when rules or behaviours are imposed. The exercise of direction does not exclude the person being directed from having a certain latitude or margin for initiative. The exercise of influence includes less constricting actions. Any action exercised over a person with a view to aiding, abetting or compelling that person to engage in or carry on prostitution would be considered influence. [Emphasis deleted; pp. 575-76.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par64">64</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal for Ontario summarizes exercising control as being “like giving an order that the person has little choice but to obey, and exercising direction is like imposing a rule that the person should follow, then exercising influence is like proposing an idea and persuading the person to adopt it” (<i>Gallone</i>, at para. 47).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par65">65</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What first emerges from those interpretations is a spectrum of power that the accused exerts over the victim’s ability to move freely and their actual movements. On one end of the spectrum, the accused will exercise “control” over the victim’s movements; the former will “regulate or govern” the latter (<i>Black’s Law Dictionary </i>(12th ed. 2024), at p.&nbsp;418), such that the victim will be left with little choice over their movements. On the other end, the accused will exercise “influence” over the victim’s movements when they will, at minimum, “induce action or change the decisions or acts of [the victim]” about their movements (p.&nbsp;928). This means that the victim is free to move wherever they like, but that when they decide how to exercise their freedom, the accused “alter[s], sway[s], or affect[s] [their] will” (p.&nbsp;928).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par66">66</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to “control” and “influence”, “direction” speaks less to the degree of power the accused exerts over the victim’s movements than to the way the accused exerts that power. “Direction” means “[m]anagement, guidance, advice or instruction”, and can sometimes refer to an “authoritative command” (<i>The Dictionary of Canadian Law</i> (5th ed. 2020), at p.&nbsp;319, citing <i>R. v. Bazinet </i>(1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.), at p.&nbsp;284), and the verb “to direct” is defined as “[t]o guide”, “to govern”, and “[t]o instruct (someone) with authority” (<i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, at p. 576). While direction will often overlap with control or influence, it can be found to have occurred even where the victim’s movements have not been controlled or influenced. Since the enumeration “control, direction or influence” is disjunctive, the <i>actus reus </i>can be satisfied if the movements of the victims have only been subject to the accused’s direction.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par67">67</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section&nbsp;279.01(1) <i>Cr. C. </i>specifies that control, direction, or influence must be “exercise[d]”.<b> </b>According to the <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, the verb “exercise” (in French, “<i>exercer</i>”) implies the realization of something: “1. To make use of; to put into action &lt;exercise the right to vote&gt;. 2. To implement the terms of; to execute &lt;exercise the option to buy the commodities&gt;” (p.&nbsp;716). It is then not enough that the accused has acquired the power or the ability to control, direct, or influence the victim’s movements. They must have actualized it in one way or another, such that the victim’s movements have been controlled, directed, or influenced by the accused.</p>

Such conduct can amount to exercising control, direction, or influence over their movements during a period of time, provided that the effect of that violence is that the victim’s movements have been effectively controlled, directed, or influenced during that time.</p>

This exclusionary rule also seeks to guard against a related human tendency to “punish the accused for past misconduct by finding that accused guilty of the offence charged”, and to avoid deflecting the attention of the trier of fact “from the main purpose of their deliberations which is the transaction charged” (<i>R. v.

Rather, he held, as a matter of law, that the regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was not an element of the <i>actus reus </i>of the trafficking in persons offence, nor the definition of exploitation. This is why it “fell to” the complainant to provide that evidence.</p>

Read contextually, this sentence reflects the trial judge’s concern that the evidence of the other witnesses on the accused’s violence did not “directly address” (paras. 42 and 57), or “directly support” (para. 31) the charges.</p>

Later in oral submissions, defence counsel argued that the complainant was “the only one who can speak to several of the essential elements in terms of the control and the alleged forcing into the sex trade”, and who can tell the trial judge that the accused exploited her (p.&nbsp;431; see also pp.&nbsp;406 and&nbsp;432).</p>

Violence is also relevant and material to the definition of exploitation, as this definition is met when the accused engages in any conduct, including regular violence and threats of violence, that both causes the victim to provide (or offer to provide) labour or a service, and could be reasonably expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety (or the safety of a person known to them) would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service.</p>

It captures “[e]very person who recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals <u>or</u> harbours a person, <u>or</u> exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person, for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation”. The use of the word “or” indicates that the <i>actus reus</i> is disjunctive. This element of the offence is made out if the Crown establishes that the accused engaged in any conduct set out in the provision (<i>R. v. A. (A.)</i>, 2015&nbsp;ONCA&nbsp;558, 327 C.C.C. (3d) 377, at para. 80;<i> Gallone</i>, at para. 33; <i>Urizar</i>, at para. 72).</p>

C.</i> captures two clusters of conduct. The first includes specific actions: “. . . recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours . . . .” The second captures accused who “exercise control, direction or influence over the movements of a person”. In the present case, the Crown relies on this second cluster of conduct to demonstrate that the accused committed the <i>actus reus</i>. It submits that regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim, and their violent relationship, can amount to exercising control, direction, or influence over their movements over a period of time. I agree.</p>

This provision prohibits a person from preventing another person from moving freely through the exercise of control, influence or direction. The Crown can establish the <i>actus reus</i> through evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship between the two, that prevents the victim’s movements because they are controlled, directed, or influenced.</p>

Building on this, the Crown submits that regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant is relevant to establishing that the accused exploited the complainant.

Further, evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the victim, when paired with other evidence establishing that the victim engaged in labour or offered labor during the time they were subjected to the accused’s regular violence, can be relevant to establishing exploitation.

C.</i>, the Crown must establish that the accused engaged in the <i>actus reus</i> “for the purpose of exploiting [the person] or facilitating their exploitation”. Those words do not require that actual exploitation occurs. Exploitation is not an essential element of the offence; only the intention to exploit or facilitate exploitation is an element of the offence (see <i>A. (A</i><i>.)</i>, at para.&nbsp;85, citing <i>Urizar</i>, at para.&nbsp;69; see also <i>Chahinian v. R.</i>, 2022 QCCA 499, at para.&nbsp;82).</p>

A finding of actual exploitation could, depending on the evidence, be relevant and material to the key question of whether the accused acted for the purpose of exploiting the complainant.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par101">101</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This inference is grounded in the assumption that “people are usually able to foresee the consequences of their acts” (<i>R. v.

Roach, <i>Criminal Law </i>(8th ed. 2022), at pp. 214-15). If the accused is found to have knowingly exploited the victim, such that the accused knows that exploitation would result from their conduct, then it could, depending on the circumstances, be reasonable to infer that the accused acted with the intent to exploit the victim. Nonetheless, when looking at evidence as a whole, courts should pay careful attention to evidence that would contradict, even refute, the inference.</p>

They note that despite his error of law, the trial judge admitted the evidence of the other witnesses, including the accused’s regular violence towards the complainant and, more generally, their violent relationship. The trial judge concluded that:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">In this case, as in <i>R. v. B. (F.F.)</i>, [[1993] 1 S.C.R. 697], this type of evidence is admissible in that it establishes <u>a pattern of dominant behaviour</u> by the accused <u>which allows the criminal conduct</u> to exist in that environment; in this case <u>the exploitation of [the complainant]</u>. [Emphasis added; para. 43.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par111">111</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the above-noted paragraph, the accused submits that the trial judge’s error of law “did not affect his legal analysis respecting the <i>actus reus </i>of the offence” because the trial judge accepted that the evidence of violence “was admissible . . . and was relevant to the conduct element of the <i>actus reus</i>” (R.F., at paras. 55 (emphasis deleted) and 61; see also para.&nbsp;56). I disagree.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par112">112</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the moment the trial judge considered the regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct, his analysis of the evidence was tainted regarding both the <i>actus reus </i>and the <i>mens rea</i>. This characterization, in and of itself, indicates that the trial judge dismissed the Crown’s theory of the case as implicating impermissible propensity reasoning when it did not. The fact that he nevertheless admitted the evidence cannot cure this misapprehension.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par113">113</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found the evidence admissible “in that it establishes a pattern of dominant behaviour by the accused which allow[ed] the criminal conduct to exist in that environment; in this case the exploitation of [the complainant]” (para. 43). This past discreditable conduct evidence “create[d] a backdrop in which such exploitation could thrive” (para. 57). The trial judge thus considered regular violence by the accused towards the complainant (i.e., the “pattern of dominant behaviour”) as distinct from the criminal conduct and exploitation. Such violence merely “allowed” that conduct to “exist” and “thrive”. This interpretation finds further support in the trial judge’s use of the words “environment” (para. 43), “backdrop” (para. 57), and “context” (paras. 44 and&nbsp;57) to describe the violence. Even though the trial judge admitted that evidence, his mischaracterization meant he could not, and did not, assess it as a possible contributing cause in the complainant’s provision of sexual services.</p>

The burden is a very heavy one and lies on the Crown (<i>R. v. Evans</i>,<i> </i>[1993] 2 S.C.R. 629, at p.&nbsp;645), who must demonstrate that “the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the errors [of law] not occurred” (<i>Sutton</i>, at para. 2, citing <i>Vézeau</i>,<i> </i>at p. 292). This standard demands more than “an abstract or purely hypothetical possibility that the accused would have been convicted but for the error of law”, but not that “the verdict would necessarily have been different” (<i>Graveline</i>, at para. 14; see also <i>George</i>, at para.&nbsp;27; <i>Hodgson</i>, at para. 36).</p>

As I have explained, the trial judge assessed the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant and, more generally, their violent relationship, based on a wrong legal principle. Having done so, the trial judge could not assess that evidence as conduct by the accused relevant to the essential elements of the offence<i> </i>and the definition of exploitation. The fact that he nevertheless admitted the evidence could not and did not cure his error.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par117">117</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I consequently agree with the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal that “the judge’s incorrect assessment of this critical evidence seriously undermined his credibility assessment of the complainant, which he used as the rationale for acquittal” (para. 99). In other words, his assessment of the other witnesses’ evidence undermined his assessment of the complainant’s evidence as it failed to appreciate the interconnectedness between both.<a name="_Hlk176343859"></a><a name="_Hlk177747133"></a></p>

Rather, had the trial judge not misapprehended the evidence, he could have reached a different conclusion with respect to the essential elements of the offence. I am satisfied with a reasonable degree of certainty that this possibility is more than abstract or purely hypothetical. While I am not persuaded that the verdict would necessarily have been different, this is not the applicable threshold (<i>Graveline</i>, at para. 14; see also<i> George</i>, at para.&nbsp;27;<i> Hodgson</i>, at<i> </i>para. 36).</p>

Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para.&nbsp;14). The Crown’s “burden in this respect is a very heavy one” that reflects “[t]he restricted nature of the Crown’s ability to appeal” and “the double jeopardy associated with a new trial” (<i>R. v.

Our colleague frames the error in the present case as follows, at para.&nbsp;109 of her reasons:</a></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I conclude that the trial judge committed an error of law when he held that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the [respondent] against the complainant provided by the other witnesses was evidence of past discreditable conduct. To the contrary, this evidence could have been relevant to the essential elements of the offence and could have formed the basis of a finding that the [respondent] controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant during the time period specified in the indictment. It could also have been found to be a contributing cause of the complainant’s provision of sexual services.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par124">124</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after articulating this error of law, our colleague adds that “[f]rom the moment the trial judge considered the [respondent’s] regular violence and threats of violence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct, his analysis of the evidence was tainted regarding both the <i>actus reus </i>and the <i>mens rea</i>” (para.&nbsp;112).</p>

Indeed, and importantly, our Court has repeatedly emphasized that credibility findings by trial judges are owed deference on appeal (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Kruk</i>, 2024 SCC 7, at para.&nbsp;82; <i>R. v. Gagnon</i>, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para.&nbsp;10). “Assessing credibility is clearly in the bailiwick of the trial judge and thus heightened deference must be accorded to the trial judge on matters of credibility” (<i>F.H. v. McDougall</i>, 2008 SCC 53, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41, at para.&nbsp;72).</p>

An appellate court cannot “translat[e] its strong opposition to the trial judge’s factual inferences .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. into supposed legal errors” (<i>R. v. George</i>, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para.&nbsp;17). To do otherwise would risk “expanding the Crown’s right of appeal beyond its proper scope” and “would have a profound impact on the interests of accused persons, especially due to the considerable anxiety created by the prospect of a new trial after a person has been acquitted” (<i>Hodgson</i>, at para.&nbsp;31).</p>

No appeal on the basis of an “unreasonable acquittal” is open to the Crown (see <i>J.M.H.</i>, at paras.&nbsp;32‑33; <i>Chung</i>, at para.&nbsp;31, per Karakatsanis&nbsp;J., dissenting). We are guided by this Court’s recent admonition that the Crown’s right of appeal of an acquittal is an “extraordinary remedy” that has been variously described as “‘drastic’, ‘exceptional’, ‘special’, ‘unusual’ and ‘limited’ in an ‘extrem[e]’ or ‘narrow’ manner” (<i>Hodgson</i>, at para.&nbsp;24).</p>

He also highlighted the fact that the complainant agreed, on cross‑examination, that she drafted and posted Craigslist ads advertising sexual services (including one featuring a number that was for her personal use) even though she had “consistently testified that [the respondent] placed all the ads” (paras.&nbsp;64‑68). The trial judge noted other inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence that called into question, <i>inter alia</i>, whether the complainant conducted negotiations with prospective clients, her “street walking”, when her sex work ended, and the amount of money she spent on drugs (paras.&nbsp;58‑68). All of the trial judge’s findings in this regard were relevant to the complainant’s credibility generally and to the alleged purpose for the respondent’s acts.</p>

Though the trial judge mischaracterized the evidence of the other witnesses as past discreditable conduct, he ultimately admitted all of it (para.&nbsp;43). The reasons demonstrate that the trial judge tested the complainant’s credibility and evidence against the evidence of the other witnesses. As our colleague acknowledges in her reasons, the trial judge devoted five paragraphs to the framework through which he would assess the complainant’s credibility and reliability (para.&nbsp;48). It is noteworthy that the trial judge wrote explicitly “</a>[w]here the Crown’s case is wholly dependent on the testimony of the complainant it is essential the credibility and reliability of the complainant’s evidence be tested <u>in the context of all the rest of the evidence</u>” (para.&nbsp;53 (emphasis added), citing <i>R. v. Stanton</i>, 2021 NSCA 57, at para.&nbsp;67). From these paragraphs, it is readily apparent that the trial judge knew to test the complainant’s evidence against the evidence of the other witnesses, regardless of how it was classified. Indeed, our colleague acknowledges that “[t]he reasons show that the trial judge considered the complainant’s evidence in light of the exhibits and the evidence of other witnesses” (para.&nbsp;48).</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am satisfied from <u>all of the evidence</u> that [the complainant] found herself trapped <u>in a violent, unhappy, and loveless relationship with [the respondent]</u>. However, the charges before this Court do not directly address the threats, intimidation, and injury <u>that I accept as proven facts</u>. The question before me is whether the Crown has proven these charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The past discreditable evidence <u>certainly creates a backdrop in which such exploitation could thrive</u>. However, I cannot just assume from that context evidence that the human trafficking allegations are proven as against [the respondent]. It requires the acceptance of [the complainant]’s evidence as credible and reliable to tie [the respondent] to the prostitution enterprise. [Emphasis added.]</p>

This demonstrates that the trial judge did, in fact, turn his mind to how the five witnesses’ evidence of “threats, intimidation, and injury” could corroborate the complainant’s evidence. As such, we strongly disagree with our colleague that the trial judge’s mischaracterization of the evidence offered by the other witnesses led him to ignore the potential impact they had on the complainant’s credibility or to entirely exclude them from this assessment. Our colleague says that “the consideration of evidence must not be confused with the assessment of evidence”, suggesting that the other witnesses’ evidence may have been <i>considered</i>, but was not <i>assessed</i> properly (para.&nbsp;50). Yet, the trial judge’s reasons do not support this assertion; just because the evidence was considered past discreditable conduct did not mean it was entirely siloed from the trial judge’s credibility analysis.</p>

However, this evidence was introduced for the first time on cross-examination, was not mentioned in N.R.’s statement or meeting with the Crown, and was not disclosed to the defence (<i>ibid.</i>).

This would fly in the face of what was said with determination and vigour so recently in <i>Hodgson</i>. Simply because there is a path for the trial judge to infer intent to exploit from a pattern of violence by an accused in some cases, does not mean that this Court can uproot the trial judge’s credibility findings so as to make out that inference in the present case.</span></a></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par155">155</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the “concrete reality of the case at hand”, the trial judge’s error in characterizing the testimony of the five witnesses did not have “a material bearing on the acquittal” (<i>Graveline</i>, at para.&nbsp;14). In our view, what is critical is that the five witnesses’ testimony was found to be admissible by the trial judge, despite his mischaracterization. And&nbsp;—&nbsp;crucially&nbsp;—&nbsp;the testimony that the trial judge accepted as credible did <i>not</i> address whether the respondent exercised control over the complainant <i>for the purpose of</i> exploiting her.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par156">156</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s credibility findings were the basis on which his reasonable doubt rested, and on which the respondent was acquitted. There is no proper basis in law to set aside the trial judge’s conclusion in this regard. The<span style="line-height:200%"> </span><i><span style="line-height:200%">Criminal Code</span></i><span style="line-height:200%"> does not provide for a ground of appeal of unreasonable acquittal; the majority’s reasoning comes perilously close to just that.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par157">157</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is another way of understanding our colleague’s analysis, which is that evidence of violence will <i>necessarily</i> give rise to an inference of intent to exploit. Indeed, our colleague acknowledges that “even where the trial judge accepts that actual exploitation occurred, the Crown must still prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the [respondent] subjectively intended to exploit the complainant” (para.&nbsp;108). However, having made that acknowledgement, it is then not given effect. As we have outlined above, there is no evidentiary basis that could allow for such an inference to be drawn in the present case. In suggesting otherwise, our colleague effectively reasons that because there is a violent relationship between the respondent and the complainant, there is therefore intent to exploit.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par158">158</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One can imagine a scenario where a person that provides sexual services is also in a violent and abusive relationship. Both of these can exist separate and independent of the other. While the abusive partner may in fact control, influence, and direct the other partner in their relationship, they may have nothing to do with the fact that this partner provides sexual services. Our colleague’s analysis suggests that the abusive partner may well be guilty of human trafficking in those circumstances, even though the link to sexual services has not been made out. To be clear, the abusive partner in these kinds of cases might be found criminally liable if they were charged with, for example, assault, uttering threats, or criminal harassment. But those offences are not charged here, and they are not equivalent to human trafficking.</p>

This is not what Parliament intended as it effectively gives rise to another presumption apart from the one established in s.&nbsp;279.01(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</a></p>
