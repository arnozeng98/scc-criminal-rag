The Immigration and Refugee Board (Appeal Division) (“IAD”) upheld the decision.&nbsp; The Federal Court –&nbsp;Trial Division dismissed the application for judicial review on the allegations of incitement to commit murder, genocide or hatred, but allowed it on the allegation of crimes against humanity.&nbsp; The Federal Court of Appeal (“FCA”) reversed several findings of fact made by the IAD, found the Minister’s allegations against M to be unfounded and set aside the deportation order.</p>

At the secondary level of appellate review, the court’s role is limited to determining, based on the correctness standard, whether the reviewing judge has chosen and applied the correct standard of review. In this case, the FCA exceeded the scope of its judicial review function when it engaged in a broad‑ranging review and reassessment of the IAD’s findings of fact, even though it had not been demonstrated that the IAD had made a reviewable error on the applicable standard of reasonableness. &nbsp;The FCA did not focus on the reasonableness of the findings, but reviewed their correctness on its own view of the evidence.&nbsp; The IAD’s findings of fact, as stated by the panel member who wrote the main reasons, were based on a careful review of all the evidence and were reasonable.&nbsp; The FCA should have proceeded with the review of the Minister’s allegations on the basis of the facts as found by the IAD, including the findings of fact in relation to the interpretation of the speech.&nbsp; On questions of law, however, the standard of review is correctness. &nbsp;The IAD is thus not entitled to deference when it comes to defining the elements of a crime or whether the Minister’s burden of proof has been discharged.

M intentionally gave the speech, and he intended that it result in the commission of murders.&nbsp; Given the context of ethnic massacres taking place at that time, M knew his speech would be understood as an incitement to commit murder.

Intent can be inferred from the circumstances.&nbsp; In this case, the allegation of incitement to the crime of genocide is well founded.&nbsp; M’s message was delivered in a public place at a public meeting and would have been clearly understood by the audience.&nbsp; M&nbsp; also had the requisite mental intent.&nbsp; He was aware that ethnic massacres were taking place when he advocated the killing of members of an identifiable group distinguished by ethnic origin with intent to destroy it in part.&nbsp;[85‑89] [94‑98]</p>

In many instances, evidence of the mental element will flow from the establishment of the elements of the criminal act of the offence.&nbsp; The trier of fact must consider the speech objectively but with regard for the circumstances in which the speech was given, the manner and tone used, and the persons to whom the message was addressed.&nbsp; The court looks at the understanding of a reasonable person in the social and historical context.&nbsp; Here, the allegation of incitement to hatred was well founded.&nbsp; The IAD’s analysis of the speech supports the inference that M intended to target Tutsi and encourage hatred of and violence against that group.&nbsp; His use of violent language and clear references to past ethnic massacres exacerbated the already vulnerable position of Tutsi in Rwanda in the early 1990s.&nbsp;[100‑107]</p>

24.4pt">With respect to the first element, both the physical and mental elements of an underlying act must be made out.&nbsp; In the case at bar, there were two possible underlying acts: counselling of murder, and persecution by hate speech.&nbsp; For counselling of murder to be considered a crime against humanity under international law, murders must actually have been committed.&nbsp; The IAD’s finding that no murders were proven to have resulted from the speech therefore precludes a finding that M counselled murder within the meaning of s.&nbsp;7(3.76), as interpreted in light of customary international law.&nbsp; The other possible underlying act, persecution, is a gross or blatant denial of fundamental rights on discriminatory grounds equal in severity to the other acts enumerated in s.&nbsp;7(3.76).&nbsp; Hate speech, particularly when it advocates egregious acts of violence, may constitute persecution, even if it does not result in the commission of acts of violence.&nbsp; The requisite mental element for persecution is that the person committing the act must have intended to commit the persecutory act and must have committed the act with discriminatory intent.&nbsp; The requirement of discriminatory intent is unique to persecution. Here, M’s speech bears the hallmarks of a gross or blatant act of discrimination equivalent in severity to the other underlying acts listed in s.&nbsp;7(3.76).&nbsp; Further, the IAD’s findings of fact amply support a finding that M committed the criminal act of persecution with the requisite discriminatory intent.

24.4pt">As for the last two elements, they require that the proscribed act take place in a particular context: a widespread or systematic attack, usually violent, directed against any civilian population.&nbsp; The widespread or systematic nature of the attack will ultimately be determined by examining the means, methods, resources and results of the attack upon a civilian population.&nbsp; There is currently no requirement in customary international law that a policy underlie the attack.&nbsp; Furthermore, the attack must be directed against a relatively large group of people, mostly civilians, who share distinctive features which identify them as targets of the attack.&nbsp; A link must be demonstrated between the act and the attack. In essence, the act must further the attack or clearly fit the pattern of the attack, but it need not comprise an essential or officially sanctioned part of it.&nbsp; A persecutory speech which encourages hatred and violence against a targeted group furthers an attack against that group.&nbsp; In this case, in view of the IAD’s findings, M’s speech was a part of a systematic attack that was occurring in Rwanda at the time and was directed against Tutsi and moderate Hutu, two groups that were ethnically and politically identifiable and were a civilian population as this term is understood in customary international law.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">Section&nbsp;7(3.76) requires, in addition to the mental element of the underlying act, that the person committing the act have knowledge of the attack and either know that his or her acts comprise part of it or take the risk that his or her acts will comprise part of it. Knowledge may be factually implied from the circumstances.&nbsp; The IAD’s findings clearly indicate that M possessed the required culpable mental state.&nbsp; M was a well‑educated man who was aware of his country’s history, of past massacres of Tutsi and of the ethnic tensions in his country, and who knew that civilians were being killed merely by reason of ethnicity or political affiliation.&nbsp; Moreover, the speech itself left no doubt that M knew of the violent and dangerous state of affairs in Rwanda in the early 1990s.&nbsp; Lastly, a man of his education, status and prominence on the local political scene would necessarily have known that a speech vilifying and encouraging acts of violence against the target group would have the effect of furthering the attack.

No. 1972 (QL)).&nbsp; The findings of fact and law were subject to judicial review in the Federal Court – Trial Division (“FCTD”) ((2001), 205 F.T.R. 29, 2001 FCT 460), and then in the Federal Court of Appeal (“FCA”).&nbsp; Décary J.A., writing for the FCA, reversed several findings of fact made by the IAD and reversed the deportation order, concluding that the Minister had not met his burden ([2004] 1 F.C.R. 3, 2003 FCA 325, with supplementary reasons (2004), 325 N.R. 134, 2004 FCA 157).&nbsp; The Minister has now appealed to this Court, and he asks that the IAD’s deportation order be confirmed.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">This speech was made in wartime (although a cease‑fire was in effect) when a multi‑party system was emerging. In this context, we may therefore expect strong language to be used. But the speech related to another context that must have been understood by both speaker and audience: the ethnic massacres. In mid‑October 1990, a short time after the outbreak of the war, 348 Tutsi were killed within 48 hours in Kibilira and 18 in Satinsyi, two communes close to Kabaya where the speech was made. In March 1992, 5 Tutsi were killed in Kibilira. Also in March of that year, again in Gisenyi prefecture and in neighbouring Ruhengeri prefecture, 300 Bagogwe (a Tutsi subgroup) were assassinated, according to official statistics. From October 1990 to February 1993, a total of 2,000 persons, mostly Tutsi, lost their lives in similar massacres in Rwanda.&nbsp; They were killed because they were considered accomplices of the “Inyenzi”. They were not soldiers or combatants, but civilians who were identified with the enemy because they belonged to a particular ethnic group. Under such circumstances, the speech cannot be considered innocuous.</p>

At all costs, you will leave here taking these words with you, that you should not let yourselves be invaded. Tell me, if you as a man, a mother or father, who are here, if someone comes one day to move into your yard and defecate there, will you really allow him to come again? It is out of the question. You should know that the first important thing . . . you have seen our brothers from Gitarama here. Their flags — I distributed them when I was working at our party’s headquarters. People flew them everywhere in Gitarama. But when you come from Kigali, and you continue on into Kibilira, there are no more M.R.N.D. flags to be seen: they have been taken down! In any case, you understand yourselves, the priests have taught us good things: our movement is also a movement for peace. However, we have to know that, for our peace, there is no way to have it but to defend ourselves. Some have quoted the following saying: [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “Those who seek peace always make ready for war.” Thus, in our prefecture of Gisenyi, this is the fourth or fifth time I am speaking about it, there are those who have acted first. It says in the Gospel that if someone strikes you on one cheek, you should turn the other cheek. I tell you that the Gospel has changed in our movement: if someone strikes you on one cheek, you hit them twice on one cheek and they collapse on the ground and will never be able to recover! So here, never again will what they call their flag, what they call their cap, even what they call their militant, come to our soil to speak: I mean throughout Gisenyi, from one end to the other!

Mr. Duquette accepted Professor Angenot’s view that the message here was not to allow oneself, as a Rwandan, to be invaded by aggressors from the RPF and from among political opponents.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Duquette noted that throughout the speech political opponents were “systematically characterized as inyenzi<span lang="EN-GB">”, or cockroaches (para. 163).</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The term “inyenzi” was used during the 1960s to refer to a group of armed refugees who were attempting to stage incursions against Rwanda from outside the country. Inyenzi literally means cockroaches, alluding to the insects that infiltrate, are everywhere at night and are not seen during the day. By extension, Mr. Mugesera — and many others, to be sure — called those who were attacking Rwanda in the 1990s, the RPF, inyenzi. The RPF, for its part referred to its members as inkotanyi (literally, tenacious fighters) in a reference to militants of the king in the 19th century. In the dictionary filed as exhibit M‑4‑9, the third meaning is given as “[Translation] member of a Tutsi incursion group, at the time of Rwanda’s independence; a partisan fighter<span lang="EN-GB">”.

(1) is something less than intentional promotion of hatred.&nbsp; On the other hand, the use of the word “wilfully” in subs. (2) suggests that the offence is made out only if the accused had as a conscious purpose the promotion of hatred against the identifiable group, or if he or she foresaw that the promotion of hatred against that group was certain to result and nevertheless communicated the statements.&nbsp; Although the causal connection need not be proven, the speaker must desire that the message stir up hatred.</p>

The “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof applies only to questions of&nbsp; fact: <i>Moreno v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i>, [1994] 1 F.C. 298 (C.A.), at p. 311.&nbsp; This means that in this appeal the standard applies to whether Mr. Mugesera gave the speech, to the message it conveyed in a factual sense and to the context in which it was delivered. On the other hand, whether these facts meet the requirements of a crime against humanity is a question of law.&nbsp; Determinations of questions of law are not subject to the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard, since the legal criteria for a crime against humanity will not be made out where there are merely reasonable grounds to believe that the speech <i>could</i> be classified as a crime against humanity. The facts as found on the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard must show that the speech <i>did</i> constitute a crime against humanity in law.</p>

Finta</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 701, found that a crime against humanity must be committed against a civilian population or an identifiable group, must be cruel and must shock the conscience of all right-thinking people (para. 335).&nbsp; He also held that the individual who commits the crime must be aware of the circumstances which render the act inhumane and must be motivated by discriminatory intent (paras. 337-38).&nbsp; To these requirements, he added, relying on <i>Sivakumar</i>, that crimes against humanity must occur on a widespread and systematic basis (para. 339).</p>

Persecution, unlike the other acts enumerated in s. 7(3.76), is not a stand-alone crime in Canadian law or in the legal systems of other countries:&nbsp; M. Cherif Bassiouni, <i>Crimes Against Humanity in International Criminal Law</i> (2nd rev. ed. 1999), at p.&nbsp;327.&nbsp; In contrast with murder, for instance, it is not evident from our domestic law what types of acts will constitute persecution.</p>

In considering the criminal act of persecution in <i>Prosecutor v. Tadic</i>, 112 ILR 1 (Trial Chamber II 1997), the ICTY, having reviewed the relevant jurisprudence and academic commentary, found that persecution “is some form of discrimination [on traditionally recognized grounds such as race, religion, or politics] that is intended to be and results in an infringement of an individual’s fundamental rights” (para. 697).&nbsp;</p>

That is the first point. The second point on which I would like us to exchange ideas is that we should not allow ourselves to be invaded, whether here where we are or inside the country. That is the second point. The third point I would like to discuss with you is also an important point, namely the way we should act so as to protect ourselves against traitors and those who would like to harm us. I would like to end on the way in which we must act.</p>

As M.D.R., P.L., F.P.R. and the famous party known as P.S.D. and even the P.D.C. are very busy nowadays, you should know what they are doing, and they are busy trying to injure the President of the Republic, namely, the President of our movement, but they will not succeed. They are working against us, the militants: you should know the reason why all this is happening: in fact, when someone is going to die, it is because he is already ill!</p>

However, the latter struck him down. After he was struck down, in all taxis everywhere in Kigali, militants of the M.D.R., P.S.D. and accomplices of the Inyenzis were profoundly humiliated, so they were almost dead! Even Twagiramungu himself completely disappeared. He did not even show up at the office where he was working! I assure you that this man’s party is covered with shame: everyone was afraid and they nearly died!</p>

The reply to him was [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “Can you lose your brothers by death!

You heard this on the radio. Then we laughed at him, you heard him yourselves, and he lost his head, he and all the militants in his party, and those of the other parties who shared his views. This is when these people had just suffered such a reverse . . . you yourselves heard that the president of our party, His Excellency Major‑General Habyarimana Juvénal, spoke when he arrived in Ruhengeri. The “Invincible” put himself solemnly forward, while the others disappeared underground! In their excitement, these people were nearly dead from excitement, as they learned that everyone, including even those who were claiming to be from other parties, were leaving them to come back to our party, as a result of our leader’s speech.</p>

At all costs, you will leave here taking these words with you, that you should not let yourselves be invaded. Tell me, if you as a man, a mother or father, who are here, if someone comes one day to move into your yard and defecate there, will you really allow him to come again? It is out of the question. You should know that the first important thing . . . you have seen our brothers from Gitarama here. Their flags — I distributed them when I was working at our party’s headquarters. People flew them everywhere in Gitarama. But when you come from Kigali, and you continue on into Kibilira, there are no more M.R.N.D. flags to be seen: they have been taken down! In any case, you understand yourselves, the priests have taught us good things: our movement is also a movement for peace. However, we have to know that, for our peace, there is no way to have it but to defend ourselves. Some have quoted the following saying: [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “Those who seek peace always make ready for war”. Thus, in our prefecture of Gisenyi, this is the fourth or fifth time I am speaking about it, there are those who have acted first. It says in the Gospel that if someone strikes you on one cheek, you should turn the other cheek. I tell you that the Gospel has changed in our movement: if someone strikes you on one cheek, you hit them twice on one cheek and they collapse on the ground and will never be able to recover! So here, never again will what they call their flag, what they call their cap, even what they call their militant, come to our soil to speak: I mean throughout Gisenyi, from one end to the other!</p>

They should know that one man is as good as another, our yard (party) will not let itself be invaded either. There is no question of allowing ourselves to be invaded, let me tell you. There is also something else I would like to talk to you about, concerning “not being invaded”, and which you must reject, as these are dreadful things. Our elder Munyandamutsa has just told you what the situation is in the following words: [<span style="text-transform:
uppercase">translation</span>] “Our inspectors, currently 59 throughout the country, have just been driven out. In our prefecture of Gisenyi there are eight. Tell me, dear parents gathered here, have you ever seen, I do not know if she is still a mother, have you ever seen this woman who heads the Ministry of Education, come herself to find out if your children have left the house to go and study or go back to school? Have you not heard that she said that from now on no one will go back to school? — and now she is attacking teachers! I wanted to draw to your attention that she called them to Kigali to tell them that she never wanted to hear anyone say again that an education inspector had joined a political party. They answered: “First leave your party, because you yourself are a Minister and you are in a political party, and then we will follow your example”. She is still there! You have also heard on the radio that nowadays she is even insulting our President! Have you ever heard a mother insulting people in public? So what I would like to tell you here, and this is the truth, there is no doubt, to say it would be this or that, there might be among them people who have behaved flippantly. Have you heard that they are persecuted for membership in the M.R.N.D.? They are persecuted for membership in the M.R.N.D. Frankly, will you allow them to invade us to take the M.R.N.D. away from us and to take our men?</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:67.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

The first is to write to this shameless woman who is issuing insults publicly and on the airwaves of our radio to all Rwandans. I want you to write her to tell her that these teachers, who are ours, are irreproachable in their conduct and standards, and that they are looking after our children with care; these teachers must continue to educate our children and she must mend her ways. That is the first action I am asking you to take. Then, you would all sign together: paper will not be wanting. If you wait a few days and get no reply, only about seven days, as you will send the letter to someone who will take it to its destination, so he will know she has received it, if seven days go by without a reply, and she takes the liberty of arranging for someone else to replace the existing inspectors, you can be sure, if she thinks there is anyone who will come to replace them (the inspectors), for anyone who comes . . . the place where the Minister is from is the place known as Nyaruhengeri, at the border with Burundi, (exactly) at Butari, you will ask this man to get moving, with his travelling provisions on his head, and be inspector at Nyaruhengeri.</p>

They have driven back the “Inyenzis” at the border, where they had arrived. Here again, I will make you laugh! In the meantime these people had arrived who were seeking power. After getting it, they headed for Brussels. On arrival in Brussels, note that this was the M.D.R., P.L. and P.S.D., they agreed to deliver the Byumba prefectorate at any cost. That was the first thing. They planned together to discourage our soldiers at any cost. You have heard what the Prime Minister said in person. He said they (the soldiers) were going down to the marshes (to farm) when the war was at its height! It was at that point that people who had low morale abandoned their positions and the “Inyenzis” occupied them. The Inyenzis descended on Byumba and they (the government soldiers) ransacked the shops of our merchants in Byumba, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. The government will have to compensate them as it had created this situation. It was not one of our merchants (who created it), as they were not even asking for credit! Why credit! So those are the people who pushed us into allowing ourselves to be invaded. The punishment for such people is nothing but: [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “Any person who demoralizes the country’s armed forces on the front will be liable to the death penalty”. That is prescribed by law. Why would such a person not be killed? Nsengiyaremye must be taken to court and sentenced. The law is there and it is in writing. He must be sentenced to death, as it states. Do not be frightened by the fact that he is Prime Minister. You have recently heard it said on the radio that even French Ministers can sometimes be taken to court! Any person who gives up any part of the national territory, even the smallest piece, in wartime will be liable to death. Twagiramungu said it on the radio and the C.D.R. dealt with him on the radio. The militants in his (party) then lost their heads — can you believe that? I would draw to your attention the fact that this man who gave up Byumba on the radio while all of us Rwandans, and all foreign countries, were listening to him, this man will suffer death. It is in writing: ask the judges, they will show you where it is, I am not lying to you! Any person who gives up even the smallest piece of Rwanda will be liable to the death penalty; so what is this individual waiting for?</p>

You know there are “Inyenzis” in the country who have taken the opportunity of sending their children to the front, to go and help the “Inkotanyis”. That is something you intend to speak about yourselves. You know that yesterday I came back from Nshili in Gikongoro at the Burundi border, travelling through Butare. Everywhere people told me of the number of young people who had gone. They said to me [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “Where they are going, and who is taking them . . . why are they are (<i>sic</i>) not arrested as well as their families?” So I will tell you now, it is written in the law, in the book of the Penal Code: [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “Every person who recruits soldiers by seeking them in the population, seeking young persons everywhere whom they will give to the foreign armed forces attacking the Republic, shall be liable to death”.

In English, this means that [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “JUSTICE IS RENDERED IN THE PEOPLE’S NAME”. If justice therefore is no longer serving the people, as written in our Constitution which we voted for ourselves, this means that at that point we who also make up the population whom it is supposed to serve, we must do something ourselves to exterminate this rabble.

They separated the M.D.R. people. You will imagine, those from the P.L. they separated, and even the others who pass for Christians were placed on one side. When an M.R.N.D. member showed his card, he was immediately shot; I am not lying to you, they even tell you on the radio; they shot this man and disappeared into the Kigali marshes to escape, after saying they were “Inkotanyis”. So tell me, these young people who acquire our identity cards, then they come back armed with guns on behalf of the “Inyenzis” or their accomplices to shoot us! — I do not think we are going to allow then (<i>sic</i>) to shoot us! Let no more local representatives of the M.D.R. live in this commune or in this prefecture, because they are accomplices! The representatives of those parties who collaborate with the “Inyenzis”, those who represent them . . . I am telling you, and I am not lying, it is . . . they only want to exterminate us. They only want to exterminate us: they have no other aim. We must tell them the truth. I am not hiding anything at all from them. That is in fact the aim they are pursuing. I would tell you, therefore, that the representatives of those parties collaborating with the “Inyenzis”, namely the M.D.R., P.L., P.S.D., P.D.C. and other splinter groups you run into here and there, who are connected and who are only wandering about, all these parties and their representatives must go to live in Kayanzi with Nsengiyaremye: in that way we will know where the people we are at war with are.</p>

However, what I will tell you is that the delegates you will hear are in Arusha do not represent Rwanda. They do not represent all of Rwanda, I tell you that as a fact. The delegates from Rwanda, who are said to be from Rwanda, are led by an “Inyenzi”, who is there to discuss with “Inyenzis”, as it says in a song you hear from time to time, where it states [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “He is God born of God”. In the same way, they are [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “Inyenzis born of Inyenzis, who speak for Inyenzis”. As to what they are going to say in Arusha, it is exactly what these “Inyenzi” accomplices living here went to Brussels to say. They are going to work in Arusha so everything would be attributed to Rwanda, while there was nothing not from Brussels that happened there! Even what came from Rwanda did not entirely come from our government: it was a Brussels affair which they put on their heads to take with them to Arusha! So it was one “Inyenzi” dealing with another! As for what they call “discussions”, we are not against discussions. I have to tell you that they do not come from Rwanda: they are “Inyenzis” who conduct discussions with “Inyenzis”, and you must know that once and for all!

She had no other reason for going there but to drive out the inspectors and teachers who were there and who were not in her party. You have heard what happened in Minitrape: it was not just a diversion, they even went after our workers! You have heard what happened at the radio, and the Byumba program that was cancelled. You have heard how all this happened. I have to tell you that we must ask our Ministers that they too, there are people working for their parties and who are in our Ministries. . . . For example, you have heard mention of the Militant‑Minister Ngirabatware, who is not present here because the country has given him an important mission. I visited his Ministry on Thursday. There was a little handful of people there, I am not exaggerating because I am in the M.R.N.D., (a handful of) some people from the M.R.N.D., those who were there were exclusively “Inyenzis” belonging to the P.L. and the M.D.R.! Those are the ones who are in the Planning Ministry! You will understand that if this Minister said: [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “If you touch our inspectors, I will also liquidate yours”, what would happen?

-22.5pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">26.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am telling you is, we have to rise up, we must really rise up. I will end with an important thing. Yesterday I was in Nshili, you learned that the Barundis slandered us, I went to find out the truth. Before I went there, people told me that I would not come back. That I would die there. I replied [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “If I die, I will not be the first victim to be sacrificed”. In Nshili they fired the mayor who was there before, apparently on the pretext that he was old! — that he began working in 1960! I saw him yesterday, and he was still a young man! — but because he was in the M.R.N.D., he left! They wanted to put in a thief; that didn’t work either. When they put in an honest man, they (the public) refused him! Now, this commune known as Nshili is administered by a consultant who also has no idea what to do! At this place called Nshili, we have armed forces of the country who are guarding the border. There are people known as the J.D.R. for the good reason that our national soldiers are disciplined and do not shoot anyone, especially they would not shoot a Rwandan, unless he was an “Inyenzi”, these soldiers did not know that everyone in the M.D.R. had become “Inyenzis”! They did not know it! They surrounded them and arrested our police, so that a citizen who was not in our party personally told me [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “What I want is for them to hold elections so we can elect a mayor. Otherwise, before he comes, let us provisionally put back the person who was there before because from the state things are in, he will not be able to put people on the right path again”.</span></p>

-22.5pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">27.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear relations, dear brothers, I would like to say something important to you: elections must be held, we must all vote. As you are now all together here, has anyone scratched anyone else? They talk of security. They say we cannot vote. Are we not going to mass on Sunday? Did you not come here to the meeting? In the M.R.N.D., did you not elect the incumbents at all levels? Even those who say this, did they not do the same thing? Did they not vote? On the pretext they suggest, there is no reason preventing us from voting on security grounds, because those who are going about the country and the troubles which have occurred, it is those who provoke them. That is the word I would say to you: they are all misleading us: even here where we are, we can vote.</span></p>

-22.5pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, they are relying on the war refugees in Byumba. I should tell you that no one went to ask those people if they did not want to vote. They told me personally that they previously had lazy counsellors, that even some of their mayors were lazy. Since the Ministry which gives them what they live on is supervised by an “Inkotanyi”, or rather by the “Inyenzi” Lando, he chose people known as “Inyenzis” and their accomplices who are in this country, and gave them the job of taking food supplies to those people. Instead of taking it to them there, they sold it so they could buy ammunition which they gave to the “Inyenzis” who have been shooting us!&nbsp; I should tell you that they said [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “They shoot us from behind and you shoot us from in front by sending us this rabble to bring us food supplies”. I had no answer to give them, and they went on [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “What we want, they said, is that from ourselves, we can elect incumbents, advisors, cell leaders, a mayor; we can know he is with us here in the camp, he protects us, he gets us food supplies”. You will understand that what I was told by these men and women who fled in such circumstances as you hear about from time to time, on all sides, was that they also wanted elections: the whole country wants elections so that they will be led by good people as was always the case. Believe me, what we should all do, that is what we should do, we should call for elections. So in order to conclude, I would remind you of all the important things I have just spoken to you about: the most essential is that we should not allow ourselves to be invaded, lest the very persons who are collapsing take away some of you. Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck. Let me tell you, these people should begin leaving while there is still time and go and live with their people, or even go to the “Inyenzis”, instead of living among us and keeping their guns, so that when we are asleep they can shoot us. Let them pack their bags, let them get going, so that no one will return here to talk and no one will bring scraps claiming to be flags!</span></p>

Our inspectors are going nowhere. Those whom they have placed will set out for Nyaruhengeri, to Minister Agathe’s home, to look after the education of her children! Let her keep them! I will end with one important thing: elections. Thank you for listening to me and I also thank you for your courage, in your arms and in your hearts. I know you are men, you are young women, fathers and mothers of families, who will not allow yourselves to be invaded, who will reject contempt. May your lives be long!</p>
