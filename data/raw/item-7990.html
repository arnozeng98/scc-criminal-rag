 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insofar as the authorities suggest that s.&nbsp;16(3) requires an abstract understanding of the obligation to tell the truth, they should be rejected. &nbsp;That requirement was based on a version of s.&nbsp;16 that explicitly required that the witness “understands the duty of speaking the truth”. &nbsp;Although Parliament deleted that requirement in 1987, courts continued to require proof that child witnesses understood the duty to tell the truth. &nbsp;Parliament responded by enacting s.&nbsp;16.1(7), which expressly forbade such inquiries of child witnesses. &nbsp;However, the existence of the s.&nbsp;16.1(7) ban does not require us to infer that mentally disabled adults are to be questioned on the obligation to tell the truth. &nbsp;First, because s.&nbsp;16(3) only required a promise to tell the truth, Parliament had no need to ban such questioning of adult witnesses with mental disabilities. &nbsp;Second, s.&nbsp;16(3) required only a promise to tell the truth, so there was no need for Parliament to enact a similar provision with respect to s.&nbsp;16(3). &nbsp;Third, the enactment of s.&nbsp;16.1(7) did not imply that the earlier judicial interpretation of s.&nbsp;16(3) as it applied to children had been endorsed for adult witnesses. &nbsp;No inference as to the meaning of s.&nbsp;16(3) flows from the mere adoption of s.&nbsp;16.1(7) with respect to children, and the re‑enactment of s.&nbsp;16(3) does not imply that Parliament accepted the judicial interpretation that prevailed at the time of the re‑enactment. &nbsp;Fourth, the fact that s.&nbsp;16 does not have a provision equivalent to s.&nbsp;16.1(7) does not mean that adult witnesses with mental disabilities must demonstrate an understanding of the nature of the duty to speak the truth — s.&nbsp;16(3) sets two requirements for the competence of adults with mental disabilities, and nothing further need be imported. &nbsp;Fifth, there is no need to prove that, unless it can be shown that adult witnesses with mental disabilities are the same as, or like, child witnesses, they must be subjected to an inquiry into their understanding of the nature of the obligation to tell the truth before they can be held competent to testify.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The underlying policy concerns — bringing the abusers to justice, ensuring fair trials and preventing wrongful convictions — also support allowing adults with mental disabilities to testify. &nbsp;With respect to the first concern, rejecting the evidence of alleged victims on the ground that they cannot explain the nature of the obligation to tell the truth in philosophical terms would exclude reliable and relevant evidence, immunize an entire category of offenders from criminal responsibility for their acts, and further marginalize the already vulnerable victims of sexual predators. &nbsp;With respect to the second, allowing an adult witness with mental disabilities to testify when the witness can communicate the evidence and promises to tell the truth does not render a trial unfair. &nbsp;Generally, the reliability threshold is met by establishing that the witness has the capacity to understand and answer the questions put to her and by bringing home the need to tell the truth by securing an oath, affirmation or promise. &nbsp;There is no guarantee that any witness will tell the truth — the trial process seeks a basic indication of reliability. &nbsp;That, along with the rules governing admissibility and weight of the evidence work to ensure that a verdict of guilty is based on accurate and credible evidence and that the accused has a fair trial.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When applying s.&nbsp;16(3) in the context of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, eight considerations are appropriate. &nbsp;First, the <i>voir dire </i>on the competence of a proposed witness is an independent inquiry: it may not be combined with a <i>voir dire </i>on other issues. &nbsp;Second, the <i>voir dire </i>should be brief, but not hasty. &nbsp;It is preferable to hear all available relevant evidence that can be reasonably considered before preventing a witness to testify. &nbsp;Third, the primary source of evidence for a witness’s competence is the witness herself. &nbsp;Her examination should be permitted. &nbsp;Questioning an adult with mental disabilities requires consideration and accommodation for her particular needs; questions should be phrased patiently in a clear, simple manner. &nbsp;Fourth, persons familiar with the proposed witness in her everyday situation understand her best. &nbsp;They may be called as fact witnesses to provide evidence on her development. &nbsp;Fifth, expert evidence may be adduced if it meets the criteria for admissibility, but preference should always be given to expert witnesses who have had personal and regular contact with the proposed witness. &nbsp;Sixth, the trial judge must make two inquiries during the <i>voir dire </i>on competence: (a)&nbsp;does the proposed witness understand the nature of an oath or affirmation, and (b)&nbsp;can she communicate the evidence? &nbsp;Seventh, the second inquiry into the witness’s ability to communicate the evidence requires the trial judge to explore in a general way whether she can relate concrete events by understanding and responding to questions. &nbsp;It may be useful to ask if she can differentiate between true and false everyday factual statements. &nbsp;Finally, the witness testifies under oath or affirmation if she passes both parts of the test, and on promising to tell the truth if she passes the second part only.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the instant case, the trial judge erred in failing to consider the second part of the test under s.&nbsp;16. &nbsp;This error of law led him to rule the complainant incompetent. &nbsp;This error cannot be rectified by comments made by the trial judge at other points in the trial or by the doctrine of deference.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%"> Binnie, LeBel and Fish&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting): The majority judgment unacceptably dilutes the protection Parliament intended to provide to accused persons by turning Parliament’s direction permitting a person “whose mental capacity is challenged” to testify only “on promising to tell the truth” into an empty formality — a mere mouthing of the words “I promise” without any inquiry as to whether the promise has any significance to the potential witness &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;text-indent:.5in"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">Section&nbsp;16 mandates a single inquiry which presents the trial judge dealing with a witness whose mental capacity is challenged with three options. &nbsp;Section&nbsp;16(2) provides that, if the challenged witness is able to communicate the evidence and understands the nature of an oath or a solemn declaration</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%"> </span><span style="line-height:200%">in terms of ordinary, everyday social conduct,</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">There is agreement with the majority that promising is an act aimed at bringing home to the witness the seriousness of the situation and the importance of being careful and correct. &nbsp;The promise thus serves a practical, prophylactic purpose. &nbsp;It cannot be correct, however, that it is out of bounds for a trial judge to try to determine — in concrete everyday terms — whether there is in reality such a prophylactic effect in the case of a particular witness whose mental capacity has been challenged. &nbsp;If such a witness is so disabled as not to understand the seriousness of the situation and the importance of being careful and correct, there is no prophylactic effect, and the fair trial interests of the accused under s.&nbsp;16, as enacted in 1987, are unfairly prejudiced.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, when Parliament amended the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> to prohibit asking child witnesses “any questions regarding their understanding of the nature of the promise to tell the truth” (s.&nbsp;16.1(7)), the empirical evidence before Parliament related exclusively to children. &nbsp;No such empirical studies were carried out with respect to adults with mental disabilities. &nbsp;In their case, no “don’t ask” provision was proposed, let alone adopted.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is agreement with the majority that the words “on promising to tell the truth” in s.&nbsp;16(3) must bear the same meaning as “to promise to tell the truth” in s.&nbsp;16.1(6). &nbsp;That being the case, the majority must read the s.&nbsp;16.1(7) “don’t ask” rule applicable only to children into s.&nbsp;16(3) applicable only to mentally challenged adults in order to read down the words “promising to tell the truth” in s.&nbsp;16(3), and thus treat adults with mental disabilities as equivalent for the purposes of s.&nbsp;16 to children without mental disabilities.&nbsp; The fact that psychiatrists speak of persons with mental disabilities in terms of mental ages does not mean that an adult with mental age of six is on the same footing as a six‑year‑old child with no mental disability whatsoever — a six‑year‑old with the mental capacity of a six‑year‑old does not suffer from a mental disability. &nbsp;No evidence was led to suggest equivalence and judicial notice cannot be taken of alleged “facts” that are neither notorious nor easily verifiable from undisputed sources.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a competency <i>voir dire </i>where the mental capacity of an adult is challenged, and the adult is herself called as a proposed witness, the court may admit evidence from fact witnesses personally familiar with the complainant’s verbal and cognitive abilities and limitations to help the court gain a better understanding of the person’s capacity. &nbsp;These witnesses would not be in a position to express an expert opinion, but could testify about their direct personal observations of the proposed witness.&nbsp; Such evidence might, if the trial judge considered it helpful, better enable the judge or jury to appreciate her responses (or non‑responses) in the witness box. &nbsp;However, ultimately, the judge must reach his or her own considered opinion about the mental capacity of the proposed witness prior to admitting the testimony.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge had serious concerns about the complainant’s ability to communicate the evidence. &nbsp;The complainant’s answers to a series of simple and concrete questions left him fully satisfied that she did not understand what a promise to tell the truth involves. &nbsp;Much turned on the significance of the complainant’s repeated “I don’t know” answers. &nbsp;Clearly, it was an important advantage for the trial judge to watch the questions and answers unfold and to assess whether the complainant was actually able to “compute” her responses to what she was being asked. &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:200%">There was no allegation of bad faith, but she may nevertheless have been mistaken in her perception or recollection of events and the crucible of cross‑examination was useless because there was no secure method of testing her credibility.</span><span style="line-height:200%"> &nbsp;<span lang="EN-CA">Her inability to deal with simple questions would mean her evidence would be effectively immune to challenge by the defence, thereby prejudicing the interest of society as well as the accused in a fair trial. &nbsp;Sitting on appeal from this determination, and not having had the advantage of observing and questioning the complainant, there is no valid basis for this Court to reverse the trial judge’s assessment of her mental capacity.</span></span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge’s conclusion that the complainant lacked the ability to perceive, recall and communicate events and to understand the difference between truth and falsehood set up, but did not predetermine, his conclusion that her testimony lacked sufficient reliability. &nbsp;It was neither surprising nor an error however that the trial judge’s reasoning on the threshold reliability in his hearsay ruling was quite similar to his reasoning on the s.&nbsp;16 <i>voir dire</i>, and given his advantage in seeing and hearing the complainant, his exclusion of her out‑of‑court statements should equally be upheld by this Court.</span></p>

K.B., through bodily gestures, described the game as involving touching her breasts and vagina.&nbsp; In her statement to the police, she indicated that D.A.I. had touched her vagina, buttocks and breasts beneath her pajamas, and that this had happened many times.</p>

 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT">II.&nbsp; <u>Legal Analysis</u></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16subsec3" target="_blank">s. 16(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>,<i> </i>it is important to distinguish between three different concepts that are sometimes confused: (1) the witness’s competence to testify; (2) the admissibility of his or her evidence; and (3) the weight of the witness’s testimony.&nbsp; The evidentiary rules governing all three concepts share a common purpose: ensuring that convictions are based on solid evidence and that the accused has a fair trial.&nbsp; However, each concept plays a distinct role in achieving this goal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first concept, and the one most relevant to this appeal, is the principle of competence to testify.&nbsp; Competence addresses the question of whether a proposed witness has the capacity to provide evidence in a court of law.&nbsp; The purpose of this principle is to exclude at the outset worthless testimony, on the ground that the witness lacks the basic capacity to communicate evidence to the court.&nbsp; Competence is a threshold requirement. As a matter of course, witnesses are presumed to possess the basic “capacity” to testify.&nbsp; However, in the case of children or adults with mental disabilities, the party challenging the competence of a witness may be called on to show that there is an issue as to the capacity of the proposed witness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[17]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second concept is admissibility.&nbsp; The rules of admissibility determine what evidence given by a competent witness may be received into the record of the court.&nbsp; Evidence may be inadmissible for various reasons.&nbsp; Only evidence that is relevant to the case may be considered by the judge or jury.&nbsp; Evidence may also be inadmissible if it falls under an exclusionary rule, for example the confessions rule or the rule against hearsay evidence.&nbsp; Among the purposes of the rules of admissibility are improving the accuracy of fact finding, respecting policy considerations, and ensuring the fairness of the trial.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 16(1) sets out what a judge must do when a challenge is raised.&nbsp; First, the judge must determine “whether the person understands the nature of an oath or a solemn declaration” and “whether the person is able to communicate the evidence” (s. 16(1)).&nbsp; If these requirements are met, the witness testifies under oath or affirmation, as other witnesses do (s. 16(2)).&nbsp; If these requirements are not met, the judge moves on to s. 16(3).&nbsp; Section 16(3) provides that “[a] person . . . who does not understand the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation but is able to communicate the evidence may . . . testify on promising to tell the truth.”</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In brief, s. 16(1) provides that an adult witness whose competence to testify is challenged should testify under oath or affirmation, if the witness “understands the nature of an oath or a solemn affirmation” and can “communicate the evidence”.&nbsp; Here K.B. did not meet the first requirement.&nbsp; The inquiry therefore moved to s. 16(3), which states that if an adult witness cannot take the oath or affirm under s. 16(1), then she must be permitted to testify <i>if she is “able to communicate the evidence” and promises to tell the truth. </i>&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On its face, s. 16 says that in a case such as this where the witness cannot take the oath or affirm, the judge has only one further issue to consider — whether the witness can communicate the evidence.&nbsp; If the answer to that question is yes, the judge must then ask the witness whether she promises to tell the truth.&nbsp; If she does, she is competent to testify.&nbsp; It is not necessary to inquire into whether the witness understands the duty to tell the truth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argues, however, that the plain words of s. 16(3) do not suffice.&nbsp; They must be supplemented, he says, by the requirement that an adult witness with mental disabilities who cannot take an oath or affirm must not only be able to communicate the evidence and promise to tell the truth, but must also<i> understand the nature of a promise to tell the truth</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot accept this submission.&nbsp; The words of an Act are to be interpreted in their entire context: <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21.&nbsp; The wording of s. 16(3), its history, its internal logic and its statutory context all point to the conclusion that s. 16(3) should be read as it stands, without reading in a further requirement that the witness demonstrate an understanding of the nature of the obligation to tell the truth.&nbsp; All that is required is that the witness be able to communicate the evidence and in fact promise to tell the truth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as already mentioned, this interpretation goes beyond the words used by Parliament. To insist that the witness demonstrate understanding of the nature of the obligation to tell the truth is to import a requirement into the section that Parliament did not place there.&nbsp; The first and cardinal principle of statutory interpretation is that one must look to the plain words of the provision.&nbsp; Where ambiguity arises, it may be necessary to resort to external factors to resolve the ambiguity: R. Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i> (5th ed. 2008), at p.&nbsp;44.&nbsp; However, Parliament has clearly stated the requirements for finding adult witnesses with mental disabilities to be competent.&nbsp; Section 16 shows no ambiguity.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the history of s. 16 supports the view that Parliament intended to remove barriers that had prevented adults with mental disabilities from testifying prior to the 1987 amendments (S.C. 1987, c. 24).&nbsp; The amendments altered the common law rule, by virtue of which only witnesses under oath could testify.&nbsp; To take the oath or affirm, a witness must have an understanding of the duty to tell the truth: <i>R. v. Brasier</i> (1779), 1 Leach 199, 168 E.R. 202. Adults with mental disabilities might not be able to do this.&nbsp; To remove this barrier, Parliament provided an alternative basis for competence for this class of individuals. Section 16(1) of the 1987 provision continued to maintain the oath or affirmation as the first option for adults with mental disabilities, but s. 16(3) provided for competence based simply on the ability to communicate the evidence and a promise to tell the truth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This history suggests that Parliament intended to eliminate an understanding of the abstract nature of the oath or solemn affirmation as a prerequisite for testimonial capacity.&nbsp; Failure to show that the witness <i>could demonstrate an understanding of the obligation to tell the truth</i> was no longer the end of the matter.&nbsp; Provided the witness (1) was able to <i>communicate the evidence</i>, and (2) promised to tell the truth, she should be allowed to testify.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The drafters of s. 16(3) did not intend this provision to require an abstract understanding of the duty to tell the truth (see Appendix A).&nbsp; The original text of Bill C-15, which adopted the 1987 amendments, was changed by the Legislative Committee on Bill C-15 precisely to avoid that interpretation.&nbsp; The version of s. 16(3) first put before Parliament allowed testimony on promising to tell the truth if the witness was “sufficiently intelligent that the reception of the evidence is justified”.&nbsp; A discussion was held on the meaning of “sufficient intelligence”, after which the Committee concluded that all that was needed for a witness to be sufficiently intelligent was to understand the moral difference between telling the truth and lying.&nbsp; The Committee, fearing that this would open the door to abstract inquiries, ultimately replaced “sufficient intelligence” by “able to communicate the evidence”.&nbsp; The deliberations that followed emphasized the practical ability to communicate the evidence.&nbsp; There was no suggestion that ability to communicate the evidence accompanied by a promise to tell the truth implicitly imposed a requirement that the witness demonstrate a more abstract understanding of the duty to tell the truth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The historic background against which s. 16(3) was enacted explains why Parliament might have wished in 1987 to lower the requirements of testimonial competence for adults with mental disabilities, who are nonetheless capable of communicating the evidence.&nbsp; While adults with mental disabilities received little consideration in the pre-1987 case law, the inappropriateness of questioning children on abstract understandings of the truth had been noted and criticized.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Bannerman</i> (1966), 48 C.R. 110 (Man. C.A.), Dickson J. <i>ad&nbsp;hoc </i>(as he then was) rejected the practice of examining child witnesses on their religious beliefs and the philosophical meaning of truth.&nbsp; Meanwhile, awareness of the sexual abuse of children and adults with mental disabilities was growing.&nbsp; To rule out the evidence of children and adults with mental disabilities at the stage of competence — the effect of the requirement of an abstract understanding of the nature of the obligation to tell the truth — meant their stories would never be told and their cases never prosecuted.&nbsp; These concerns explain why Parliament moved to simplify the competence test for adult witnesses with mental disabilities.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, and flowing from this history, the internal logic of s. 16 negates the suggestion that “promising to tell the truth” in s. 16(3) must be read as implying an understanding of the obligation to tell the truth.&nbsp; Two procedures are provided by s. 16.&nbsp; The preferred option is testimony under oath or affirmation (s. 16(1)), and the alternative procedure is testimony on a promise to tell the truth (s. 16(3)).&nbsp; If the witness is required under s. 16(3) to demonstrate that she understands the obligation to tell the truth, s. 16(3) adds little, if anything, to s. 16(1).&nbsp; In both cases, the witness is required to articulate abstract concepts of the nature of truth and the nature of the obligation to tell the truth in court.&nbsp; The result is essentially to render s. 16(3) a dead letter and to negate the dual structure of the provision.&nbsp; This runs against the principle of statutory interpretation that Parliament does not speak in vain: <i><span lang="EN-CA">Attorney General of Quebec v. Carrières Ste-Thérèse Ltée</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">, [1985] 1&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;831, at p. 838</span>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, s. 16(4) indicates that ability to communicate the evidence is the only quality that an adult with mental disabilities must possess in order to testify under s. 16(3).&nbsp; Section 16(4) provides that the proposed witness is unable to testify if she neither understands the nature of an oath or solemn affirmation nor is able to communicate the evidence.&nbsp; It follows that the witness is competent to testify if she is able to communicate the evidence; she may testify on promising to tell the truth under s. 16(3).&nbsp; The qualities envisaged in s. 16 as basis for testimonial competence are mentioned in s. 16(4).&nbsp; Imposing an additional qualitative requirement to understand the nature of a promise to tell the truth would flout the utility of s. 16(4).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the legislative context speaks against reading s. 16(3) as requiring that an adult witness with mental disabilities understand the nature of the obligation to tell the truth.&nbsp; If this requirement is added to s. 16(3), the result is a different standard for the competence of adults with mental disabilities under s. 16(3) and children under s. 16.1 (enacted in 2005 (S.C. 2005, c. 32) pursuant to the “Brief on Bill C-2: Recognizing the Capacities &amp; Needs of Children as Witnesses in Canada’s Criminal Justice System” (Child Witness Project, March 2005) (the “Bala Report”)).&nbsp; As will be discussed more fully below, s.&nbsp;16(3) governing the competence of adults with mental disabilities, and ss.&nbsp;16.1(3), (5) and (6) governing the competence of children, set forth essentially the same requirements.&nbsp; Broadly speaking, both condition testimonial capacity on: (1) the ability to communicate or answer questions; and (2) a promise to tell the truth.&nbsp; While it was open to Parliament to enact different requirements for children and adults with the minds of children, consistency of Parliamentary intent should be assumed, absent contrary indications.&nbsp; No explanation has been offered as to why Parliament would consider a promise to tell the truth a meaningful procedure for children, but an empty gesture for adults with mental disabilities.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foregoing reasons make a strong case that s. 16(3) should be read as requiring only two requirements for competence of an adult with mental disabilities: (1) ability to communicate the evidence; and (2) a promise to tell the truth.&nbsp; However, two arguments have been raised in opposition to this interpretation: first, without a further requirement of an understanding of the obligation to tell the truth, a promise to tell the truth is an “empty gesture”; second, Parliament’s failure in 2005 to extend to adults with mental disabilities the s. 16.1(7) prohibition on the questioning of children means that it intended this questioning to continue for adults.&nbsp; I will examine each argument in turn.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[35]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first argument is that unless an adult witness with mental disabilities is required to demonstrate that she understands the nature of the obligation to tell the truth, the promise is an “empty gesture”.&nbsp; However, this submission’s shortcoming is that it departs from the plain words of s. 16(3), on the basis of an assumption that is unsupported by any evidence and contrary to Parliament’s intent.&nbsp; Imposing an additional qualitative condition for competence that is not provided in the text of s. 16(3) would demand compelling demonstration that a promise to tell the truth cannot amount to a meaningful procedure for adults with mental disabilities.&nbsp; No such demonstration has been made.&nbsp; On the contrary, common sense suggests that the act of promising to tell the truth may be useful, even in the absence of the witness’s ability to explain what telling the truth means in abstract terms.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Promising is an act aimed at bringing home to the witness the seriousness of the situation and the importance of being careful and correct.&nbsp; The promise thus serves a practical, prophylactic purpose.&nbsp; A witness who is able to communicate the evidence, as required by s. 16(3), is necessarily able to relate events.&nbsp; This in turn implies an understanding of what really happened — i.e. the truth — as opposed to fantasy.&nbsp; When such a witness promises to tell the truth, this reinforces the seriousness of the occasion and the need to do so.&nbsp; In dealing with the evidence of children in s. 16.1, Parliament held that a promise to tell the truth was all that is required of a child capable of responding to questions.&nbsp; Parliament did not think a child’s promise, without more, is an empty gesture.&nbsp; Why should it be otherwise for an adult with the mental ability of a child?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second argument raised in support of the proposition that “promising to tell the truth” in s. 16(3) implies a requirement that the witness must show that she understands the nature of the obligation to tell the truth is that Parliament has not enacted a ban on questioning adult witnesses with mental disabilities on the nature of the obligation to tell the truth, as it did for child witnesses in 2005 in s. 16.1(7).&nbsp; To understand this argument, we must briefly trace the history of s. 16.1.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005, following the Bala Report, Parliament once more modified the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>’s provisions on testimonial competence, but this time only with respect to children.&nbsp; The central focus of the 2005 legislation relating to the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>was the competence of <i>child</i> witnesses, with the aim of altering the restrictive gloss the case law had placed on the previous provisions relating to the capacity of children to testify.&nbsp; Chief among this case law was <i>R. v. Khan </i>(1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 197 (Ont. C.A.), which insisted that a child understand the nature of the obligation to tell the truth before the child could testify.&nbsp; <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16.1" target="_blank">Section 16.1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, in unequivocal language, rejected this requirement.&nbsp; It stated:</p>

My concern is that some judge might read this — and we have quite a lot of case law about this — and say, okay, I can't ask you about your understanding of the nature of the promise, but what about asking you questions about truth-telling? Parliament specifically said in subsection 16.1(6) that you’ll be required to promise to tell the truth.

This can be demonstrated through a simple line of questioning directed to whether the child understands the difference between the truth and a lie, knows that it is wrong to lie, understands the necessity to tell the truth, and promises to do so.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This oft-cited statement of the law proved difficult to apply.&nbsp; The first sentence suggests that the threshold for testimonial competence is low, based on truth telling in “everyday social conduct”.&nbsp; This suggests that the judge need only be satisfied that the witness understands the difference between truth and falsehood in relation to everyday matters and activities <span lang="EN-CA">— not in some abstract metaphysical sense.&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-CA">The second sentence in this passage from <i>Khan</i>, specifically the phrases “knows that it is <u>wrong</u> to lie” and “understands the <u>necessity</u> to tell the truth” (emphases added), move beyond everyday social conduct into more abstract, philosophical realms.&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>obiter</i>, Robins J.A. opined that the same test should be applied to the post-1987 section, on the grounds that without the requirement that the witness understand what a promise is and the importance of keeping it, the promise would be an “empty gesture”.</span></p>

Farley</i> (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 445, the Ontario Court of Appeal adopted this <i>obiter dictum</i> and applied it to the post-1987 version of s. 16(3), the provision applicable in this case.&nbsp; Other provincial courts of appeal followed suit: <i>R. v. P.M.F.</i> (1992), 115 N.S.R. (2d) 38; <i>R. v. McGovern</i> (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 301 (Man.); <i>R. v. S.M.S.</i> (1995), 160 N.B.R. (2d) 182.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Rockey</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 829, a minority of this Court, <i>per </i>McLachlin J., held that a child was incompetent to testify on the basis of his inability to <i>communicate</i> the evidence, referring to <i>Farley </i>with approval; the question of whether s. 16(3) incorporated the <i>Khan</i> test was not at issue in that case.&nbsp; Appellate courts continue to require demonstration of an understanding of the duty to speak the truth under s. 16(3): <i>R. v. Ferguson</i> (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 342 (B.C.); <i>R. v. Parrott</i> (1999), 175 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 89 (Nfld.); <i>R. v. A. (K.)</i> (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 554 (Ont.); <i>R. v. R.J.B.</i>, 2000 ABCA 103, 255 A.R. 301; <i>R. v. Brouillard</i>, 2006 QCCA 1263, 44 C.R. (6th) 218; <i>R. v. E.E.D.</i>, 2007 SKCA 99, 304 Sask. R. 192.&nbsp; In the case at bar, the Ontario Court of Appeal affirmed that view, upholding the trial judge’s insistence on the understanding of the duty to speak the truth not merely in “everyday social conduct”, but on an understanding of the duty <i>abstracted</i> from everyday situations.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the first case in which this Court has been squarely called upon to interpret <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16subsec3" target="_blank">s. 16(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and confront the legacy of the <i>obiter dicta </i>in <i>Khan</i>.&nbsp; In my view, the test proposed in <i>Khan</i> is unhelpful and inapplicable, insofar as it is read as requiring or condoning an abstract inquiry into the nature of the obligation to tell the truth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First and foremost, <i>Khan</i> was concerned with a substantially different pre-1987 version of s. 16, which was adopted in 1893 and which explicitly required that the proposed witness “understands the duty of speaking the truth”.&nbsp; The current provision requires only that the witness be able to communicate the evidence and promise to tell the truth.&nbsp; It speaks only of two practical, less abstract, requirements — the ability to communicate the evidence and a promise to tell the truth.&nbsp; In short, <i>Khan</i> imposed a requirement to demonstrate understanding of the nature of the obligation to tell the truth, based on the phrase “understands the duty of speaking the truth”.&nbsp; That phrase has been removed from the current s. 16(3).&nbsp; It follows that <i>Khan</i> simply does not apply to this case, and that the <i>obiter dictum</i> in <i>Khan</i> suggesting that it does should be rejected.&nbsp; In 1987, Parliament deleted the requirement of understanding the nature of the duty to tell the truth.&nbsp; Judges should not bring it back in.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the <i>Khan</i> test, as already noted, is ambivalent.&nbsp; It first suggests that all that is required is an understanding of the duty to speak the truth “in terms of ordinary everyday social conduct” (p. 206).&nbsp; However, it then goes on to illustrate this test in terms abstracted from everyday social conduct.&nbsp; In my view, the former approach is preferable.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This lower threshold recognizes that witnesses of limited mental ability, whether by reason of age or disability, understand and articulate events in the concrete terms of the world around them.&nbsp; The capacity to abstract from the concrete and draw generalizations about conduct unrelated to concrete situations typically develops at a later, more advanced stage of mental development.&nbsp; A child or adult with mental disabilities may be able to distinguish between what is true and false or right and wrong in a particular situation, yet lack the ability to articulate in general language the reasons for this understanding.&nbsp; To insist on the articulation of the nature of the obligation to tell the truth, abstracted from particular situations, may result in the witness’s evidence being excluded, even though it is reliable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, as discussed above, Parliament’s response to <i>Khan</i>’s insistence on an understanding of the duty to speak the truth in abstract terms and the metaphysical questioning this insistence gave rise to, was to expressly forbid such inquiries in the case of children by enacting s. 16.1(7) in 2005.&nbsp; Why then, one may ask, should courts struggle to read a contrary purpose into the plain language of s. 16, which requires only a concrete inquiry into whether the proposed witness can communicate the evidence and a promise to tell the truth?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that, insofar as the authorities suggest that “promising to tell the truth” in s. 16(3) should be read as requiring an abstract inquiry into an understanding of the obligation to tell the truth, they should be rejected.&nbsp; All that is required is that the witness be able to communicate the evidence and promise to tell the truth.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT">D.&nbsp; <i>Policy Considerations</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have concluded that s. 16(3) imposes two requirements for the testimonial competence of an adult with mental disabilities: (1) the ability to communicate the evidence; and (2) a promise to tell the truth.&nbsp; It is unnecessary and indeed undesirable to conduct an abstract inquiry into whether the witness generally understands the difference between truth and falsity and the obligation to give true evidence in court.&nbsp; Mentally limited people may well understand the difference between the truth and a lie and know they should tell the truth, without being able to articulate in general terms the nature of truth or why and how it fastens on the conscience in a court of law.&nbsp; Section 16(3), in assessing the witness’s capacity, focuses on the concrete acts of communicating and promising.&nbsp; The witness is not required to explain the difference between the truth and a lie, or what makes a promise binding.&nbsp; I have argued that this result follows from the plain words of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16" target="_blank">s. 16<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, and that judges should not by implication add other elements to the dual requirements of an ability to communicate evidence and a promise to tell the truth imposed by s. 16(3).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The discussion of the proper interpretation of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16subsec3" target="_blank">s. 16(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> would not be complete, however, without addressing the policy concerns underlying the issue.&nbsp; Two potentially conflicting policies are in play.&nbsp; The first is the social need to bring to justice those who sexually abuse people of limited mental capacity — a vulnerable group all too easily exploited.&nbsp; The second is to ensure a fair trial for the accused and to prevent wrongful convictions.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first policy consideration is self-evident and requires little amplification.&nbsp; Those with mental disabilities are easy prey for sexual abusers.&nbsp; In the past, mentally challenged victims of sexual offences have been frequently precluded from testifying, not on the ground that they could not relate what happened, but on the ground that they lacked the capacity to articulate in abstract terms the difference between the truth and a lie and the nature of the obligation imposed by promising to tell the truth.&nbsp; As discussed earlier, such witnesses may well be capable of telling the truth and in fact understanding that when they do promise, they should tell the truth.&nbsp; To reject this evidence on the ground that they cannot explain the nature of the obligation to tell the truth in philosophical terms that even those possessed of normal intelligence may find challenging is to exclude reliable and relevant evidence and make it impossible to bring to justice those charged with crimes against the mentally disabled.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[67]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The inability to prosecute such crimes and see justice done, whatever the outcome, may be devastating to the family of the alleged victim, and to the victim herself.&nbsp; But the harm does not stop there.&nbsp; To set the bar too high for the testimonial competence of adults with mental disabilities is to permit violators to sexually abuse them with near impunity.&nbsp; It is to jeopardize one of the fundamental desiderata of the rule of law: that the law be enforceable. It is also to effectively immunize an entire category of offenders from criminal responsibility for their acts and to further marginalize the already vulnerable victims of sexual predators.&nbsp; Without a realistic prospect of prosecution, they become fair game for those inclined to abuse.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is neither necessary nor wise to enter on the vast subject of what constitutes a fair trial.&nbsp; One searches in vain for exhaustive definitions in the jurisprudence.&nbsp; Rather, the approach taken in the jurisprudence is to ask whether particular rules or occurrences render a trial unfair.&nbsp; It is from that perspective that we must approach this issue in this case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question is this: Does allowing an adult witness with mental disabilities to testify when the witness can communicate the evidence and promises to tell the truth render a trial unfair?&nbsp; In my view, the answer to this question is no.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The common law, upon which our current rules of evidence are founded, recognized a variety of rules governing the capacity to testify in different circumstances.&nbsp; The golden thread uniting these varying and different rules is the principle that the evidence must meet a minimal threshold or reliability as a condition of being heard by a judge or jury.&nbsp; Generally speaking, this threshold of reliability is met by establishing that the witness has the capacity to understand and answer the questions put to her, and by bringing home to the witness the need to tell the truth by securing an oath, affirmation or promise.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that any witness —<span lang="EN-CA"> even those of normal intelligence who can take the oath or affirm —</span> will in fact tell the truth, all the truth, or nothing but the truth.&nbsp; What the trial process seeks is merely a basic indication of reliability.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many cases, including <i>Khan</i>, have warned against setting the threshold for the testimonial competence too high for adults with mental disabilities: <i>R. v. Caron</i> (1994), 72 O.A.C. 287; <i>Farley</i>; <i>Parrott</i>.&nbsp; This reflects the fact that such witnesses may be capable of giving useful, relevant and reliable evidence.&nbsp; It also reflects the fact that allowing the witness to testify is only the first step in the process.&nbsp; The witness’s evidence will be tested by cross-examination.&nbsp; The trier of fact will observe the witness’s demeanour and the way she answers the questions.&nbsp; The result may be that the trier of fact does not accept the witness’s evidence, accepts only part of her evidence, or reduces the weight accorded to her evidence.&nbsp; This is a task that judges and juries perform routinely in a myriad of cases involving witnesses of unchallenged as well as challenged mental ability.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The requirement that the witness be able to communicate the evidence and promise to tell the truth satisfies the low threshold for competence in cases such as this.&nbsp; Once the witness is allowed to testify, the ultimate protection of the accused’s right to a fair trial lies in the rules governing admissibility of evidence and in the judge’s or jury’s duty to carefully assess and weigh the evidence presented.&nbsp; Together, these additional safeguards offer ample protection against the risk of wrongful conviction.</p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Inquiries into the witness’s understanding of the nature of the obligation this promise imposes are neither necessary nor appropriate.&nbsp; It is appropriate to question the witness on her ability to tell the truth in concrete factual circumstances, in order to determine if she can communicate the evidence.&nbsp; It is also appropriate to ask the witness whether she in fact promises to tell the truth.&nbsp; However, s. 16(3) does not require that an adult with mental disabilities demonstrate an understanding of the nature of the truth <i>in abstracto</i>, or an appreciation of the moral and religious concepts associated with truth telling.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Having questioned [K.B.] at length I am fully satisfied that [K.B.] <u>has not satisfied the prerequisite that she understands the duty to speak to the truth</u>. She cannot communicate what truth involves or what a lie involves, or what consequences result from truth or lies, and in such circumstances, quite independent of the evidence of [Dr. K.], I am not satisfied that she can be permitted to testify <u>under a promise to tell the truth</u>.

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">This approach (adopted at a time before the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> introduced its present distinction between children and adults with challenged mental capacity) gives meaningful content to the statutory language while recognizing that the “simple line of questioning” is to be factual, not metaphysical.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An appreciation of the assumption of “a moral obligation” or “getting a hold on the conscience of the witness” or . . .&nbsp; an “appreciation of the solemnity of the occasion” or an awareness of an added duty to tell the truth over and above the ordinary duty to do so are <u>all matters involving abstract concepts which are not material to a determination of whether a child’s unsworn evidence may be received</u>.&nbsp; A child need not comprehend “what it is to tell the truth in court” or to appreciate “what happens when you tell a lie in the courtroom” before he or she can give unsworn evidence.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; pp. 205-6.]&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Therefore, I have no disagreement with the Chief&nbsp;Justice insofar as she affirms the existing law that the judge’s inquiry should not ask the potential witness to “articulate abstract concepts” (para. 31) or tell what “the truth means in abstract terms” (para. 35) or venture into “abstract, philosophical realms” (para. 56) or conduct “an abstract inquiry into the nature of the obligation to tell the truth” (para. 58).&nbsp; Nor did <i>Khan</i>, or McLachlin J. in <i>Rockey</i>, in my view, “insist on the articulation of the nature of the obligation to tell the truth, abstracted from particular situations” (para. 61).&nbsp; On the contrary, it seems to me that <i>Khan</i> affirms — not denies — that “[i]t is unnecessary and indeed undesirable to conduct an abstract inquiry” (para. 64).&nbsp; At no point does <i>Khan</i> require an explanation of “the nature of the obligation to tell the truth in philosophical terms” (para. 66).&nbsp; The reasons of McLachlin J. in the later case of <i>Rockey</i> expressed no disagreement with the <i>Khan</i> approach.&nbsp; It is the present majority opinion that effects a marked departure from the existing jurisprudence.</p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">No such empirical studies were carried out with respect to adults with mental disabilities.&nbsp; In their case, there was no “don’t ask” equivalent to s. 16.1(7) even proposed, let alone adopted.&nbsp; As the Chief Justice emphasizes, the 2005 amendments deal with “children, and only children” (para. 41).</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the difference is that a six-year-old with the mental capacity of a six-year-old does not suffer from a mental disability.&nbsp; The fact that psychiatrists speak of persons with mental disabilities calibrated in terms of mental ages is a useful way of describing the relative extent and severity of a person’s disability, but it does not mean that a 22-year-old woman with a severe mental disability is on the same footing as a six-year-old child with no mental disability whatsoever, and of course the empirical evidence before Parliament in 2005 did not suggest otherwise.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span lang="EN-CA">[129]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The rhetorical question posed by the Chief Justice seeks to reverse the onus of proof.&nbsp; It <i>presumes</i> without proof the fact of equivalence and demands a rebuttal, but it was for the government to persuade Parliament, if it could, that there is no relevant difference between an adult with a severe mental disability and a child with no mental disability.&nbsp; It made no effort to do so because there was no evidence on which such an argument <i>could</i> have been made.</span></p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">This evidence, given earlier at the preliminary inquiry, was properly considered by the trial judge at the subsequent competency hearing.</span></p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">At the conclusion of K.B.’s testimony, the trial judge ruled her unsworn testimony to be inadmissible.&nbsp; He explained:</span></p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">Contrary to the majority opinion, I do not read the trial judge’s assessment as based on K.B.’s inability to articulate concepts.&nbsp; It was based on her inability </span><span lang="EN-CA">―</span><span lang="EN-CA"> by virtue of her mental disability </span><span lang="EN-CA">―</span><span lang="EN-CA"> to “understand what a promise to tell the truth involves”.&nbsp; The trial judge made the sort of practical inquiry in everyday terms that <i>Khan</i> required.&nbsp; </span></p>

Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9; <i>R. v.

Professor Bala expressed his fears about the “sufficient intelligence” requirement for testimonial capacity as understood by the Committee, and he proposed replacing it with the ability to communicate criterion:</span></p>

A layperson or indeed even a lawyer not familiar with the case law might think well, of course, you are not going to want to hear from a child not sufficiently intelligent enough to testify. But when one starts looking at the case law and when one realizes that the concept of “sufficient intelligence” is one which appears in the present <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16" target="_blank">section 16<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, one realizes it therefore will be brought to the courts with all the precedents decided and all the traditions decided. That will make it very difficult for children to testify; in particular children under 10 may well be considered, for example, to be of average intelligence, but not of sufficient intelligence to testify.</span></p>

Obviously a prosecutor who is calling a child as a witness is not going to do that unless the prosecutor is satisfied the child has something to say of value and some recollection of the events, and is not going to be wasting everybody’s time.</span></p>

The original intent of the provision was to allow challenged witnesses to testify by merely promising to tell the truth, once they were held to be able to communicate the evidence. This discussion, which occurred on March 24, 2005, shows that s. 16.1(7) was aimed at clarifying the state of the law:</span></p>

My concern is that some judge might read this — and we have quite a lot of case law about this — and say, okay, I can’t ask you about your understanding of the nature of the promise, but what about asking you questions about truth-telling? Parliament specifically said in subsection 16.1(6) that you’ll be required to promise to tell the truth. We can’t ask about the nature of the promise, but can we ask you about “truth” and “lie”? </span></p>

There is a current section 16 that requires the judge to conduct a two-part inquiry whether they are dealing with a person who has some mental disabilities or whether they are dealing with a child under 14. The two-part inquiry requires the judge to first determine, in the case of a child, whether the child understands the nature of an oath or the nature of a solemn affirmation and, second, to determine if the child is able to communicate the evidence. These amendments were made in 1988 with the purpose of trying to more readily permit children’s evidence to be received. However, as the cases have interpreted this provision, we have not seen that ready acceptance of children’s evidence.</p>
