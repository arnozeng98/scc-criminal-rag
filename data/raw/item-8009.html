 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the verdict was one a judge could reasonably render, and the trial judge did not draw an inference or make a finding of fact that was plainly contradicted by the evidence or was incompatible with evidence that was not otherwise contradicted or rejected.&nbsp; Furthermore, the trial judge’s assessment of the witnesses’ credibility was reasonable.&nbsp; The trial judge did not disregard the flaws in M.L.’s testimony, nor did he err either in taking into account her age and the time elapsed since the incidents in question or in assessing G.L.’s testimony. </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> LeBel and Fish&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting): &nbsp;Even when viewed through the mandatory lens of deference, the trial judge’s reasons do not resist scrutiny.&nbsp; On the record, no trier of fact could reasonably conclude that R.P. is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offence.&nbsp; The trial judge’s finding that there was no inconsistency between the testimony of G.L. and M.L. was plainly incompatible with the Crown’s case, with the record as a whole and with M.L.’s own evidence.&nbsp; In particular, an integral element of M.L.’s narrative was that R.P. sexually assaulted her while his wife was about to leave for the hospital to give birth and while she was in the hospital on those occasions.&nbsp; G.L. testified, however, that M.L. had in fact not babysat on either of those occasions and, confronted with this, M.L. did not contradict G.L. M.L. confirmed as well G.L.’s evidence that G.L., when home, had an unobstructed view of the site of the alleged abuses.&nbsp; Also, G.L.’s testimony that R.P. returned home before her very rarely was inconsistent with M.L.’s allegations of regular abuse.&nbsp; The judge also ignored M.L.’s own evidence confirming important aspects of G.L.’s testimony tending to show that R.P. could not have assaulted M.L. as the latter alleged.&nbsp; Finally, to the extent that the trial judge rejected or disregarded the testimony of G.L., he did so for unsustainable reasons.&nbsp; He appears to have given no weight to the testimony because G.L. was too general, which is unsupported by the record, and because she was too precise, which contradicts the first reason.&nbsp; While the judge found that G.L. had chosen to believe R.P. because he was her husband, he disregarded the fact that she was also closely related to M.L., her sister.&nbsp; It was unacceptable to reject, on that ground, the evidence of the only person who could — other than the complainant or the accused — testify to the layout of the homes where the assaults were alleged to have occurred, to R.P.’s daily schedules and routines, and to the circumstances surrounding G.L. giving birth.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, I am of a different view.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that Pelletier J.A., delivering the reasons of the majority, reviewed the evidence in&nbsp; detail. He committed no error in that regard. He was not only entitled <i>but indeed</i> <i>bound</i> to do so:&nbsp; It is well established that reviewing courts, in concluding that a verdict is unreasonable, must articulate as precisely as possible what features of the case support that conclusion.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To this end, a reviewing court must re-examine the entire evidentiary record at trial, consider the effect of its salient elements, and <i>specifically identify</i> aspects of the evidence ― or lack of evidence ― that are of particular concern (<i>R.</i> <i>v. Biniaris</i>, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at paras. 41-42; <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at p. 186).&nbsp; As McLachlin J. (as she then was) stated in <i>R. v. W. (R.)</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 131, “[i]t is thus clear that a court of appeal, in determining whether the trier of fact could reasonably have reached the conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, must re-examine, and to some extent at least, reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence.”</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is precisely what Justice Pelletier did in this case.&nbsp; He took care, repeatedly and expressly, to recognize his duty as an appellate judge to show due deference to the trial judge’s findings of fact. But due deference does not preclude detailed scrutiny of the trial judge’s findings, even as to the credibility of witnesses: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a matter of law it remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable” (<i>W. (R.)</i>,<i> </i>at pp. 131-32).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the majority in the Court of Appeal did not set aside the respondent R.P.’s conviction because it found the complainant insincere or mendacious.&nbsp; Its decision rests instead on a meticulous demonstration that the trial judge ignored or disregarded critical features of the evidence ― including evidence that the complainant herself either confirmed in substance, or did not in fact contradict.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is now well established that where a trial judge draws inferences or makes findings of fact that are contrary to the evidence, he or she engages in an “illogical or irrational reasoning process” that invites appellate intervention (<i>R. v. Sinclair</i>, 2011 SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 15-16).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard, Pelletier J.A. characterized as central to the trial judge’s reasoning ― and therefore decisive ― the trial judge’s findings of fact related to the evidence of the complainant M.L. and that of her sister G.L., the respondent’s wife, who testified for the defendant.&nbsp; In particular, Pelletier J.A. considered unreasonable, because it was contrary to the evidence, the trial judge’s finding that there was no inconsistency between the testimony of G.L. and M.L. (A.R., vol. I, at p. 73; C.A. judgment, at paras. 112-17).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appears to have excused this inconsistency, at least in part, on the strength of jurisprudence which holds that child witnesses, or those testifying to events that occurred while they were children, are not held to the same standard as other witnesses (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 67-69).&nbsp; Yet, the complainant in this case falls into neither category. An adult witness at the time of trial, she was a teenager and not a child of tender years at the time of the alleged offences. Moreover, childhood and the passage of time may well excuse memory gaps or hazy recollection, but not precise allegations that are directly contradicted ― as in this case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we shall presently see, the trial judge erred as well in rejecting G.L.’s evidence for unsustainable reasons. He also ignored M.L.’s own evidence confirming important aspects of G.L.’s testimony tending to show that R.P. could not have assaulted M.L. as the latter alleged.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, I agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal that the trial judge’s reasons do not resist scrutiny, even when viewed through the mandatory lens of deference. I agree as well that, on the record before us, no trier of fact could reasonably conclude that R.P. is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offence with which he was charged.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal.</p>

As we shall see, this was a critical feature of her narrative.&nbsp; And, as we shall see as well, M.L. later conceded that she could not remember whether she ― or someone else ― had in fact babysat when her sister went to the hospital to give birth.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, M.L. testified that R.P. assaulted her regularly while his wife was home as well, with an unobstructed view from their adjacent bedroom and with the door open.&nbsp; As we shall see, M.L. confirmed the evidence of G.L. regarding the layout of the apartment.&nbsp; Moreover, M.L. could not recall the bedroom door <i>ever being closed</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, M.L. testified that R.P. often assaulted her sexually when he returned home before his wife while M.L. was babysitting their children.&nbsp; During that period, said M.L., she normally came over to babysit <span style="font-size:

However, G.L. testified that R.P. almost always went to bed before her because he started work early and she, a housewife, was a late-to-bed type, generally turning in between 11:30 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, G.L. testified that she always kept her bedroom door open in order to hear if the children woke up. M.L. confirmed G.L.’s evidence in this regard and could not recall the bedroom door <i>ever being closed</i> while she was there.&nbsp; Consider also that M.L. testified that, save for one exception she could remember, the abuses <i>always</i> occurred on the couch in the living room. In their home from 1974-1977, the bedroom faced directly on the living room and, lying in her bed, G.L. said she <i>could</i> <i>actually see the living room couch</i>. M.L. also testified that when R.P. would ejaculate on her, she would walk to the bathroom to wash herself, still disrobed. In the couple’s next home, where they lived from 1977-1978, the evidence of G.L. indicated that one had to pass directly in front of the bedroom in order to get to the bathroom, a fact M.L. did not deny when cross-examined in this regard.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One would expect that G.L., a light sleeper suffering from insomnia, would at some point have heard or seen what M.L. alleged was happening, regularly and frequently, a few feet away, within her direct view.&nbsp; But M.L. confirmed that this had never occurred. Nor, according to M.L., were the frequent abuses over a period of almost five years ever once suddenly interrupted because of apprehended discovery.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[50]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third circumstance in which the abuses were alleged to have occurred was on babysitting nights when R.P. would return home before G.L. G.L.’s testimony is inconsistent with M.L.’s allegations of regular abuse in this circumstance because R.P. returned home before G.L. very rarely.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.L. corroborated G.L.’s assertion that the only two reasons for which M.L. was called upon to babysit (unless G.L. and R.P. went out together, in which case the abuse would fall under the second circumstance) was when G.L. was&nbsp; playing bingo or seeing her mother. On these evenings, a babysitter was necessary when R.P. was also out, working as an usher ― which M.L. confirmed. G.L. testified that R.P. worked late, usually until 10:45-11:00 p.m.&nbsp; Regarding the nights when G.L. was seeing her mother, M.L. confirmed G.L.’s evidence that their mother always went to bed early, around 9:30-10:00 p.m.&nbsp; To this extent, M.L. again lent support to G.L.’s evidence that she was likely to get home before R.P. on those nights.&nbsp; Bingo nights, according to G.L., always ended around 10:30 p.m. and it took her 15 minutes to walk home.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general, G.L. was adamant that only rarely did R.P. arrive home before her.&nbsp; Her evidence, once again, stands uncontradicted.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we are left with the fourth circumstance ― sexual assaults alleged by M.L. to have occurred in the car when R.P. drove her home.&nbsp; According to both G.L. and M.L., for the first five years covered by the indictment, 1974-1978, M.L. <i>almost</i> <i>always walked home</i> because the distance was very short. From 1978-1979, the couple lived in a home that was a 20-minute drive from M.L.’s residence.&nbsp; During that period, however, M.L. testified that she babysat relatively infrequently.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent that the trial judge rejected or disregarded the testimony of G.L., he did so for unsustainable reasons.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge faulted G.L. for being suspiciously precise in her recollection of dates and times. It was, he said, [<span style="font-size:
10.0pt;line-height:200%">TRANSLATION</span>] “unlikely that she could remember, thirty (30) years later, so many specific details about the comings and goings of the accused and herself and the times at which they got home” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 73). In fact, <i>nowhere in her evidence</i> does G.L. purport to recall the<span style="font-variant:small-caps"> “</span>specific details” imputed to her by the trial judge. In fact, as the trial judge himself recognized, G.L. repeatedly used terms like “generally, almost always, most of the time, maybe, I don’t remember and approximately” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 73).&nbsp; In short, the trial judge appears to have given no weight to G.L.’s testimony for one reason unsupported by the record, and a second reason that contradicts the first: That she was too general ― and too precise.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge found that G.L. had chosen to believe R.P. because she is <span style="font-variant:small-caps">[</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%">TRANSLATION</span><span style="font-variant:small-caps">] “</span>related” to her husband (A.R., vol. I, at p. 73), disregarding the fact that she was also closely related to the complainant, her sister. It seems to me unacceptable as well to reject on the ground of relationship the evidence of <i>the only person </i>who could ― other than the complainant or the accused ― testify to the layout of their previous homes, to R.P.’s daily schedules and routines, and to the circumstances surrounding her giving birth. &nbsp;And I recall here once again that the <i>complainant confirmed much of G.L.’s evidence in each of these regards</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[57]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final reason the trial judge gave for disregarding G.L.’s testimony was that it was not inconsistent with M.L.’s.&nbsp; This conclusion, as we have seen, is plainly incompatible with the Crown’s case against the accused, with the record as a whole and, more particularly, with M.L.’s own evidence. In arriving at a different conclusion, Justice Deschamps writes:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">In [the trial judge’s] view, the testimony of the respondent’s wife [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “does not, having regard to the evidence as a whole, interfere with that of the complainant, since it also admits of occasions when she was alone with the accused” . . . .&nbsp; The trial judge also noted that the respondent had not denied being alone with the complainant in the house or in his car when he drove her home at night. [para. 18]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But this was not the Crown’s case against the respondent at trial.&nbsp; Nor is it the Crown’s position in this Court.&nbsp; On the contrary, the Crown insists that <span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">[</span><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%">TRANSLATION</span></a><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%">] </span>“the instances of abuse were numerous and occurred routinely” (transcript, at p. 16) and were not isolated “occasions when she was alone with the accused”, either in the respondent’s home or in his car.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant herself testified that she babysat the children of G.L. and R.P. twice a week during most of the relevant period. Asked whether the abuse <span style="text-transform:uppercase">[</span><span style="font-size:
10.0pt;line-height:200%">TRANSLATION</span><span style="text-transform:uppercase">]</span> “was repeated practically every time”, she replied: “That’s right” (A.R., vol. II-A, at p. 159).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the complainant testified that she was abused by R.P. while babysitting when G.L. was in the hospital giving birth to their second and third children. G.L. testified that the complainant <i>did not babysit on either occasion</i>.&nbsp; The complainant’s evidence was that R.P. again abused her [<span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%">TRANSLATION</span>] “practically every time” she babysat during the five years covered by the indictment.&nbsp; G.L. testified that R.P. was rarely home without her and that, when home, she had an unobstructed view of the scene of the alleged abuse during much of the relevant period.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It thus seems to me unreasonable, if I may say so with respect, to find that G.L.’s testimony does not [<span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%">TRANSLATION</span>] “interfere with” ― or tend to contradict or render implausible ― the evidence of the complainant, M.L.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" align="center" style="text-align:center">IV</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all of these reasons, as stated at the outset, I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal and affirm the respondent’s acquittal by the Court of Appeal.</p>
