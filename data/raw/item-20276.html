 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H attended a house party and was asked to assist with removing another guest who refused to leave despite repeated requests to do so. A physical altercation ensued during which H used a chokehold to restrain the guest, who lost consciousness and died. The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that H caused the guest’s death by placing him in a chokehold. However, based on her assessment of the evidence, she acquitted H of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the requisite subjective <i>mens rea</i>. She also found H not guilty of the lesser included offence of manslaughter, finding that his defence of self‑defence under s.&nbsp;34 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>had an air of reality and that the Crown had failed to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal of the acquittal and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis of the <i>mens rea</i> for murder and the application of self‑defence to manslaughter.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: The appeal should be allowed and the acquittal restored.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Côté, <b>Martin</b>, Kasirer, Jamal, O’Bonsawin and <b>Moreau</b> JJ.: The Crown has a limited right of appeal on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. In the instant case, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the precise errors of law at the root of its intervention and it is not a case in which the appellate court could reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the evidence without calling into question the trial judge’s evaluation of the evidence. Furthermore, even if the alleged errors were ones of law, the trial judge did not commit any such errors. While an inference that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action can be available in some cases, it is not an error of law for a trial judge to reach a different conclusion about a particular accused’s <i>mens rea</i> based on the evidence, and there was no error of law in the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence on the <i>mens rea</i>. As for self‑defence, the trial judge followed the framework set out in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found, and expressed clear conclusions on each element.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown’s ability to appeal an acquittal is circumscribed by s.&nbsp;676(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. This provision provides that a court’s jurisdiction to hear an appeal of an acquittal depends upon there being an error involving a question of law alone. The restricted nature of the Crown’s ability to appeal from an acquittal has deep roots in the principles that underlie the Canadian criminal justice system. The most important justification behind the limited nature of the Crown’s right of appeal lies in the principle against double jeopardy. Expanding the Crown’s right of appeal beyond its proper scope would have a profound impact on the interests of accused persons, especially due to the considerable anxiety created by the prospect of a new trial after a person has been acquitted.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scope of the Crown’s right of appeal of an acquittal depends on what qualifies as a legal question. An appealable error must be traced to a question of law, rather than a question about how to weigh evidence and assess whether it meets the standard of proof. A trial judge’s alleged shortcomings in assessing the evidence may constitute an error of law giving rise to a Crown appeal of an acquittal where the trial judge made a finding of fact for which there is no evidence; there is disagreement with respect to the legal effect of findings of fact or of undisputed facts; an assessment of the evidence is based on a wrong legal principle; and there is a failure to consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence. However, even if the Crown is able to point to an error of law, acquittals are not overturned lightly. The Crown must also convince the appellate court, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the verdict of acquittal would not necessarily have been the same had the error not occurred.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the circumscribed ambit of the Crown’s right of appeal from acquittals and the pressing policy considerations that underpin it, appellate courts should expressly identify the offending errors of law. A failure to precisely identify the error of law risks expanding Crown appeals beyond the scope of s.&nbsp;676. This risk is especially high when the error pertains to an alleged shortcoming in the trial judge’s handling of the evidence. It is not enough to simply assert or state that a trial judge has committed a legal error with respect to their assessment of the evidence. Appellate courts should articulate with precision how the trial judge erred in law.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the instant case, the Court of Appeal did not adequately explain why the error it claimed to have identified was one of law alone for the purposes of s.&nbsp;676(1)(a). The court did not find fault with how the trial judge stated or interpreted the legal standard for the mental element for murder. Rather, it alleged that the error of law was based on how the trial judge assessed the evidence. The Court of Appeal did not state precisely what error of law it thought was committed in relation to the <i>mens rea </i>for murder. The absence of a clearly articulated error of law makes it difficult to conduct effective appellate review and makes it unclear as to whether the alleged error is one of law. In this case, there is no error of law.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no legal rule as to the general dangerousness of chokeholds. Each case must be assessed on its own facts. The dangerousness of a chokehold can vary based on factors such as its nature, force and length. The proposition that a chokehold is always an inherently dangerous act runs the risk of inappropriately injecting an objective element into the <i>mens rea</i> analysis for murder. The subjective foresight required for murder is focused solely on what the accused intended, and the analysis cannot consider what the accused ought to have known about the inherent dangerousness of a chokehold. Thus, when considering the <i>mens rea</i> for murder, a trial judge should not be and cannot be required to assess an accused’s intention against the fact that someone else in their position should have or would have been aware of the danger the chokehold posed. Accordingly, for an accused to be convicted of murder, it is not sufficient for the Crown to prove that a particular accused knew that a chokehold in the circumstances was dangerous or that a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have known that the chokehold would cause bodily harm that was likely to cause death. Neither of these findings would meet the requisite level of subjective intent required for a murder conviction, namely that the accused intended to cause death or that the accused intended to cause bodily harm that they knew was likely to cause death but was reckless as to whether or not death ensued.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the instant case, the trial judge accepted that, at the time, H did not think the chokehold was inherently dangerous and that he also did not have time, in the midst of the altercation, to think about its dangerousness. The trial judge reviewed all the evidence in detail and ultimately concluded that she had a reasonable doubt as to whether H intended to kill the deceased or knew that the chokehold was likely to do so. The trial judge’s conclusion that there was no intent to murder was firmly grounded in the evidence pertaining to H’s subjective state of mind. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge’s assessment that the chokehold used in these circumstances was intended to be a regular calm down method. Such a disagreement as to the characterization of a chokehold in these particular circumstances was not an error of law that justified overturning an acquittal.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An objective approach is applied to the aspects of the self‑defence analysis that measure an accused’s actions against those of a reasonable person in similar circumstances. In the instant case, the trial judge’s reasons make clear that she understood she was to assess whether H’s actions were reasonable in the circumstances and she repeatedly and expressly referred to the appropriate objective standard. The trial judge did not inappropriately focus on what H himself thought at the time of the impugned conduct. The Court of Appeal’s failure to clearly identify which element of the self‑defence inquiry was engaged was problematic as each has its own considerations and methods of evaluation. There were no grounds for concluding that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis or in her application of the law on self‑defence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> <b>Rowe</b> J.: There is agreement with the majority that self‑defence applies and that the acquittal should be restored. However, separate reasons to clarify the Crown’s right to appeal an acquittal are necessary. While the majority emphasizes that the Crown’s right to appeal an acquittal is narrow and limited, there is an exception that warrants note. As “myths” relating to sexual assault have been characterized as errors of law, where the Crown characterizes an aspect of a trial judge’s reasons as incorporating a “myth”, it would meet the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law alone.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par1"><span style="line-height:200%">1</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The appellant, Daniel Hodgson, was acquitted of second degree murder following a trial by judge alone. He attended a house party, and was asked to assist with removing Bradley Winsor, another guest, who refused to leave despite repeated requests to do so. A physical altercation ensued during which Mr. Hodgson used a chokehold to restrain Mr. Winsor, who lost consciousness. Tragically, and despite resuscitation attempts, Mr. Winsor died. The trial judge found that Mr. Hodgson lacked the <i>mens rea</i> for murder and that because he used the chokehold as a means of self-defence to protect himself and others attending the party, he had a defence to the lesser included offence of manslaughter.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par2"><span style="line-height:200%">2</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The Crown appealed, arguing that this was one of the exceptional cases in which the trial judge had committed an error of law that would allow an appellate court to review and reverse an acquittal. The Nunavut Court of Appeal agreed and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis of the <i>mens rea</i> for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par3"><span style="line-height:200%">3</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On further appeal to this Court, after the hearing, we restored Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson’s verdict of acquittal and stated that written reasons would follow. These are those reasons.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par4"><span style="line-height:200%">4</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">First, we explain the foundations of the Crown’s limited right of appeal on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. Second, we address whether the trial judge was required as a matter of law to accept that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action when assessing the <i>mens rea</i> for murder. We conclude that while this inference is available in some cases, it is not an error of law for a trial judge to reach a different conclusion about a particular accused’s <i>mens rea</i> based on the evidence. Third, we explain why there is no legal error in the trial judge’s approach to self-defence. While she did not have the benefit of this Court’s reasoning in <i>R. v. Khill</i>, 2021 SCC 37, her analysis aligns with its principles. She correctly understood what was required under each of the statutory elements in s. 34 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. We are therefore of the view that the trial judge made no errors of law in her reasons. </span></p>

200%">Earlier in the night, Mr. Hodgson and Mantra Ford-Perkins were out celebrating a friend’s birthday. They ran into Crystal Mullin and two others (Margaret Sikkinerk and Samantha Mullin). Crystal Mullin invited all of them to her home. Shawn Burke and his friend, Mr. Winsor, were out on their own and were also invited to Crystal Mullin’s home. All of the house party attendees were socializing and drinking together. Mr. Winsor became increasingly intoxicated throughout the night and had, at some point, also consumed cocaine. At various points throughout the night, Mr. Winsor had behaved inappropriately towards Crystal Mullin. For example, when Crystal Mullin had been heading towards her bedroom, Mr. Winsor was aggressive and tried to get into her room because he wanted to be physically intimate with her. </span></p>

Mr. Burke also repeatedly asked Mr. Winsor to leave </span>Crystal Mullin’s home<span style="line-height:200%">. Mr. Winsor refused to do either. Eventually, a physical altercation broke out between Mr. Burke and Mr. Winsor during which Mr. Winsor pushed Mr. Burke against a wall. </span></p>

Ms. Ford-Perkins woke Mr. Hodgson to ask for his help in dealing with the situation between Mr. Burke and Mr. Winsor. <a name="_Hlk165551379">At the time, Mr. Hodgson was 38 years old, 6 feet tall, weighed 210 pounds and was quite strong. Mr. Winsor was 23 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 304 pounds. Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Winsor had not had any prior relationship, interaction or communication before that night but had spoken to each other during the house party. There were no indications of any “bad blood” between them. </a></span></p>

At the time, Mr. Hodgson’s dominant hand was injured. Mr. Hodgson unsuccessfully tried to pull Mr.&nbsp;Winsor to the ground by pulling on his shoulders from behind. Mr.&nbsp;Winsor responded by elbowing Mr. Hodgson in the head. Mr. Hodgson then put Mr. Winsor in a chokehold. As Mr.&nbsp;Winsor and Mr. Hodgson struggled, the two fell to the floor. </span></p>

They, along with Mr.&nbsp;Burke, shouted at Mr. Hodgson to “stop”. Mr.&nbsp;Burke noticed that Mr. Winsor’s face was turning blue and that Mr. Hodgson was not listening to their calls for him to stop. Mr.&nbsp;Burke then pulled Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Winsor apart. The chokehold incident was over quite quickly, and the eyewitnesses were all surprised that Mr.&nbsp;Winsor did not recover. Samantha Mullin called an ambulance. Ms. Sikkinerk and Mr. Burke performed CPR on Mr.&nbsp;Winsor, but he died from his injuries. </span></p>

It was not disputed that a significant amount of pressure fractured Mr. Winsor’s hyoid bone, bruised the muscles in his neck, and caused internal hemorrhaging. Neck compression can lead to unconsciousness in as little as 10 seconds, but it is not uncommon for someone to become unconscious and survive without permanent injury. While the pathologists saw the neck compression as the primary factor in Mr. Winsor’s death, they disagreed as to the role other factors may have played in causing it. Dr. Chiasson, the defence pathologist, viewed Mr.&nbsp;Winsor’s enlarged heart and the consumption of alcohol and cocaine as contributing factors to his death. The Crown expert, Dr. Milroy, disagreed, although he acknowledged that these factors could make Mr. Winsor less likely to survive the chokehold. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par11"><span style="line-height:200%">11</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The trial judge conducted a thorough review of the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson and each witness and made explicit findings of facts, including conclusions on credibility and reliability. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par12"><span style="line-height:200%">12</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson caused Mr. Winsor’s death by placing Mr. Winsor in a chokehold. However, based on the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence, she acquitted Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the requisite subjective <i>mens rea</i> attaching to this serious crime, that is, proof beyond a reasonable doubt that “Mr. Hodgson intended to kill or intended to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to kill” (trial reasons, at para. 93</span><span style="line-height:200%">, reproduced in A.R., part I, at p. 24</span><span style="line-height:200%">).&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par13"><span style="line-height:200%">13</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The trial judge determined that all requirements for manslaughter, including the mental element, were present as Mr. Hodgson caused Mr. Winsor’s death by the unlawful act of intentionally applying force to Mr. Winsor without his consent. The trial judge next considered Mr. Hodgson’s claim to have acted in self-defence and defence of others under s. 34 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. She concluded that the defence had an air of reality and then went on to consider each of the elements of s. 34 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. She found, with respect to s. 34(1)(a), that Mr. Hodgson believed on reasonable grounds that Mr. Winsor was making a threat of force against the others. In relation to s. 34(1)(b), Mr. Hodgson used the chokehold for the purpose of defending or protecting himself and the others from the threat posed by Mr. Winsor. As to s.&nbsp;34(1)(c), the trial judge considered each of the factors set out in s. 34(2), related each factor to the facts as she found them, and concluded that the Crown had failed to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. While indicating that proportionality was the factor causing the most concern, the trial judge found that Dr. Chiasson’s evidence raised the possibility that the chokehold may have only been fatal because of factors specific to Mr. Winsor, which were not known to Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson. Given her doubt as to whether Mr. Hodgson’s use of a chokehold was disproportionate in the circumstances, the trial judge found Mr. Hodgson not guilty of manslaughter.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the trial judge did not address [the issue of inherent dangerousness] in her reasons for acquittal, either in respect of the intent for murder or manslaughter, but, rather, appeared to accept that a chokehold was a “regular ‘calm down’ method” or a “known calm down move”. While [Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson] admitted he was trying to stop Mr Winsor from struggling, including possibly rendering him unconscious, <u>the trial judge did not assess this evidence with respect to what [Mr. Hodgson] believed or intended considering the dangerousness of squeezing Mr Winsor’s neck to the point of unconsciousness, or the possible recklessness of his actions</u>.

Indeed, “[t]here is a historical aversion to Crown appeals that grounds the differing limitations placed on appellate access as between the Crown and a convicted person” (<i>R. v. Budai</i>,<i> </i>2001 BCCA 349, <span style="line-height:200%">153 B.C.A.C. 98, </span>at para.&nbsp;123, per Ryan&nbsp;J.A.).</p>

Although the provisions that set out the Crown’s right of appeal have evolved over the years, this constraint has remained consistent. For example, when Canada’s <i>Criminal Code </i>was enacted in 1892, “an appeal by the Crown against an acquittal was possible only when a question of law had been reserved for the opinion of the Court of Appeal” or through a leave process which allowed the case to proceed as though the question had been reserved (<i>Morgentaler v. The Queen</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616,<i> </i>at p. 662; see <i>The Criminal Code, 1892</i>, S.C. 1892, c. 29, ss. 743 and 744; see also B. L. Berger, “Criminal Appeals as Jury Control: An Anglo‑Canadian Historical Perspective on the Rise of Criminal Appeals” (2006), 10 <i>Can. Crim. L.R.</i> 1, at p. 36). There were further amendments in 1900<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">[1]</span></sup></span></sup></span></a> and 1909<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">[2]</span></sup></span></sup></span></a>, and the Crown’s right to appeal an acquittal on a question of law was repealed altogether in 1923 (S.C. 1923, c.&nbsp;41, s. 9). It is not clear whether this removal was intentional, but the right was later “restored” in 1930 (<i>Morgentaler</i>, at pp.&nbsp;662‑63; see the explanatory note accompanying s. 38 of House of Commons Bill 138, <i><span style="line-height:200%">An Act to amend the Criminal Code</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, 4th Sess., </span>16th Parl., 1930 (first reading, May 14, 1930)). The amended text of the relevant provision, s. 1013(4) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, granted the Attorney General the right to appeal an acquittal on an indictable offence “on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone” (S.C. 1930, c. 11, s. 28). Unlike previous iterations of the Crown’s ability to appeal from an acquittal, this amendment did not include a requirement of leave by the trial judge or the Court of Appeal (see the discussion of the 1900 and 1909 amendments in <i>Morgentaler</i>, at p.&nbsp;662).</p>

The Crown’s ability to appeal an acquittal has been viewed as an “innovation in the procedure of criminal law” that was a “striking departure from fundamental principles of security for the individual” (<i>Cullen v. The King</i>,<i> </i>[1949] S.C.R. 658, at pp. 665-66, per Rand J., dissenting), having “created an exception to the general rule that no person should be tried twice on the same charge” <span style="line-height:200%">(<i>Guide Book of Policies and Procedures for the Conduct of Criminal Prosecutions in Newfoundland and Labrador</i>, at p. 23-2). Commentators have </span>referred to it as “drastic”, “exceptional”, “special”, “unusual” and “limited” in an “extrem[e]” or “narrow” manner (see, e.g., <i>Wexler v. The King</i>, [1939] S.C.R. 350, at p. 358; <i>Rose v. The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1959] S.C.R. 441, at p. 442; <i>R. v. Podetz</i> (1981),<i> </i>26 A.R. 307 (C.A.), at para.&nbsp;10; <i>R. v.

Indeed, the Crown’s right of appeal from an acquittal is broader in Canada than in most other common law jurisdictions (see <i>R. v.

The United Kingdom imposes significant limitations on the scope of Crown appeals (see <i>Criminal Justice Act 2003</i> (U.K.), 2003, c. 44, ss. 57(4), 63, 67, 76(3), 76(4), 77, 78 and 79; H. Stewart, “Procedural Rights and Factual Accuracy” (2020), 26 <i>Legal Theory</i> 156, at pp. 170-71), and many foreign jurisdictions do not allow appeals from acquittals at all (see S. Coughlan, <i>Criminal Procedure </i>(4th ed. 2020), at p. 587).</p>

As explained in <i>Biniaris</i>,<i> </i>“[e]rror-free trials are desirable as such, but even more so as a safeguard against wrongful convictions” (para. 26). </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par28"><span style="line-height:200%">28</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In the case of jury trials, appellate courts’ respect for a jury acquittal is another reason for limiting the Crown’s right of appeal to questions of law alone (T.&nbsp;Desjardins, <i>L’appel en droit criminel et pénal</i> (2nd ed. 2012), at para. 72). </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par29"><span style="line-height:200%">29</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The most important justification behind the limited nature of the Crown’s right of appeal, however, lies in the principle against double jeopardy. In the United States, it is for this reason that the Supreme Court has concluded that an appeal against an acquittal would violate the Fifth Amendment (see, e.g., <i>McElrath v. Georgia</i>,<i> </i>601 U.S. 87 (2024), at p. 94). The protection against double jeopardy is also part of the framework that governs the Crown’s ability to obtain a retrial after an acquittal in the United Kingdom (<i>Criminal Justice Act 2003</i>,<i> </i>s. 76(4)(c)). </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par30">30</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">This rationale is also crucial in Canadian law. Our Court has held that the Crown’s ability to appeal an acquittal does not violate s. 11(h) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> (<i>R. v. Morgentaler</i>,<i> </i>[1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 155-56, per McIntyre J., dissenting, but not on this point). </span>Nevertheless, as Kasirer J.A. noted in <i>LSJPA – 151</i>, the Crown’s [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “limited right of appeal seeks to prevent an appeal on the facts to protect acquitted persons from the double jeopardy associated with a new trial” (para. 57 (<span style="line-height:200%">footnote omitted)</span>). As explained in <i>Cullen</i>, “[a]t the foundation of criminal law lies the cardinal principle that no [individual] shall be placed in jeopardy twice for the same matter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is the supreme invasion of the rights of an individual to subject [that individual] by<i> </i>the physical power of the community to a test which may mean the loss of [their] liberty or [their] life; and there is a basic repugnance against the repeated exercise of that power on the same facts unless for strong reasons of public policy” (p. 668).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:

Allowing the Crown’s restricted right of appeal to expand beyond its scope would undermine the provision’s protection against wrongful convictions and double jeopardy.</p>

The Court declined the invitation to distinguish between a “question of law alone” and a “question of law”, holding that there is “nothing different” between them and that both terms must receive the same interpretation (para. 31).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par33">33</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the scope of the Crown’s right of appeal of an acquittal depends on what qualifies as a legal question. This assessment will generally turn on the character of the alleged error, rather than on its severity (<i>R. v. George</i>,<i> </i>2017 SCC 38, <span style="line-height:200%">[2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, </span>at para. 17). A legal question generally flows from an accepted or uncontested factual situation; the appellate court can then reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the evidence without calling into question the trial judge’s evaluation of the evidence (M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, <i>Traité général de preuve et de procédure pénales 2023</i> (30th ed. 2023), at para.&nbsp;51.55). Clear examples of legal questions which do not depend on the facts of a given case include, for instance, statutory interpretation, the scope of a constitutional right, and the definition of the essential elements of an offence (para. 51.58).</p>

This is often the case when the alleged error concerns a trial judge’s assessment of the evidence. As this Court explained in <i>R. v. Chung</i>,<i> </i>2020 SCC 8, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 405, “[a]n appealable error must be traced to a question of law, rather than a question about how to weigh evidence and assess whether it meets the standard of proof” (para. 10<span style="line-height:200%"> (citations omitted)</span>). There are, however, situations in which a “trial judge’s alleged shortcomings in assessing the evidence constitute an error of law giving rise to a Crown appeal of an acquittal” (<i>J.M.H.</i>,<i> </i>at para. 24).</p>

Rather, the court alleged that the error of law was based on how the trial judge assessed the evidence regarding the characterization of a chokehold and the weight assigned to its gravity. Specifically, she failed to apply <i>Lemmon</i> and “did not assess this evidence with respect to what [Mr. Hodgson] believed or intended considering the dangerousness of squeezing Mr Winsor’s neck to the point of unconsciousness, or the possible recklessness of his actions” (para. 5).</span></p>

First, we are not convinced that the Court of Appeal articulated an error of law with respect to the trial judge’s handling of the mental element for murder. Second, the Court of Appeal did not adequately <i>explain</i> why the error it claimed to have identified was one of law alone for the purposes of s. 676(1)(a). It acknowledged that Crown appeals are limited to errors of law that have a material bearing on the acquittal and then asserted at para.&nbsp;9: “Having reviewed the evidence and the reasons in this matter, we find [the Crown] has met that burden in this case and appellate intervention is warranted”. However, the Court of Appeal did not state precisely what error of law it thought was committed in relation to the <i>mens rea</i> for murder. <a name="_Hlk169083118">The absence of a clearly articulated error of law makes it difficult to conduct effective appellate review (see <i>R. v.

Courts and counsel must remain vigilant in this regard, because it is sometimes difficult to distinguish questions of law alone from questions of mixed fact and law or from questions of fact. Courts especially must remain vigilant because “[i]t is not usually difficult for an experienced Crown counsel to frame an appeal in language suggesting that a question of law is there involved” when in fact it is not (<i>R. v. Odeon Morton Theatres Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1974] 3 W.W.R. 304 (Man. C.A.), at pp. 304-5; see also <i>R. v.

This risk is especially high when the error pertains to an alleged shortcoming in the trial judge’s handling of the evidence. Such expansion would undermine important principles, including that against double jeopardy. Thus, it is not enough to simply assert or state that a trial judge has committed a legal error with respect to their assessment of the evidence. Appellate courts should articulate with precision how the trial judge erred in law.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par41"><span style="line-height:200%">41</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Beyond invoking two decisions — <i>Lemmon </i>and <i>R. v. Cooper</i>,<i> </i>[1993] 1 S.C.R. 146 — the Court of Appeal did not explain why the error it claims to have identified with respect to the intent for murder is one of law. On this point, it is worth noting that “[t]he determination of the intent or foresight of a person at the time of his participation in a homicide is <u>often a difficult question of fact</u>” (<i>Biniaris</i>,<i> </i>at para. 51 (emphasis added); see also, on intent as a question of fact, </span><i>Schuldt v.

We agree with Mr. Hodgson that, in this case, the determination of criminal intent was a quintessential factual conclusion based on an assessment of the evidence by the trier of fact. As stated in <i>George</i>, at para. 24: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no legal error arises from mere disagreements over factual inferences or the weight of evidence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par42"><span style="line-height:200%">42</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The Crown identified the error of law as the trial judge’s failure to consider the inherent dangerousness of the chokehold used by Mr. Hodgson. The Crown claims the legal errors committed fall within the second, third and fourth categories from <i>J.M.H.</i>, in that the trial judge erred in relation to the legal effect of findings of fact, assessed evidence based on a wrong legal principle or failed to consider all of the evidence in relation to guilt or innocence. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par43">43</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree; the alleged error is not one of law. As this Court explained in <i>Chung</i>, the second and third errors identified in <i>J.M.H. </i>“address errors where the trial judge’s application of the legal principles to the evidence <u>demonstrates an erroneous understanding of the law</u>, either because the trial judge finds all the facts necessary to meet the test but errs in law in its application, or assesses the evidence in a way that <u>otherwise indicates a misapprehension of the law</u>” (<i>Chung</i>,<i> </i>at para. 11 (emphasis added)). It is this “erroneous understanding” or “misapprehension” of <i>the law</i> that an appellate court must precisely identify and articulate when overturning an acquittal. For example, if a court concludes that the trial judge erred in assessing the evidence based on the wrong legal principle, it should explain which principle is at issue, which of its components or aspects is at the root of the error, and how the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate an erroneous understanding or misapprehension of that component or aspect. With respect, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the precise error of law at the root of its intervention. This is not a case in which the appellate court can reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the evidence without calling into question the trial judge’s evaluation of the evidence.</p>

DeSousa</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at p.&nbsp;961; <i>R. v. Creighton</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 44-45). Foreseeability of death is not required. The objective <i>mens rea </i>of manslaughter is not concerned with what the accused intended or knew; rather, “the mental fault lies in failure to direct the mind to a risk which the reasonable person would have appreciated” (<i>Creighton</i>, at p. 58). Thus, a conviction for manslaughter requires that the underlying unlawful act be one that is objectively dangerous (p. 43). The trial judge understood this framework; it is clear from her reasons that she considered the objective dangerousness of a chokehold and that in the absence of self-defence, Mr. Hodgson had the requisite objective mental fault to be found guilty of manslaughter.</span></p>

Murder is distinguished from manslaughter “only by the mental element with respect to the death” (<i>Vaillancourt</i>, at p. 654, quoted in <i>Creighton</i>, at p. 17, per Lamer C.J., concurring). The requisite intent for murder is “an intent to kill or an intent to cause bodily harm that the offender knows is likely to cause death and is reckless as to whether or not death ensues” (<i>R. v.

The law requires subjective foresight of death because the criminal liability for murder is of the highest kind and cannot be justified except where the actor possesses a culpable mental state in respect of that result (<i>Martineau</i>, at p.&nbsp;645, citing <i>R. v. Bernard</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833). Thus, the harsh stigma and punishment associated with murder is reserved for “those who choose to intentionally cause death or who choose to inflict bodily harm that they know is likely to cause death” (<i>Martineau</i>, at p. 646).</span></p>

The accused’s actions are not to be measured against the objective standard of a reasonable person in the same circumstances. The <i>mens rea</i> for murder requires more than an intention to cause bodily harm that the accused knew was dangerous; an accused must have intended to cause bodily harm that they knew was likely to cause death. Thus, the <span style="line-height:200%">proposition that a chokehold is <i>always</i> an inherently dangerous act runs the risk of inappropriately injecting an objective element into the <i>mens rea</i> analysis for murder. This is because the subjective foresight required for murder is focused solely on what the accused intended, and the analysis cannot consider what the accused <i>ought to have known</i> about the inherent dangerousness of a chokehold. <i>&nbsp;</i></span></p>

Accordingly, for an accused to be convicted of murder, it is not sufficient for the Crown to prove that a particular accused knew that a chokehold in the circumstances was dangerous or that a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have known that the chokehold would cause bodily harm that was likely to cause death. Neither of these findings would meet the requisite level of subjective intent required for a murder conviction, namely that the accused intended to cause death or that the accused intended to cause bodily harm that they knew was likely to cause death but was reckless as to whether or not death ensued. </span></p>

Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that, as a method of restraint, chokeholds can certainly carry with them a degree of danger. As Dr. Milroy explained, strangulation prevents breathing and deprives the brain of blood and, thereby, of oxygen. Thus, unlike a headlock — which merely immobilizes someone by limiting their movement — a neck compression chokehold can rapidly lead to unconsciousness. The tragic consequences that Mr. Winsor suffered, including serious injuries in addition to a loss of consciousness and death, speak to how dangerous chokeholds can be.</span></p>

The trial judge accepted that, at the time, Mr. Hodgson did not think the chokehold was inherently dangerous and that he also did not have time, in the midst of the altercation, to think about its dangerousness. His personal experience included viewing videos in the media of law enforcement using chokeholds to induce unconsciousness; he witnessed such a technique used effectively when he was a bouncer in 1998 and had used it himself in 2016. Although the person he had used it on in 2016 was rendered unconscious, that person did not die and instead “got up and started fighting immediately after” (p. 446). While Mr. Hodgson acknowledged seeing news stories of people dying as a result of being placed in chokeholds by police, he testified that he could not “say for sure” whether he knew that chokeholds were dangerous at the time of the party (p. 462).</span></p>

She found that this party “suddenly took an unpleasant turn”; Mr. Hodgson was asked to intervene and “he did what he could” to control Mr. Winsor (para. 94). The trial judge also accepted that Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson’s injured right hand meant “many [other] forms of potential control were likely unavailable” (para. 120). When Mr. Hodgson initially tried to pull Mr. Winsor away from the confrontation, he elbowed Mr. Hodgson in the head, and the trial judge accepted that it did not appear that non-physical means were reducing the threat Mr.&nbsp;Winsor posed at the time. Mr. Hodgson only put Mr. Winsor in a chokehold for a “fairly short period of time”, and everyone at the party was surprised that Mr. Winsor was not responsive afterwards (para. 94).</span></p>

In this case, it was open to the trial judge to make this factual finding. Mr.&nbsp;Burke testified that he had seen the chokehold manoeuvre used on others and believed the chokehold that Mr. Hodgson used was just a regular “calm down” method. One of the experts also testified that the same type of chokehold is regularly used in martial arts. </span></p>

In <i>Lemmon</i>,<i> </i>the accused choked the victim to unconsciousness for the purpose of subduing her and sexually assaulting her. In such a case, the very purpose and intent behind the act of choking was for the accused to overcome the intended victim by rendering her unconscious in order to commit another indictable offence. That there is an inherently dangerous quality to such actions, however, does not mean that trial judges must in every case conclude that every chokehold or action that affects a person’s airways is always an inherently dangerous act.</span></p>

Based on this specific evidence,<i> </i>it was open to the trier of fact to “infer [that] the accused knew that strangulation was likely to result in death” because “breathing is essential to life” (p.&nbsp;159). However, the Court also specifically stressed that “the jury was, of course, <u>not required</u> to make such an inference” (p. 159 (emphasis added)). Accordingly, <i>Cooper</i> should not be read as a blanket legal statement as to the dangerousness of all forms of chokeholds in every scenario.</span></p>

For example, Dr. Milroy explained that certain recreational martial arts forms use chokeholds similar to the one Mr. Hodgson used in order to render a person unconscious or nearly unconscious. Even in that context, however, it is possible for chokeholds to have fatal consequences. In assessing the facts of each case, trial judges must be fully attuned to the potential dangerousness of the chokehold before them. The Court, however, cannot pre-emptively establish a single way of characterizing chokeholds. There is thus no “legal rule” that follows from either <i>Lemmon </i>or <i>Cooper </i>as to the general dangerousness of chokeholds. Rather, each case must be assessed on its own facts. </span></p>

According to <i>R. v.

The common sense inference the Crown proposes is that choking someone forcefully to the point of unconsciousness amounts to an intentional infliction of bodily harm where the natural consequence is death. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[</span><a class="" name="par66"><span style="line-height:200%">66</span></a><span style="line-height:200%">]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">We are of the view that this argument is ill founded.

It is a <i>permissive </i>inference, not a presumptive one (<i>R. v. Seymour</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 252, at para. 20; <i>R. v.

A trier of fact must carefully consider the evidence that points away from the common sense inference before acting on it, as this Court aptly put in <i>Walle</i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">If, however, there is no evidence that could realistically impact on whether the accused had the requisite mental state at the time of the offence, or if the pertinent evidence does not leave the [trier of fact] in a state of reasonable doubt about the accused’s intent, then the [trier of fact] may properly resort to the common sense inference in deciding whether intent has been proved. [para. 67]</p>

The trial judge had the benefit of Mr. Hodgson’s testimony that he did not think the chokehold was dangerous and that he did not intend to kill or harm Mr. Winsor (trial reasons, at para. 88). Having accepted his testimony, this put an end to her <i>mens rea </i>analysis, and there was no need for her to consider the common sense inference. The trial judge is presumed to know the law and need not state reasons for every inference that was or was not drawn (<i>R. v. G.F.</i>, 2021 SCC 20<span style="line-height:200%">, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 74</span>). The absence of an express refusal on the trial judge’s part to engage with the common sense inference cannot constitute an error of law in circumstances where she clearly articulated her findings in relation to the <i>mens rea</i> for murder.</p>

While the critique that a solely subjective approach was taken is clear, it is less clear to which element of the s. 34 analysis this criticism attaches. The Court of Appeal’s holding that the trial judge did not assess Mr. Hodgson’s actions in “considering what a reasonable person would have done in like circumstances” suggests that it was of the view the trial judge erred in her analysis of s. 34(1)(c) (para. 7); however, the phrase the Court of Appeal chose to describe the perceived error — “[Mr. Hodgson’s] response to the perceived threat” (para. 8) — can encompass one, some, or all of the statutory elements of s. 34. The Court of Appeal’s failure to clearly identify which element(s) of the self-defence inquiry under s. 34(1)(a) to (c) was engaged is problematic as each has its own considerations and methods of evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></a></p>

However, the accused’s belief must also be held on reasonable grounds. In order to assess the reasonableness of the accused’s belief, the trier of fact will apply a modified objective standard that takes into account what a reasonable person with the relevant characteristics and experiences of the accused would perceive (<i>Khill</i>, at para. 57). </span><span style="line-height:200%">That the accused’s actual belief must be held “on reasonable grounds” imports an objective component to ensure conformity with community norms and values when weighing the moral blameworthiness of the accused’s actions<i> </i>(<i>Khill</i>,<i> </i>at para. 53). The trial judge applied this modified objective standard and held, based on the evidence she accepted from Crystal Mullin, Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson, Mr. Burke and Ms.&nbsp;Ford-Perkins, that “Mr. Hodgson believed on reasonable grounds that there was a threat of force being made by Mr. Winsor against the others. When Mr. Hodgson went to deal with that threat, as requested by Ms.&nbsp;Ford‑Perkins, force was applied against him by Mr. Winsor” (para. 107). On this element, the trial judge specifically turned her mind to the reasonable grounds component of s.</span>&nbsp;<span style="line-height:200%">34(1)(a) and did not adopt a solely subjective analysis. </span></p>

Indeed, for this second element, a <i>failure</i> to consider the accused’s personal purpose, a subjective inquiry which goes to the root of self-defence, would have been an error of law (<i>Khill</i>, at para. 59). The trial judge expressly found that there was no other reason Mr. Hodgson used the chokehold but to calm Mr. Winsor down and “thereby protect himself and the others at the party from the threat being posed by Mr. Winsor” (para.&nbsp;111). No error has been demonstrated in respect of the trial judge’s treatment of this element. </span></p>

Parliament expressly structured how a decision maker ought to determine whether an act of self-defence was reasonable in the circumstances. What is called for is </span><span style="line-height:200%">an assessment of the overall reasonableness of the accused’s conduct according to the statutory factors. </span><span style="line-height:200%">Reasonableness is measured according to “the relevant circumstances of the person, the other parties and the act” (<i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 34(2); see also <i>Khill</i>, at para. 64). </span><span style="line-height:200%">When a factor is relevant it becomes a mandatory consideration, as s. 34(2) provides that the fact finder “shall” consider all factors set out in paras. (a) to (h) that are relevant in the circumstances of the case (<i>Khill</i>, at para. 68). This objective determination, with its focus </span><span style="line-height:200%">on what a reasonable person would have done in comparable circumstances, strikes the appropriate balance between respecting the security of the person who acts and the security of the person acted upon. It also underscores that the law of self-defence “cannot rest exclusively on the accused’s perception of the need to act” (<i>Khill</i>, </span>at para.&nbsp;2; see also paras. 62 and 65<span style="line-height:200%">).</span></p>

The proposition from <i>Khill </i>cited by the Court of Appeal about not slipping into the mind of the accused was directed towards and addressed the type of reasonableness analysis required under s.&nbsp;34(1)(c). By relying on this quotation, it is likely the Court of Appeal was suggesting that the trial judge had conducted a solely subjective assessment of this element of the section, being the overall reasonableness of Mr. Hodgson’s acts under s.&nbsp;34(1)(c). However, even on that basis, the trial judge’s treatment of this element discloses no such error.</span></a></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:1.4in;text-indent:-42.5pt">(a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The nature of the threat</i>: Mr. Winsor was a large man who could likely harm someone and was not complying with requests to leave the house. He was quite intoxicated, tried to impose himself on Crystal Mullin, and pushed Mr. Burke into the wall. That said, he was likely not posing a threat to someone’s life.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:1.4in;text-indent:-42.5pt">(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force</i>: Mr.&nbsp;Winsor was not complying with requests to leave and elbowed Mr. Hodgson in the head when he tried to intervene. It did not seem to the trial judge that non-physical means were reducing the threat he posed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:1.4in;text-indent:-42.5pt">(c)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The person’s role in the incident</i>: Mr. Hodgson was a strong man who was requested to help remove Mr. Winsor from the home.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:1.4in;text-indent:-42.5pt">(d)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The use or threatened use of a weapon</i>: No weapons were involved.</p>

Mr. Winsor was 23 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 304 pounds. The trial judge did not see a significant difference between them.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:99.25pt;text-indent:-42.55pt">(f) (f.1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The nature, duration and history of any relationship between the parties to the incident and any history of interaction or communication between the parties to the incident</i>: Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Winsor had no relationship, interaction or communication before that night, although they had spoken for a long time during the party. While Mr. Hodgson was uncomfortable with the way Mr.&nbsp;Winsor was talking about Crystal Mullin and treating Mr.&nbsp;Burke, nobody suggested that there was “bad blood” between the two.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:1.4in;text-indent:-42.5pt">(g)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force</i>: A person in a threatening situation need not carefully assess the threat and thoughtfully determine the appropriate response. The situation was a sudden and upsetting one, in which a very heavy man was using violence and ignoring requests to leave. Ms. Ford-Perkins asked Mr. Hodgson to help. Mr. Hodgson observed Mr. Winsor physically resisting attempts to get him to leave. He was not able to pull him away and was hit in his attempt to do so. Given that his dominant hand was injured, many forms of potential control were likely unavailable. In all of the circumstances, a known “calm down” move that could be carried out from behind would have seemed proportional.</p>

This personalization did not transform the analysis into a solely subjective exercise. Indeed, the trial judge’s reasons make clear that she understood she was to assess whether Mr.&nbsp;Hodgson’s actions were reasonable in the circumstances, and she repeatedly and expressly referred to the appropriate objective standard. For example, she stated:</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:58.3pt;line-height:normal">Similarly, if Mr. Hodgson’s evidence were believed, there is some evidence to suggest that <u>his actions were reasonable in the circumstances</u>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" align="center" style="margin-left:58.3pt;text-align:

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:58.3pt;line-height:normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the choke hold applied by Mr. Hodgson <u>was not reasonable in the circumstances</u>?</p>

 <p class="JudgeJuge">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rowe J. —</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par84">84</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am persuaded that self-defence applies and, thus, I agree in the result. I write separately to clarify the Crown’s right to appeal an acquittal. My colleagues deal with this at length, emphasizing how narrowly this is limited. However, there is an exception that warrants note.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par85">85</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At paragraph 34, my colleagues write: “There are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. situations in which a ‘trial judge’s alleged shortcomings in assessing the evidence constitute an error of law giving rise to a Crown appeal of an acquittal’” (quoting <i>R. v. J.M.H.</i>, 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 24). In <i>J.M.H.</i>, the Court identified four such situations, one being an “assessment of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle” (Martin and Moreau JJ.’s reasons, at para.&nbsp;35).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a class="" name="par86">86</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Myths” relating to sexual assault have been characterized as errors of law (<i>R. v. Kruk</i>, 2024 SCC 7). These are not confined to the “twin myths” referred to in s.&nbsp;276 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;C-46. Rather, this is an open category, further myths being identified from time to time. Thus, where the Crown characterizes an aspect of a trial judge’s reasons as incorporating a “myth”, this would meet the requirement in s. 676(1)(a) that the appeal be on a “question of law alone”.</p>
