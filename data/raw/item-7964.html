Because of the erroneous analytical framework applied at trial, the trial judge did not make the necessary findings of fact for an appellate court to find Mr. Katigbak guilty of the offence.&nbsp; Consequently, we would allow Mr. Katigbak’s appeal and order a new trial.</span></p>

Among other things, he stated that the trial judge erred in failing to give effect to the principle that the harm flowing from particular material may be inferred from the nature of the material itself.&nbsp; Blair J.A. also held that the trial judge erred in concluding that the makers of the material did not profit from Mr. Katigbak’s viewing because he did not purchase the material, as “[t]he number of ‘hits’ is important in the world of cyberspace” (para. 82).&nbsp; Similarly, while Mr. Katigbak’s intention not to distribute or replicate the images may have “avoided <i>redoubling </i>the victimization, it did not <i>diminish </i>the re-victimization of the actual children involved through the very process of downloading and possessing the images” (<i>ibid.</i> (emphasis in original)).&nbsp; After reviewing the evidence, he concluded that the risk posed by Mr. Katigbak’s possession was, in all the circumstances, undue.</span></p>

Mr. Katigbak correctly concedes that the trial judge erred in law when she held that, even if the materials themselves had no artistic merit, an artistic motive for possessing the materials sufficed to raise the defence.&nbsp; It is clear from the wording of the provision that Parliament only intended the defence to apply where the materials themselves had artistic merit, and not where the accused simply had an artistic purpose for possessing them.&nbsp; This Court confirmed this interpretation in <i>Sharpe</i>.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC"><span lang="EN-CA">[O]ver time, courts increasingly came to recognize that morals and taste were subjective, arbitrary and unworkable in the criminal context, and that a diverse society could function only with a generous measure of tolerance for minority mores and practices.&nbsp; This led to a legal norm of <u>objectively ascertainable harm</u> instead of subjective disapproval.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 14.]</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">In addition to the requirement of objectively ascertainable harm, the Court in <i>Labaye </i>held that the conduct of the accused must pose a “significant risk of harm” (para. 30) or create a level of harm that is “incompatible with the proper functioning of society” (para. 24).</span></p>

The words “undue risk of harm” set out in s. 163.1(6)(<i>b</i>) should be interpreted to mean a significant risk of objectively ascertainable harm as required by the law of obscenity, rather than the former “moral views of the community” approach.&nbsp; Relying on the moral views of the community would be as unworkable for child pornography offences as it is for obscenity charges.&nbsp; Reasonable people may hold sharply divergent views about the level of risk to young persons that should be tolerated as a result of artistic expression, or scientific research.&nbsp; Instead, the courts must ask whether the harm is objectively ascertainable and whether the level of the harm poses a <i>significant</i> risk to children.&nbsp; It goes without saying that the harm may be either physical, psychological, or both.</span></p>

Mara</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 630, at para. 24).&nbsp; The application of this legal standard to the facts is also a question of law:&nbsp; <i>R. v.

Whether or not the risk to children is “undue” is a question that can only be answered on a case-by-case basis having regard to all of the circumstances.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[74]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In assessing the veracity of Mr. Katigbak’s testimony, the trial judge considered his evidence regarding the connection between the impugned activities and his stated purpose and concluded that his “answers were reasonable given his interests in photography and art” (para. 31).&nbsp; She further noted that his answers were “corroborated by the evidence of Ms Tyrell” and by “the existence of notes and sketches prepared during the time period in question” (<i>ibid.</i>).&nbsp; The trial judge therefore accepted that Mr.&nbsp;Katigbak “collected the images for the purpose that he has described” (para. 32).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[75]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">There is a logical connection between the inquiry into the reasonableness of Mr. Katigbak’s answers in explaining his conduct, and the inquiry into the objective reasonableness of the connection between the impugned actions and the stated purpose. Thus, arguably, had the trial judge conducted the requisite inquiry, she may well have concluded that the objective component of the legitimate purpose branch of the defence was also made out.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the two inquires are different — the first is subjective and the second is objective.&nbsp; Under the subjective component of the defence, the question is whether the accused has a genuine, good faith reason for possessing child pornography for one of the listed grounds.&nbsp; Under the objective component of the defence, the question is whether a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would so conclude.&nbsp; For example, it is well established that the reasonable and probable ground test for assessing the legality of a police officer’s conduct has both a subjective and an objective component (see, e.g., <i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; <i>R. v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265; and <i>R. v. Morelli</i>, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253).&nbsp; By analogy, a court could well consider that the officer’s answers in explaining his conduct were “reasonable” having regard, for example, to his level of experience and conclude on that basis that he genuinely believed that the requisite grounds existed.&nbsp; This conclusion, however, does not answer the question of whether the requisite grounds in fact existed from an objective standpoint.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[76]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The relationship between Mr. Katigbak’s purpose of creating an art exhibition and the protected activity of “art” is obvious and was never in issue.&nbsp; But the connection between the repeated collection and storing of child pornography over a seven-year span and Mr. Katigbak’s stated purpose of creating an art exhibition was highly contentious at trial.&nbsp; In the circumstances, we are not persuaded that the trial judge’s findings of fact on credibility can simply be applied to answer the objective component of the legitimate purpose branch of the defence.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[77]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Given the erroneous legal framework applied at trial, Mr. Katigbak’s acquittal cannot stand.&nbsp; However, because the factual underpinnings in relation to this objective component of the legitimate purpose branch of the defence were not fully explored, the appropriate remedy is to order a new trial.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[78]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In light of our conclusion that there must be a new trial, we do not find it necessary to comment on the trial judge’s findings or her conclusion on the second branch of the defence.&nbsp; We wish to note, however, that the Court of Appeal erred in two respects.&nbsp; First, it erred in its interpretation of the current version of the defence by relying on a community standard of tolerance test to determine if the risk of harm posed was “undue” within the meaning of s. 163.1(6)(<i>b</i>).&nbsp; Blair J.A. stated that “the risk of harm is ‘undue’ in this context when <u>society would find</u> that risk of harm inappropriate, unjustifiable, excessive or unwarranted in the circumstances of the case” (para. 76 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; As discussed above, the correct approach is to assess whether the accused’s activities pose a significant risk of harm to young persons.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The second error of the Court of Appeal was to substitute its own views on the harm posed by Mr. Katigbak for those of the trial judge.&nbsp; Since this was a Crown appeal from acquittal, the Court of Appeal was only permitted to consider errors of law (s. 676(1)(<i>a</i>)).&nbsp; Determining the ways that Mr. Katigbak’s conduct posed a risk of harm to young persons and whether the risk of harm was “undue” will be questions to be determined based on the evidence at the new trial.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In my opinion, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (“CCLA”) raises a valid point in its factum about the interpretation of the concept of undue risk for the purposes of s. 163.1(6)(<i>b</i>)<i>.</i> As it argues, the effect of holding that the generic harms associated with the possession of child pornography amount to undue risk would be to practically eliminate a defence that Parliament decided to leave open to the accused where the purpose of the possession is related to the administration of justice, science, medicine, education or art.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">My colleagues’ interpretation means that even if an accused were to raise a reasonable doubt about his or her purpose at the first stage of the analysis, the defence would inevitably fail. For all practical purposes, at the second stage of the analysis, the presence of the generic harms associated with the possession of child pornography would suffice to establish an undue risk to children.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">It is true that the s. 163.1(6) defence of legitimate purpose is common to all the child pornography offences listed in s. 163.1, including those of making and distributing of such material. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the social interests at stake are the same and that the importance of the public interest is identical in respect of all these offences. Indeed, Parliament has not attached the same penalties to them. The nature and scope of the defence must be consistent with the nature of the crime itself. The making and the distribution of child pornography entail a higher risk to the public and to children. The harms inherent in such offences are necessarily more serious and they always imply a relationship with third parties, that is, parties other than the victims themselves. This factor may restrict the ambit of the defence of legitimate purpose in such cases. Although I would not downplay the seriousness of the offence of possession of child pornography given that the activities of making and distribution often flow from or result in possession, it is not of equal seriousness or consequence.&nbsp; Possession does not have the same impact on others as the making or distribution of child pornography. After all, it is an offence that may, like that of accessing child pornography, be committed in private, in one’s home, without any contact with others (s.&nbsp;163.1(4.1)).</span></p>

A court must find facts and circumstances that create an undue risk in the context of the case before it, such as a lack of security and ease of access to the material by others. Otherwise, although my colleagues argue that the defence could still be made out in some cases, I wonder how and when. From a practical standpoint, their interpretation forecloses that possibility.</span></p>
