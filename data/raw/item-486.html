letter-spacing:-.15pt"> R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 15, 1985, the counsel of record (and counsel at the first trial), Mr. Shore, brought an application to be removed from the record.&nbsp; The appellant apparently preferred to be represented by Mr. Greenspan who had conducted his successful appeal.&nbsp; The request was denied at that time due to a concern by the court that new counsel would not be available or would be unable to prepare by the January trial date.&nbsp; However, on a further motion on December 5, 1985, Mr. Shore was removed from the record.&nbsp; Predictably, on January 7, 1986, the appellant appeared without counsel and Osborne J. understandably declined to conduct the trial.&nbsp; The appellant provided the court with a list of eleven criminal lawyers who had stated they were unable to take the case.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Court must be very sensitive to an accused's right to choose counsel of choice.&nbsp; However, that right must be exercised with reasonable diligence&nbsp; (see</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> R. v. Ross</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3).&nbsp; Normally, an attempt to secure the services of eleven different lawyers would demonstrate that the appellant had made a reasonable effort to secure representation.&nbsp; However, in this case, I am of the opinion that the appellant must answer for the delay caused by his lack of counsel.&nbsp; I reach this conclusion because the first application to remove Mr. Shore from the record came only a month and a half prior to the trial date.&nbsp; This date had been known to the appellant since June.&nbsp; Section 11(</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">b</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">) must only protect those who demonstrate reasonable diligence in their selection of counsel when it affects the timing of the proceedings.&nbsp; Not all delays or adjournments sought by an accused will comprise a waiver as the underlying cause may be due to circumstances beyond the control of the accused.&nbsp; Here, however, the appellant must be held accountable for this delay.&nbsp; The trial was rescheduled for April 21, 1986.&nbsp; Because I attribute this delay to the appellant, this three and one-half month delay is satisfactorily explained by the Crown.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth and longest period extends from the conclusion of the second trial until the scheduled start of the third, a period of close to eighteen months.&nbsp; The Crown again argues that the appellant's actions were responsible for much of this delay such that he should be held to have waived his s.&nbsp;11(</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">b</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">) rights.&nbsp; I am of the opinion, however, that most of this period has not been satisfactorily explained as being either within the inherent time requirements of the case or attributable to the accused.&nbsp; The Crown's conduct of the proceedings must now be scrutinized in light of the fact that through no fault of the appellant he had been tried twice and was still in jeopardy.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A month after the end of the second trial, the appellant appeared unrepresented in Assignment Court.&nbsp; The matter was adjourned two weeks until June 16 to allow him to appear with counsel.&nbsp; Mr. Greenspan, counsel at the second trial, had informed the appellant that he could not conduct the third trial if it were again held in Ottawa.&nbsp; The appellant was also suffering financial difficulties and had been seeking Legal Aid for some time prior to the June 16 appearance.&nbsp; However, no Legal Aid was forthcoming by the time of that appearance at which the unrepresented appellant was given a trial date of September 22, 1986.&nbsp; Legal Aid was only obtained upon appeal in July.&nbsp; This difficulty in obtaining Legal Aid was not the fault of the appellant and therefore he cannot be held responsible for any delay as a result.&nbsp; This is a different form of systemic delay which cannot be relied on here by the Crown as justification for any delay.&nbsp; I agree with counsel for the appellant that in view of what has occurred, the Crown had some responsibility to assist the accused in obtaining Legal Aid or indeed in funding the defense.&nbsp; The latter is, according to counsel, not an uncommon occurrence.&nbsp; While the Crown contends that its current practice concerning assistance extends only to appellate proceedings, there is no reason why in special circumstances it should not apply to trial proceedings which have been protracted due to appeals.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Criminal Code</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 473(1)), but opposed it and argues that this delay is solely the responsibility of the appellant.&nbsp; Admittedly, the Crown had little control over the delay once it refused to allow a hearing before a judge alone.&nbsp; In view of the circumstances, however, and recognizing that refusal to consent is the prerogative of the Crown, I cannot accept the Crown's explanation of this delay.&nbsp; The antecedent delay was now chronic.&nbsp; The time for insisting on dubious procedural advantages had gone.&nbsp; This request by the appellant to be tried by judge alone was especially reasonable given his earlier experiences with jury trials.&nbsp; The appellant also demonstrated his sincerity in wanting to conclude the proceedings by offering to plead guilty to manslaughter.</span></p>
