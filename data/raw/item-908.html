Khan</i> should be understood as the triumph of a principled analysis over a set of ossified judicially created categories.&nbsp; It signalled a departure from a view of hearsay characterized by a general prohibition on the reception of such evidence, subject to a limited number of defined exceptions, and a movement toward an approach governed by the principles which underlie the rule and its exceptions alike.&nbsp; Hearsay evidence of statements made by persons who are not available to give evidence at trial ought generally to be admissible, where the circumstances under which the statements were made satisfy the criteria of necessity and reliability set out in <i>Khan</i>, and subject to the residual discretion of the trial judge to exclude the evidence when its probative value is slight and undue prejudice might result to the accused.&nbsp; Here, the hearsay evidence of what the deceased told her mother in the first two telephone calls satisfied the criteria of necessity and reliability, and was properly admissible on that basis.&nbsp; While the contents of the third call satisfied the criterion of necessity as well, the events surrounding the making of that call do not provide that circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness that would justify their admission without the possibility of crossâexamination.&nbsp; This evidence was thus not admissible.&nbsp; The evidence of the other woman who had gone to Canada with the accused was also inadmissible because it was evidence going to character and was not relevant to the murder charge.&nbsp; It was admitted, however, and its effect on the jury may have been highly prejudicial.&nbsp; The trial judge's caution to the jury was inadequate to remove this possibility of prejudice.&nbsp; The order for a new trial must accordingly be affirmed.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeal proceeded from the premise that, as hearsay, all this evidence was inadmissible unless it fell within some recognized exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; Referring to <i>Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon</i>, 145 U.S. 285 (1892), and <i>R. v. Moore</i> (1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d) 541 (Ont. C.A.), the Court of Appeal concluded that there did exist an exception to the hearsay rule where the declarant's statements were adduced to indicate the intention, or state of mind, of the declarant at the time the statements were made.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

P. (R.)</i> (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (Ont. H.C.), the Court of Appeal noted that while hearsay evidence was potentially admissible to prove the state of mind of the declarant when the statements were made, such evidence was not admissible to prove the intentions or state of mind of persons other than the declarant, or that such persons acted in accordance with the declarant's expectations, or, indeed, to prove the truth of the factual assertions contained in the declarant's statements of intention.&nbsp; Consequently, the Court of Appeal concluded that the hearsay evidence relating to the first two telephone calls (Larry has left me; I need a ride home) was admissible, but only to show Ms. King's state of mind at the time she telephoned her mother, i.e., that she wanted to come home.&nbsp; This evidence was not admissible, however, to prove the factual assertion that the respondent had abandoned her.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal concluded, further, that the hearsay evidence of the third telephone call (Larry has come back) was not admissible for any purpose at all, and could not be introduced to prove that the respondent later returned and picked up Ms. King.</span></p>

Public Prosecutor</i>, [1956] 1 W.L.R. 965 (P.C.), at p. 970, is helpful to establish the parameters of the debate:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Evidence of a statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness may or may not be hearsay.&nbsp; It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement.&nbsp; It is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made.&nbsp; The fact that the statement was made, quite apart from its truth, is frequently relevant in considering the mental state and conduct thereafter of the witness or of some other person in whose presence the statement was made.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This statement of the "hearsay rule" is a useful illustration of the circumstances in which statements made by persons who are not called as witnesses have traditionally been considered inadmissible.&nbsp; When such statements are introduced to prove the truth of their contents, they have generally been considered to be inadmissible.&nbsp; However, when introduced simply to prove that they were made, they have traditionally been regarded as admissible, either under an "exception" to the hearsay rule, or more correctly from an analytical point of view because they fall outside the definition of hearsay.&nbsp; What is important is that the evidentiary dangers traditionally associated with statements by persons not called as witnesses -- principally, the unavailability of the declarant for cross-examination -- are not present, or are present to a far less significant degree, when the relevance of such statements lies simply in the fact that they were made.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, therefore, on the traditional view of hearsay, the statements made by Ms. King to her mother on the night of her death -- (1) "Larry has gone away"; (2) "Larry has not come back and I need a ride home"; (3) "Larry has come back and I no longer need a ride"; and (4) "I am on my way" -- are hearsay, and inadmissible, if introduced to prove the truth of the assertions they contain.&nbsp; However, as noted above, such statements are not hearsay if they are adduced simply to prove that they were made.&nbsp; The fact that the statement was made, however, would in itself have to be relevant for the statement to be received on this ground.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One exception to the hearsay rule arises when the declarant's statement is adduced in order to demonstrate the intentions, or state of mind, of the declarant at the time when the statement was made.&nbsp; The "current intentions" exception to the hearsay rule was set out by the Supreme Court of the United States in <i>Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; In that case, the appellant insurance company resisted payment under a policy on the life of the respondent's husband, arguing that there had been a conspiracy to fake the death of the husband, and that the body discovered was actually that of a third person.&nbsp; This third person had written a letter to his family, in which he indicated his intention to go travelling with the respondent's husband.&nbsp; The letter could not be located, but a witness was prepared to testify as to its contents.&nbsp; The issue, therefore, was whether the evidence of the contents of the letter could be received in evidence.&nbsp; Writing for the court, Gray J. decided that testimony as to the contents of the letter, while technically hearsay, was admissible both to prove the intention of the third person to go travelling with the respondent's husband, and to support the inference that he had acted on this intention.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would appear that at least the "state of mind" exception to the hearsay rule has been accepted in the English common law of evidence.&nbsp; The position seems to be that where the intentions or state of mind of the declarant are relevant to a fact in issue, hearsay evidence is admissible, and, indeed, may be the best evidence to prove this.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Blastland</i>, [1986] A.C. 41 (H.L.), Lord Bridge of Harwick said, at p. 54, that:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Kearley</i>, [1992] 2 All E.R. 345 (H.L.).</span></p>

Wysochan</i> (1930), 54 C.C.C. 172 (Sask. C.A.): statements made by a dying person found admissible to prove how the death occurred; <i>Home v. Corbeil</i>, [1955] 4 D.L.R. 750 (Ont. H.C.): statements made by an estranged husband found relevant to his intention to resume cohabitation with his wife, and therefore to his wife's pecuniary interest in his continuing life.&nbsp; Most recently, in <i>R. v. P. (R.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, Doherty J. summarized the case law and outlined the scope of the exception, and its limitations, at pp. 343-44, when he said:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, however, is not fatal to the appellant's case.&nbsp; This Court has not taken the position that the hearsay rule precludes the reception of hearsay evidence unless it falls within established categories of exceptions, such as "present intentions" or "state of mind."&nbsp; Indeed, in our recent decision in <i>R. v. Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, we indicated that the categorical approach to exceptions to the hearsay rule has the potential to undermine, rather than further, the policy of avoiding the frailties of certain types of evidence which the hearsay rule was originally fashioned to avoid.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has long been recognized that the principles which underlie the hearsay rule are the same as those that underlie the exceptions to it.&nbsp; Indeed, <i>Wigmore on Evidence</i> (2nd ed. 1923), vol. III, described the rule and its exceptions at Â§1420 in the following terms:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Of the criterion of necessity, Wigmore stated:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">And of the companion principle of reliability -- the circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness -- the following:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Clearly the categories of necessity are not closed.&nbsp; In <i>Khan</i>, for instance, this Court recognized the necessity of receiving hearsay evidence of a child's statements when the child was not herself a competent witness.&nbsp; We also suggested that such hearsay evidence might become necessary when the emotional trauma that would result to the child if forced to give <i>viva voce</i> testimony would be great.&nbsp; Whether a necessity of this kind arises, however, is a question of law for determination by the trial judge.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Pratte J. then proceeded, at p. 734, to apply this principle to the case before him:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question to be resolved in the case at bar is whether the fact that the accused uses marijuana creates a logical inference that he knew or ought to have known that the dresser contained a narcotic at the time it was imported.&nbsp; To me there is no connection or nexus between either of these two facts.&nbsp; The use of marijuana by the accused certainly established that he knew of this narcotic, that he was in a position to identify it, but it had no probative value in relation to the guilty knowledge which must be proven by the prosecution.&nbsp; The evidence that the prosecution sought to introduce can have only one effect: that of raising suspicions against the accused solely for the reason that a marijuana user is more likely to import the substance illegally than someone who does not use the narcotic.&nbsp; In my view, this is precisely the type of evidence which cannot be admitted.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would respectfully adopt the reasoning of the majority in <i>Cloutier</i> as applicable in the present case.&nbsp; The evidence of the respondent's past activities involving illegal drugs could only have had one effect: that of raising suspicions against him solely for the reason that a person who is involved in smuggling drugs is more likely to commit murder than a person who has not engaged in that activity.&nbsp; In my view, there was no sufficient nexus between the respondent's alleged drug smuggling activities and the ultimate issue at his trial: whether he murdered Aritha King.&nbsp; Consequently, this evidence ought not to have been admitted.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the evidence of Hope Denard was admitted, and its effect on the jury may have been highly prejudicial.&nbsp; In my opinion, moreover, the trial judge's caution to the jury was inadequate to remove this possibility of prejudice.&nbsp; Indeed, this prejudice could not have been eliminated except by an instruction to the jury that they must ignore the Crown's theory in respect of the evidence of Hope Denard altogether.&nbsp; The learned trial judge did not go this far.</span></p>
