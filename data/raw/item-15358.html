The Crown opposed the interim release of S. The justice of the peace who heard the initial application for release found that detention was necessary on the basis of s. 515(10)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i>, that is, because the interim detention of S was necessary for the protection or safety of the public, and to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. The justice who heard the second application for release on completion of the preliminary inquiry found that the detention of S was still justified under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>).

It is not a residual ground for detention that applies only where the first two grounds for detention provided for in s. 515(10)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are not satisfied. The scope of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) has been unduly restricted by the courts in some cases; this provision <span style="line-height:200%">must not be interpreted narrowly or applied sparingly</span>. The application of this ground for detention is not limited to exceptional circumstances, to unexplainable crimes, to the most heinous of crimes or to certain classes of crimes. The fact that detention may be justified only in rare cases is but a consequence of the application of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>), and not a precondition to its application, a criterion a court must consider in its analysis or the purpose of the provision. Section 515(10)(<i>c</i>) is worded clearly, and it does not require exceptional or rare circumstances. Nor is the question whether a crime is unexplainable or unexplained a criterion that should guide justices in their analysis under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>). This concept is ambiguous and confusing. Because <span style="line-height:200%">many crimes may be explainable in one way or another, the unexplainable crime criterion is of little assistance</span>. The application of a criterion based on the notion of an unexplainable crime could also lead to undesirable conclusions, since crimes that are heinous and horrific might not satisfy it. Such a criterion could give the public the impression that justices are justifying certain crimes, that is, crimes that are explainable.</p>

First of all, the justice must determine the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case. The prosecutor is not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence, and the justice must be careful not to play the role of trial judge or jury: matters such as the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of scientific evidence must be analyzed at trial, not at the release hearing. The justice must nevertheless consider the quality of the evidence tendered by the prosecutor in order to determine the weight to be given to this circumstance in his or her balancing exercise. The justice must also consider any defence raised by the accused. If there appears to be some basis for the defence, the justice must take this into account in analyzing the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the justice must determine the objective gravity of the offence in comparison with the other offences in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. This is assessed on the basis of the maximum sentence — and the minimum sentence, if any — provided for in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank"> <span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> for the offence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The justice must then consider the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, including whether a firearm was used. Those that might be relevant under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) include the following: the fact that the offence is a violent, heinous or hateful one, that it was committed in a context involving domestic violence, a criminal gang or a terrorist organization, or that the victim was a vulnerable person. If the offence was committed by several people, the extent to which the accused participated in it may be relevant. The aggravating or mitigating factors that are considered by courts for sentencing purposes can also be taken into account.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the fourth circumstance to consider is the fact that the accused is liable for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment. Although it is not desirable to establish a strict rule regarding the number of years that constitutes a lengthy term of imprisonment, some guidance is required. Because no crime is exempt from the possible application of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>), the words “lengthy term of imprisonment” do not refer only to a life sentence. Moreover, to determine whether the accused is actually liable for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment, the justice must consider all the circumstances of the case known at the time of the hearing, as well as the principles for tailoring the applicable sentence. This fourth circumstance is assessed subjectively.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstances listed in s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) are not exhaustive. The court must consider all the circumstances of each case, paying particular attention to the four listed circumstances. <span style="line-height:200%">No single circumstance is determinative: the justice must consider the combined effect of all the circumstances of each case to determine whether detention is justified</span>. This involves balancing all the relevant circumstances. At the end of this balancing exercise, the ultimate question to be asked by the court is whether detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. Thus, the court must not order detention automatically even where the four listed circumstances support such a result. Some other circumstances that might be relevant are the personal circumstances of the accused (age, criminal record, physical or mental condition, and membership in a criminal organization), the status of the victim and the impact on society of a crime committed against that person, and the fact that the trial of the accused will be held at a much later date.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;

The person in question is a thoughtful person, not one who is prone to emotional reactions, whose knowledge of the circumstances of the case is inaccurate or who disagrees with our society’s fundamental values. However, this person is not a legal expert, and, although he or she is aware of the importance of the presumption of innocence and the right to liberty in our society, expects that someone charged with a crime will be tried within a reasonable period of time, and knows that a criminal offence requires proof of culpable intent and that the purpose of certain defences is to show the absence of such intent, the person is not able to appreciate the subtleties of the various defences that are available to the accused. This reasonable person’s confidence in the administration of justice may be undermined not only if a court declines to order detention where detention is justified having regard to the circumstances of the case, but also if it orders detention where detention is not justified.</p>

They establish not a <i>de novo</i> proceeding, but a hybrid remedy. The judge must determine whether it is appropriate to exercise his or her power of review. Exercising this power will be appropriate in only three situations: (1) where there is admissible new evidence<span style="line-height:200%"> </span>if that evidence shows a material and relevant change in the circumstances of the case; (2) where the impugned decision contains an error of law; or (3) where the decision is clearly inappropriate.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, are relevant to the determination of what constitutes new evidence for the purposes of the review provided for in ss. 520 and 521. Given the generally expeditious nature of the interim release process and the risks of violating the rights of the accused, and since the release hearing takes place at the very start of criminal proceedings and not at the end like the sentence appeal, a reviewing judge must be flexible in applying these four criteria. Regarding the first criterion, due diligence, the reviewing judge may consider evidence that is truly new or evidence that existed at the time of the initial release hearing but was not tendered for some reason that is legitimate and reasonable. Such new evidence is not limited to evidence that was unavailable to the accused before the initial hearing<span style="line-height:200%">. In each case, the reviewing judge will have to determine whether the reason why the accused did not tender such pre-existing evidence earlier was legitimate and reasonable</span>. As to the second criterion, it will suffice that the evidence be relevant for the purposes of s. 515(10). This criterion will therefore rarely be decisive in the context of an application for review under ss. 520 and 521, since the range of relevant evidence will generally be quite broad. The third criterion — that the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief — must be interpreted in light of the relaxation of the rules of evidence at the bail stage and in particular of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec518subsec1" target="_blank">s. 518(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>e</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which provides that “the justice may receive and base his decision on evidence considered credible or trustworthy by him in the circumstances of each case”. Finally, the fourth <i>Palmer</i> criterion should be modified as follows: the new evidence must be such that it is reasonable to think, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that it could have affected the balancing exercise engaged in by the justice under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>). The new evidence must therefore be significant. If the new evidence meets the four criteria for admissibility, the reviewing judge is authorized to repeat the analysis under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) as if he or she were the initial decision-maker.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will also be appropriate to intervene if the justice has erred in law or if the impugned decision was clearly inappropriate, that is, if the justice who rendered it gave excessive weight to one relevant factor or insufficient weight to another. The reviewing judge therefore does not have the power to interfere with the initial decision simply because he or she would have weighed the relevant factors differently.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the Superior Court judge intervened even though there was no basis for a review, given that there was no change in circumstances and no error of law, and that the initial decision was not clearly inappropriate. When all the relevant circumstances are weighed as required by s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>), the detention of S was necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[1]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The repute of our criminal justice system rests on the deeply held belief of Canadians that the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence are fundamental values of our society that require protection. However, that repute also depends on the confidence citizens have that persons charged with serious crimes will not be able to evade justice, harm others or interfere with the administration of justice while awaiting trial. The risk that one of these events might tarnish the repute of the justice system was recognized by Parliament in enacting <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec515subsec10" target="_blank">s. 515(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">,<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank"> <span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> (“<i>Cr. C.</i>”), under which the interim detention of an accused may be ordered where that is necessary to ensure the attendance of the accused in court or to guarantee the protection or safety of the public. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Moreover, Parliament judged that there are circumstances in which releasing an accused person could undermine the repute of the justice system, and this led it to provide, in s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i>, for a third ground for interim detention, maintaining confidence in the administration of justice. Thus, Parliament recognized that there are circumstances in which allowing a person charged with a serious crime to be released into the community pending trial in the face of overwhelming evidence might suggest to the public that justice has not been done: see <i>R. v. Hall</i>, 2002 SCC 64, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 26. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">This appeal affords the Court an opportunity to consider the circumstances in which pre-trial detention of an accused is necessary in order to maintain the confidence of the Canadian public in the administration of justice in accordance with s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>This provision has already been considered by the Court in <i>Hall</i>, but the central issue in that case was the constitutionality of this ground for detention as it was worded at that time. In cases decided by lower courts since <i>Hall</i>, the provision has been given widely varying interpretations, making it necessary for the Court to provide further guidance on its application.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The ground for detention in s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> requires that an effort be made to strike an “appropriate balance between the rights of the accused and the need to maintain justice in the community”</span><span style="line-height:200%">: <i>Hall</i>, at para. 41. In addition, judges must adopt the perspective of the public in determining whether detention is necessary. What the word “public” means is not always easy to understand. These difficulties no doubt explain why s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> has generated so much discussion among legal experts and led to inconsistent results across the country. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the scope of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> has been unduly restricted by the courts in some cases. This ground for detention is not necessarily limited to exceptional circumstances, to the most heinous of crimes involving circumstances similar to those in <i>Hall</i>, or to certain classes of crimes. The interpretation of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> has also been truncated by a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word “<i>public</i>” used in the provision’s French version (and implied in the word “confidence” used in the English version), which I will discuss below. For now, I will simply note that the “public” are reasonable, well-informed members of the community, but not legal experts with in-depth knowledge of our criminal justice system.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">This appeal is the first time this Court has been called upon to determine the extent of the power provided for in ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> to review decisions with respect to detention or to interim release. Since a decision whether to order the pre-trial release of an accused involves a delicate balancing of all the relevant circumstances, the power of a judge hearing an application under s. 520 or 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> to review such a decision is not open-ended. I conclude that exercising this power will be appropriate in only three situations: (1) where there is admissible new evidence; (2) where the impugned decision contains an error of law; or (3) where the decision is clearly inappropriate. In the last of these situations, a reviewing judge cannot simply substitute his or her assessment of the evidence for that of the justice who rendered the impugned decision. It is only if the justice gave excessive weight to one relevant factor or insufficient weight to another that the reviewing judge can intervene.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In the case at bar, the respondent, Jeffrey St-Cloud, was charged with aggravated assault under s. 268 <i>Cr. C. </i>The justice of the peace who heard the initial application for release found that detention was necessary on the basis of s. 515(10)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>The justice who heard the respondent’s second application for release on completion of the preliminary inquiry found that his detention was still justified under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>). The respondent then applied under s. 520 <i>Cr. C.</i> for a review by a Superior Court judge, who determined that detention was not necessary under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) and ordered the respondent’s release. The Crown is appealing that decision to this Court. </span></p>

The detention of the respondent is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. I will explain why. </span></p>

The incident was recorded by the video system on the bus, and the recording showed that the respondent had been an active participant in the assault.

However, it was known that he had, at the very least, a hairline fracture to a facial bone and a concussion.</span></p>

He also considered the fourth circumstance, namely the fact that the respondent was liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment (maximum sentence of 14 years). As well, he was of the opinion that aggravating factors were evident from the circumstances of the case. </span></p>

The public means persons who are reasonable, dispassionate and properly informed about the values expressed in legislation, including the presumption of innocence, which applies throughout the criminal process, as I have said, but who are also informed about all the circumstances associated with the commission of a crime.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the videotape and all the circumstances, the defendant’s participation, the likelihood of a conviction and the chances of a significant term of imprisonment, the Court is satisfied that such a reasonable person would conclude that interim release must be denied.

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1869, the Federal Government enacted legislation making bail discretionary for all offences: see <i>An Act respecting the duties of Justices of the Peace, out of Sessions, in relation to persons charged with Indictable Offences</i>, S.C. 1869, c. 30. Bail was therefore left to the discretion of the judge. Although the primary determinant for denying bail was the need to compel the accused’s attendance, courts also considered other factors such as the nature of the offence, the severity of the penalty, the evidence against the accused, and the character of the accused: see, for example, <i>R. v. Gottfriedson</i> (1906), 10 C.C.C. 239 (B.C. Co. Ct.); <i>Re N.</i> (1945), 87 C.C.C. 377 (P.E.I.S.C.).</p>

The Act iden­tified two branches for refusing bail: (1) where the accused’s detention was necessary to ensure his attendance in Court; or (2) where detention was “necessary in the public interest or for the protec­tion or safety of the public” against the accused re-offending or interfering with the administration of justice. The use of “or” in the second branch led to the view that there were in effect three grounds for denying bail: (1) ensuring appearance at trial; (2) protection against criminal offences pending trial; and (3) the “public interest”. These grounds were originally enacted as <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec457subsec7" target="_blank">s. 457(7)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, and later became s. 515(10)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</p>

Section 11(<i>e</i>) has two distinct components: (1) the right to “reasonable bail” in terms of quantum of any monetary component and any other conditions that might be imposed; and (2) the right not to be denied bail without “just cause”. </span></p>

C.</i> that authorized pre-trial detention on the ground that detaining the accused was necessary in the “public interest”. The Court held that this wording was vague and imprecise and that it authorized a “standardless sweep” allowing a “court [to] order imprisonment whenever it [saw] fit”: p. 732.</span></p>

(<i>c</i>) to it: <i>Criminal Law Improvement Act, 1996</i>, S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 59(2). The detention of an accused could then be justified “on <u>any other just cause</u> being shown and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, where the detention is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice”. At the time, Parliament had not drawn up a list of circumstances the justice was required to consider in this analysis. </span></p>

According to the Chief Justice, “[w]here justice is not seen to be done by the public, confidence in the bail system and, more generally, the entire justice system may falter”: para. 26. Yet, she wrote, “[p]ublic confidence is essential to the proper functioning of the bail system and the justice system as a whole”: para. 27, citing <i>Valente v.

It represents a <u>separate and distinct basis for bail denial</u> not covered by the other two categories. <u>The same facts may be relevant to all three heads.</u>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

C.</i> applies.<i> </i>However, I will reproduce the following remarks:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Section 515(10)(<i>c</i>) sets out specific factors which delineate a narrow set of circumstances</u> under which bail can be denied on the basis of maintaining confidence in the administration of justice. As discussed earlier, situations may arise where, despite the fact the accused is not likely to abscond or commit further crimes while awaiting trial, his presence in the community will call into question the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. Whether such a situation has arisen <u>is judged by all the circumstances, but in particular the four factors</u> that Parliament has <u>set out</u> in s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) — the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding its commission and the potential for lengthy imprisonment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:58.4pt;text-indent:-58.4pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>This, then, is Parliament’s purpose: to maintain public confidence</u> in the bail system and the justice system as a whole.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Most importantly, <u>the judge makes this appraisal objectively</u> through the lens of the four factors Parliament has specified. The judge cannot conjure up his own reasons for denying bail; <u>while the judge must look at all the circumstances, he must focus particularly on the factors Parliament has specified</u>. At the end of the day, the judge can only deny bail if satisfied that in view of these factors and related circumstances, a reasonable member of the community would be satisfied that denial is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [T]he provision does not authorize a “standardless sweep” nor confer open-ended judicial discretion. Rather, <u>it strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of the accused and the need to maintain justice in the community</u>. In sum, it is not overbroad. [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The appellant submits that, despite the very clear principles enunciated in <i>Hall</i>, the courts have artificially added factors to s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> for the avowed purpose of restricting its scope and limiting the cases in which its application is justified. The appellant asserts that such an approach must be rejected.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The respondent counters that it follows from the principles established in <i>Hall</i> that the cases in which s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) applies will be few and far between. The respondent submits that the four factors must be assigned a relative weight and that the justice must not lose sight of the key question, namely whether confidence in the administration of justice would be maintained if the accused were released.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">It is true that some decisions reflect a strict application of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>): see, e.g., <i>R. v. Thomson</i> (2004), 21 C.R. (6th) 209 (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v. B. (A.)</i> (2006), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v. Pichler</i>, 2009 ABPC 24; <i>R. v. Teemotee</i>, 2011 NUCJ 17. This approach has also been adopted by some appellate courts. For example, the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Ontario Court of Appeal have stated that the use of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) is justified only in rare or exceptional circumstances: <i>R. v. Bhullar</i>, 2005 BCCA 409, at paras. 62 and 65; <i>R. v. Brotherston</i>, 2009 BCCA 431, 71 C.R. (6th) 81, at paras. 30 and 35; <i>R. v. LaFramboise </i>(2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 492 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 30. A variant of this prerequisite is that s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) must be used “sparingly”: <i>LaFramboise</i>,<i> </i>at para. 30;<i> </i><i>R</i>. <i>v.</i> <i>D. (R.)</i>, 2010 ONCA 899, 273 C.C.C. (3d) 7, at paras. 51-53. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has also held that s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) requires that there be “something more”, something in addition to the four factors set out in it: <i>R. v. Blind</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 87, at para. 16. Although the latter case predated this Court’s decision in <i>Hall</i>, this statement has been reiterated since <i>Hall</i>, including by the Ontario Court of Appeal: <i>LaFramboise</i>,<i> </i>at para. 38. In a judgment subsequent to <i>LaFramboise</i>, the Ontario Court of Appeal found instead that the words “something more” were simply a way to convey the need to use s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) sparingly: <span class="bold1"><i><span style="font-weight:normal">D. (R.)</span></i></span><span class="bold1"><span style="font-weight:normal">,</span></span> at para. 53. However, it expressed the view that the third ground for detention is not limited to the most heinous of offences and can be invoked even if the community has not experienced the same horror and fear as was the case in <i>Hall</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[40]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I see two reasons — one based on legislation and the other on the case law — why Canadian appellate courts may have adopted such interpretations.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[41]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">First, the former wording of s. 515(10) <i>Cr. C.</i> — the one in effect, <i>inter alia</i>, at the time of <i>Morales</i> — specified two grounds for pre-trial detention, a <i>primary</i> ground and a <i>secondary</i> ground. The primary ground, set out in s. 515(10)(<i>a</i>), was that detention of the accused was necessary “to ensure his or her attendance in court in order to be dealt with according to law”. The secondary ground, under s. 515(10)(<i>b</i>), was that detention of the accused was necessary “in the public interest or for the protection or safety of the public, having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if he is released from custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice”. An accused could be detained on the secondary ground only if detention was not justified on the primary ground set out in s. 515(10)(<i>a</i>)<span style="letter-spacing:
-.15pt">. It was the secondary ground for detention that was at issue in </span><i>Morales</i> and, as I mentioned above, its “public interest” component was struck down by this Court. However, since the change made to the wording in 1997, s. 515(10) has no longer provided for a hierarchy of grounds for detention. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[42]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Second, it seems to me that the position taken by certain courts originates in a misinterpretation of <i>Hall</i>. As Justice </span><span style="line-height:200%">Trotter points out, there are cases in which courts, although acknowledging the authority of the Chief Justice’s reasons in <i>Hall</i>, have actually seemed to prefer the minority’s reasons: <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i> (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 3-45. The dissenting judges would have struck down s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> in its entirety, since they did not think it lent itself to a piecemeal analysis: <i>Hall</i>, at para. 88. In their view, the factors listed in that provision served as a “facade of precision”, and it was difficult to see how they could promote the proper administration of justice in cases in which the grounds set out in s. 515(10)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) were not already applicable: paras. 98-99. They were also of the opinion that the phrase “maintain confidence in the administration of justice” essentially revived the old “public interest” ground that the Court had struck down in <i>Morales</i> and invoked “similarly vague notions of the public image of the criminal justice system”: para. 104. Since <i>Hall</i>, some courts have therefore found, using the minority’s reasons to bolster this view, that the majority’s reasons advocated a restrictive interpretation of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>): Trotter, at p. 3-45. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The crime at issue in <i>Hall</i> was a particularly heinous one: the murder of a woman who had 37 slash wounds on her body</span><span style="line-height:200%">. Her assailant had intended to cut her head off. The murder had caused significant public concern. The accused had applied for bail, which the justice had denied on the basis of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i></span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">This Court described the crime as “heinous and unexplained”: <i>Hall</i>, at para. 25. It also quoted a comment from <i>R. v. Rondeau</i> (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 474 (C.A.), at p. 480, that [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “[t]he more a crime like the present one is unexplained and unexplainable, the more worrisome bail becomes for society”: <i>Hall</i>, at para. 25. I note that the decision in <i>Rondeau</i> concerned what was at that time the secondary ground for detention, that is, the need to detain the accused for the protection or safety of the public. Section 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> was not yet in force when that case was decided.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The following passage from <i>Hall</i> is also worth reproducing:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, as here, the crime is horrific, inexplicable, and strongly linked to the accused, a justice system that cannot detain the accused risks losing the public confidence upon which the bail system and the justice system as a whole repose. [para. 40]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[46]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I am of the opinion that some courts have misinterpreted this Court’s decision in <i>Hall</i>. First of all, the Court’s comments must be viewed in the context of that case and analyzed in light of the case’s very specific circumstances: the crime was an extremely horrific one. It was therefore natural for the Court to take this into account when applying s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>The Court’s description of the crime as horrific, heinous and unexplained was simply an observation, a description of the facts considered by the Court in its analysis of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>It cannot be read as imposing conditions or prerequisites. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In my view, the question whether a crime is “unexplainable” or “unexplained” is not a criterion that should guide justices in their analysis under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>). Apart from the fact that the provision itself does not even refer to such a criterion, I consider the concept ambiguous and confusing. What is meant by an “unexplainable” crime? Is it a crime against a random victim? A crime that could be committed only by a person who is not rational? An especially horrific crime? </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Moreover, many crimes may be “explainable” in one way or another; for example, it may be that the assailant was provoked by the victim or that he or she had a mental illness or was intoxicated. From this perspective, the “unexplainable” crime criterion is of little assistance. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The application of a criterion based on the notion of an “unexplainable” crime could also lead to undesirable conclusions. Crimes that are truly heinous and horrific might not satisfy it. Such a criterion could therefore give the public the impression that justices are “justifying” certain crimes, that is, crimes that are “explainable”. Although this Court used the words “unexplained and unexplainable” in <i>Hall</i> in referring to the murder at issue in that case, its decision was based, first and foremost, on the brutal and heinous nature of the crime, the strong evidence tying the accused to the crime and the fact that people in the community were afraid: para. 25. In any event, the drift in the case law since <i>Hall</i> and the reasons I have stated demonstrate the need to limit recourse to such a criterion. As much as possible, it would also be wise for justices hearing applications for release to avoid attaching such a label to the circumstances of the alleged crimes that come before them so as not to give the public the impression that they are “justifying” them.</span></p>

How would such a criterion be assessed? Should justices consider how many cases have been heard (in their jurisdictions, in Canada, in the last year, etc.) and, at the same time, ensure that cases of detention based on s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) will remain “rare” if they order detention in the cases before them? Should a justice review the cases in which detention has been ordered and determine whether the facts of the case before him or her are the same (or nearly the same) as the facts of those cases? In any event, it seems to me that a “rareness” of circumstances criterion would prompt justices to engage in a comparative exercise and thus to move away from the careful examination of the circumstances of individual cases that the situation requires. In my opinion, a comparative approach such as this could potentially undermine the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. </span></p>

Summers</i>, 2014 SCC 26, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575, which concerned the sentencing provisions of s. 719(3) and (3.1) <i>Cr. C. </i>Section 719(3) provides that in determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence and may credit a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody. However, s. 719(3.1) specifies that, “if the circumstances justify it”, the maximum can be increased to one and one-half days for each day spent in custody. The Court interpreted this provision as follows:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this provision is free of any language limiting the scope of what may constitute “circumstances”. <u>The legislature could easily have provided that only “exceptional circumstances”</u> or “circumstances other than the loss of eligibility for early release and parole” justify enhanced credit.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Cronk J.A. observed, <u>language limiting the scope of the word “circumstances” is used elsewhere in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i></u>. For example, reference is made to “exceptional circumstances” or “compelling circumstances” in s. 672.14(3) (fitness assessments last no longer than 30 days, except they may last for 60 if “compelling circumstances” so warrant), s. 672.47(2) (when an accused is found unfit to stand trial, a disposition must be made within 45 days but, in “exceptional circumstances”, may be made within 90 days) and s. 742.6(16) (when an offender breaches a conditional sentence order, in “exceptional cases” some of the suspended sentence may be deemed to be time served).</p>

Parliament clearly turned its attention to the circumstances under which s. 719(3.1) should <i>not</i> apply, but did not include any limitations on the scope of “circumstances” justifying its application.

This is a balancing exercise that will enable the justice to decide whether detention is justified. </span></p>

As a result, some of the evidence admitted at this hearing may later be excluded at trial. As Justice </span><span style="line-height:200%">Trotter notes, it may be difficult to assess the strength of the prosecution’s case at such a hearing: “The expeditious and sometimes informal nature of a bail hearing may reflect an unrealistically strong case for the Crown” (p. 3-7).</span></p>

On the one hand, the prosecutor is not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence, and the justice must be careful not to play the role of trial judge or jury: matters such as the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of scientific evidence must be analyzed at trial, not at the release hearing. However, the justice who presides at that hearing must consider the quality of the evidence tendered by the prosecutor in order to determine the weight to be given to this factor in his or her balancing exercise. For example, physical evidence may be more reliable than a mere statement made by a witness, and circumstantial evidence may be less reliable than direct evidence. The existence of ample evidence may also reinforce the apparent strength of the case. </span></p>

Rather than raising a defence at the initial hearing, the latter will most likely not do so before the release hearing held upon completion of the preliminary inquiry, and may not even raise one before trial. If the accused does raise a defence, however, this becomes one of the factors the justice must assess, and if there appears to be some basis for the defence, the justice must take this into account in analyzing the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case. As the Quebec Court of Appeal noted in a relatively recent decision, [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “it would be unfair to allow the prosecution to state its case if the justice is not in a position to consider not only the weaknesses of that case, but also the defences it suggests”: <i>R. v.

But this does not mean that the justice would be justified in embarking on a complex exercise to calculate the sentence the accused might receive: it must be borne in mind that interim release occurs at the beginning of the criminal process and that the justice must avoid acting as a substitute for the trial judge. That being said, there will be cases in which a claim of mitigating or aggravating circumstances appears to have sufficient merit for it to be open to the justice to consider it in determining whether the accused is liable for a potentially “lengthy term of imprisonment”.

In fact, Parliament intended the opposite. As the Chief Justice stated in <i>Hall</i>, a justice dealing with an application for detention based on s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) must consider all the relevant circumstances, but must <i>focus particularly on the factors Parliament has specified</i>: para. 41.

The four listed circumstances are simply the main factors to be balanced by the justice, together with any other relevant factors, in determining whether, in the case before him or her, detention is necessary in order to achieve the purpose of maintaining confidence in the administration of justice in the country. This is the provision’s purpose. Although the justice must consider all the circumstances of the case and engage in a balancing exercise, this is the ultimate question the justice must answer, and it must therefore guide him or her in making a determination. The argument that detention must automatically be ordered if the review of the four circumstances favours that result is incompatible with the balancing exercise required by s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) and with the purpose of that exercise.</span></p>

The justice might also consider the status of the victim and the impact on society of a crime committed against that person.

In other words, the criterion of the public perception must not be that of the lowest common denominator. [Emphasis added.]</p>

This being said, although it is true that the public in question consists of reasonable, well-informed persons, and not overly emotional members of the community, it seems to me that some of the decisions have rendered the word “public” meaningless in this context. Parliament made an express choice by using the word “<i>public</i>” in the French version of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) in requiring that the courts take confidence in the administration of justice into account in deciding whether an accused should be detained pending trial. It referred not to legal experts or judges, but to the “public”. Meaning must therefore be given to this legislative choice. Public confidence cannot be equated with the confidence of legal experts in the administration of justice. The Canadian public — even its most knowledgeable members — cannot be expected to have the same level of legal knowledge as judges or lawyers. That would distort the meaning of the word “public”. It would also disregard the purpose of this provision, which is to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. </span></p>

In <i>R. v.</i> <i>Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, Lamer J., writing for the majority, put the relevant question in figurative terms: “Would the admission of the evidence bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes of the reasonable man, dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances of the case?” (p. 282, quoting Y.-M.

Lamer J. stated that “[t]he reasonable person is usually the average person in the community, but only when that community’s current mood is reasonable”: <i>Collins</i>, at p. 282<i>. </i>He explained that the reasonable person test “serves as a reminder to each individual judge that his discretion is grounded in community values, and, in particular, long term community values. He should not render a decision that would be unacceptable to the community when that community is not being wrought with passion or otherwise under passing stress due to current events”: <i>ibid.</i>, at pp. 282-83; see also <i>R. v.

He or she also expects that someone charged with a crime will be tried within a reasonable period of time, and is aware of the adage that “justice delayed is justice denied”: <i>R. v. Trout</i>, 2006 MBCA 96, 205 Man. R. (2d) 277, at para. 15. Finally, a reasonable member of the public knows that a criminal offence requires proof of culpable intent (<i>mens rea</i>) and that the purpose of certain defences is to show the absence of such intent. A well-known example of this type of defence is the mental disorder defence. The person contemplated by s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> therefore understands that such a defence, once established, will enable an accused to avoid criminal responsibility. However, it would be going too far to expect the person in question to master all the subtleties of complex defences, especially where there is overwhelming evidence of the crime, the circumstances of the crime are heinous and the accused admits committing it.</span></p>

C. </i>is a thoughtful person, not one who is prone to emotional reactions, whose knowledge of the circumstances of a case is inaccurate or who disagrees with our society’s fundamental values. But he or she is not a legal expert familiar with all the basic principles of the criminal justice system, the elements of criminal offences or the subtleties of criminal intent and of the defences that are available to accused persons. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">It is of course not easy for judges to strike an appropriate balance between the unrealistic expectations they might have for the public on the one hand, and the need to refuse to yield to public reactions driven solely by emotion on the other. This exercise may be particularly difficult in this era characterized by the multiplication and diversification of information sources, access to 24-hour news reports and the advent of social media. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Canadians may in fact think they are very well informed, but that is unfortunately not always the case. Moreover, people can also make their reactions known much more quickly, more effectively and on a wider scale than in the past, in particular through the social media mentioned above, which are conducive to chain reactions. The courts must therefore be careful not to yield to purely emotional public reactions or reactions that may be based on inadequate knowledge of the real circumstances of a case. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">However, the courts must also be sensitive to the perceptions of people who are reasonable and well informed. This enables the courts to act both as watchdogs against mob justice and as guardians of public confidence in our justice system. It would therefore be dangerous, inappropriate and wrong for judges to base their decisions on media reports that are in no way representative of a well-informed public. Indeed, the Quebec Court of Appeal recognized this risk in its recent decision in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Turcotte</i>, 2014 QCCA 2190:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>]&nbsp; The press clippings show how risky it is to rely on this mode of proof. They contain several different opinions that vary in the degree to which they are balanced, objective, moderate or superficial. Many of them contain inaccurate facts or do not mention the essential facts. Most of them say nothing about the legal principles that must be applied in making release decisions. Certain opinions stir up anger and distort the debate. Few accurately report the facts and correctly state the applicable principles. On the whole, it must be acknowledged that they do not satisfy the reasonable person test defined in the case law. [para. 68 (CanLII)]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Having said this, I wish to point out that this does not mean the courts must automatically disregard evidence that comes from the news media. It must be recognized that the media are part of life in society and that they reflect the opinions of certain segments of the Canadian public. In <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. New Brunswick (Attorney General)</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 459, at p. 475, this Court noted: “The media have a vitally important role to play in a democratic society. It is the media that, by gathering and disseminating news, enable members of our society to make an informed assessment of the issues which may significantly affect their lives and well-being.” Such opinion evidence can therefore be considered by the courts when it is admissible and relevant. This will be the case where it corresponds to the opinion of the reasonable person I described above. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I should mention, however, that since <i>Turcotte</i> has not been brought before this Court, it would be inappropriate for me to speak to the correctness of the Court of Appeal’s conclusion with respect to release in that case. I will simply observe that the soundness of that conclusion must be assessed in light of the principles I have already outlined.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In short, there is not just one way to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. It may be undermined not only if a justice declines to order the interim detention of an accused in circumstances that justify detention, but also if a justice orders detention where such a result is not justified. </span></p>

C.</i> enables the <i>prosecutor</i> to apply to a judge for a review of a release order made in relation to an accused. Sections 520 and 521 are worded similarly. In both cases, the application may be made “at any time before the trial”: ss. 520(1) and 521(1) <i>Cr.

C. </i>Not all lower courts in Canada are agreed on the nature of this review process. Some consider it an appeal, which means that only an error of law or principle will provide a basis for a “review”. Others take the view that they have full discretion to vary the initial order even in the absence of an error. This approach is sometimes described as a “<i>de novo</i>” hearing, although, as Justice Trotter points out, a true <i>de novo</i> hearing is conducted as if there were no previous proceedings: p. 8-13. Finally, other courts treat the review under ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> as a hybrid remedy. In their view, the section authorizes the accused and the prosecutor to present new evidence to show a change in circumstances, and to raise an error of law or principle by the justice to justify a review of the initial order. </span></p>

Nonetheless, they establish a hybrid remedy and therefore provide greater scope than an appeal for varying the initial order.</span></p>

If Parliament had intended for reviewing judges to conduct a true <i>de novo</i> hearing, it would have specified this in the legislation. As well, ss. 520(7) and 521(8) provide that the review is conducted on the basis of the transcript and exhibits from the initial proceedings, although some new evidence is admissible. I will return to this point below. For the moment, it is enough to say that these factors confirm my conclusion that ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> do not establish a <i>de novo</i> proceeding.</span></p>

C.</i> expressly limit its exercise in favour of the accused or the prosecutor, as the case may be, to cases in which cause is shown. It should be borne in mind that, in the old <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en" target="_blank">Young Offenders Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-y-1-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, Parliament used the word “discretion” in referring to the reviewing court’s power over the transfer of young accused persons to ordinary court: s. 16(9) and (10). This Court found that the use of that word conferred a broad power of review on the reviewing court and authorized that court to make an independent evaluation and to arrive at an independent conclusion on the same facts: <i><span style="letter-spacing:
-.15pt">R. v. M. (S.H.)</span></i><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">,</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446. But Parliament did not choose to use the same wording in ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i></span></span></p>

Paradoxically, the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal arrived at different outcomes even though they both based their decisions on an analogy with the review procedure provided for in s. 680 <i>Cr.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[104]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">For the purposes of this appeal, I do not have to determine the validity of the positions taken by appellate courts with respect to s. 680(1) <i>Cr.

 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Comparison Between the Appeal From a Sentence and the Review Procedure Provided for in Sections 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The appellant points to similarities between the interim release decision and the sentencing decision. In the appellant’s view, these similarities mean that a release decision should be reviewed on the basis of the same principles that guide a sentence appeal under s. 687 <i>Cr. C.</i><i> </i>Relying on <i>R. v. Shropshire</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, <i>R. v. McDonnell</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, <i>R. v. L.M</i><i>.</i>, 2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, and <i>R. v. Nasogaluak</i>, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, the appellant asserts that a superior court conducting a review under ss. 520 and 521 should reverse the initial decision and substitute another one for it only if the initial decision contains an error in principle that affects the result, or if it is clearly inappropriate or clearly unreasonable.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In the respondent’s view, the distinctions between the sentencing decision and the interim release decision are so great that no similarity would justify equating the rules for one with the rules for the other. According to the respondent, the right to interim release is a constitutional right, whereas the sentencing principle requiring consideration of whether “less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances” (s. 718.2(<i>d</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i>) is not important enough to justify this analogy.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">It is true that there are similarities between the interim release decision and the sentencing decision. Although both these decisions are discretionary, specific statutory rules apply to each of them. In both cases, the rules on the admissibility of evidence are relaxed: ss. 518 and 723 <i>Cr. C. </i>As well, the release of an accused must be ordered unless the prosecution shows cause why detention is justified: s. 515(2) and (10) <i>Cr. C. </i>Similarly, the sentencing judge must opt for the least restrictive sanction having regard to the circumstances: s. 718.2(<i>d</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>Finally, the various possibilities available to the judge are similar. In the case of interim release, the justice may release the accused without conditions, impose statutory conditions for interim release of the accused (with or without sureties), require the payment of a deposit or order the detention of the accused: s. 515(1), (2)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>), (4) to (4.3), (5) and (8) <i>Cr. C. </i>In the case of sentencing, the judge may discharge the accused, impose statutory conditions of probation, fine the accused or sentence the accused to a term of imprisonment: ss. 730, 731, 734 and 732.1(3) <i>Cr. C.</i> </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">However, there are also some significant differences between the interim release decision and the sentencing decision. In <i>Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd</i>. <i>v. Canada</i>, 2010 SCC 21, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 721, this Court discussed the expeditious nature of our interim release system and the implications of that nature:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. s. 503(1)(<i>a</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> requires that a person who is arrested and detained be taken before a justice “without unreasonable delay” and in any event within 24 hours after the arrest. Section 515 <i>Cr. C.</i> provides that the justice <i>shall</i> release the person unless the prosecution shows cause why the detention should be continued. The grounds that can be relied on to deny the person’s release are limited. <u>In the short time it has before it must show cause why the detention of the accused is justified</u>, the prosecution has to gather the evidence it intends to use at the bail hearing, which means it may have insufficient time to meet with witnesses and further investigate the matters relevant to bail. Section 516(1) <i>Cr. C.</i> provides that the adjournment of a bail hearing cannot exceed three days except with the consent of the accused; and orders can be reviewed at the request of the accused provided that the accused has given the prosecution two days’ notice (s. 520(1) and (2) <i>Cr. C</i>.).</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid any delay prejudicial to an accused who ought to be released, while at the same time ensuring that those who do not meet the criteria for release are kept in custody, <u>compromises had to be made regarding the nature of the evidence to be adduced at the bail hearing</u>. There are practically no prohibitions as regards the evidence the prosecution can lead to show cause why the detention of the accused in custody is justified. According to s. 518(1)(<i>e</i>) <i>Cr. C</i>., the prosecutor may lead any evidence that is “credible or trustworthy”, which might include evidence of a confession that has not been tested for voluntariness or consistency with the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, bad character, information obtained by wiretap, hearsay statements, ambiguous post-offence conduct, untested similar facts, prior convictions, untried charges, or personal information on living and social habits. The justice has a broad discretion to “make such inquiries, on oath or otherwise, of and concerning the accused as he considers desirable” (s. 518(1)(<i>a</i>)). <u>The process is informal; the bail hearing can even take place over the phone</u> (s. 515(2.2)). [Underlining added; paras. 27-28.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">This conscious choice to expedite the release hearing is grounded in the importance our society attaches to the presumption of innocence and the right of individuals to liberty even when charged with a serious criminal offence. However, this expeditious process is not without consequences for the accused, who generally has very little time to choose counsel and may even have no legal representation at the release hearing. The accused, or his or her counsel, also has very little time to, <i>inter alia</i>, review and analyze the prosecutor’s evidence, devise a defence strategy and make the best possible decisions on how to proceed. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On the other hand, the sentencing judge is often the judge who presided over the trial of the accused. Thus, even though the appellant argues that the rules on the admissibility of evidence are relaxed, a sentencing decision is made at the end of a long process during which the judge has generally analyzed an abundance of evidence and is more familiar with the situation of the accused. The sentencing judge is therefore not in the same position as the justice who must decide whether to grant the accused interim release. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Finally, it is important to note that, at the time of sentencing, the accused has already been convicted and is therefore no longer presumed innocent. However, the sentence could have a longer-term impact on the life of the accused than would interim detention. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[112]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Thus, although a comparison between the interim release decision and the sentencing decision is interesting, it cannot in itself be determinative, given the differences between these two types of decisions. </span></p>
 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nature of the Decision Reviewed Under Sections 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[113]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The decision concerning the interim release of an accused is often characterized as “discretionary”. This word must be used carefully in the context of this provision of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, since release of the accused remains the rule, the exception being where his or her detention is justified on one of the grounds set out in s. 515(10) <i>Cr. C.</i> </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[114]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Nevertheless, s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) requires the justice to balance several factors, including the ones listed in that provision. In this balancing exercise, the justice must for the most part make findings of fact and assess the weight of those findings to determine whether detention is justified. Thus, the provision requires the justice to assess the appropriateness of a decision, which, from this perspective, can be characterized as “discretionary”. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[115]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I have already dealt with the argument concerning the similarity between the release decision and the sentencing decision. It will be helpful to return here to the discretionary nature of the sentencing decision. In <i><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Shropshire</span></i><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">, this Court reproduced comments that had been made by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, quoting <i>R. v.

If a sentence imposed is not clearly excessive or inadequate it is a fit sentence assuming the trial judge applied the correct principles and considered all relevant facts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My view is premised on the reality that <u>sentencing is not an exact science; it is anything but</u>. <u>It is the exercise of judgment</u> taking into consideration relevant legal principles, the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The most that can be expected of a sentencing judge is to arrive at a sentence that is within an acceptable range. In my opinion, that is the true basis upon which Courts of Appeal review sentences when the only issue is whether the sentence is inadequate or excessive. [para. 48]</p>

The weighing of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of discretion is all about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <u>Only if by emphasizing one factor or by not giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his or her discretion unreasonably</u> should an appellate court interfere with the sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in principle.

However, the passages reproduced above aptly convey the implications of a discretionary decision that involves the balancing of a number of factors. As I explained above, a decision with respect to release made on the basis of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> calls for the consideration of several factors that may be difficult to balance. This is a delicate exercise whose essence would be distorted if an open-ended discretion to review the initial release decision were to be conferred on the judge. </span></p>

C.</i> do not provide for a <i>de novo</i> hearing. Thus, unless there is new evidence — a subject I will address below — the reviewing judge is not in a better position than the justice to evaluate whether the detention of the accused is necessary. In addition, the reviewing judge has, in relation to the justice, no special expertise with respect to release. </span></p>

 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conclusion: The Review Provided for in Sections 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> Is a Hybrid Remedy</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[120]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On the basis of the wording of ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i>, a comparison with other review provisions and with sentence appeals, and the nature of the decision being reviewed, I conclude that these sections do not confer on the reviewing judge an open-ended power to review the initial order respecting the detention or release of the accused. The reviewing judge must therefore determine whether it is appropriate to exercise this power of review. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[121]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">It will be appropriate to intervene if the justice has erred in law. It will also be appropriate for the reviewing judge to exercise this power if the impugned decision was clearly inappropriate, that is, if the justice who rendered it gave excessive weight to one relevant factor or insufficient weight to another. The reviewing judge therefore does not have the power to interfere with the initial decision simply because he or she would have weighed the relevant factors differently. I reiterate that the relevant factors are not limited to the ones expressly specified in s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>Finally, where new evidence is submitted by the accused or the prosecutor as permitted by ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i>, the reviewing judge may vary the initial decision if that evidence shows a material and relevant change in the circumstances of the case.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[124]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The appellant submits that this evidence is limited to facts that are truly new in the sense that they have come to light since the initial decision. It therefore does not include facts that could have been alleged at the initial hearing or during a previous review. Otherwise, the system could encourage “judge shopping”.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[125]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">It is true that the principle of finality of judgments and that of the need to avoid a multiplicity of unwarranted court proceedings are important, and the courts must not facilitate “judge shopping”. However, it is going too far to say, as the appellant does, that it might be in an arrested person’s interest to tender a minimum of evidence at the initial release hearing and then, should that prove to be insufficient, to adduce evidence on review that had existed at the time of that hearing but had not been used then. Detained persons generally do everything in their power to be released as quickly as possible. The appellant’s argument reflects a misunderstanding of the impact of detention on an individual, particularly when it may be unjustified: see, e.g., <i>Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.</i>, at para. 51, quoting <i>Hall</i>, at para. 47; <i>Ell v. Alberta</i>, 2003 SCC 35, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 857, at para. 24. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[126]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">That the fear expressed by the appellant goes too far seems even clearer to me given the fact that, following a first application for review under ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i>, a further application may not be made, except with leave of a judge, prior to the expiration of 30 days: ss. 520(8) and 521(9) <i>Cr. C.</i> </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[127]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I am instead of the opinion that the reason why detained persons may not always tender all possible evidence at their first hearing lies in the generally expeditious nature of the release process and in the consequences of that nature, namely the short time between arrest and hearing, a lack of representation for accused persons, and incomplete evidence at this stage. The interests of justice would therefore be undermined if courts acting under ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> were to adopt a narrow view regarding the “new evidence” that can be admitted under those sections. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[128]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In <i>Palmer v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, this Court established the following criteria that must be met for evidence to be considered “new evidence” on appeal:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-31.5pt">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-31.5pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-31.5pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-31.5pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief, and</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-31.5pt">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:76.3pt;text-indent:-76.3pt">(Reproduced in <i>R. v. Warsing</i>, <span class="reflex3-block">[1998] 3 S.C.R. 579</span>, at para. 50.)</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[129]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In my opinion, the four criteria from <i>Palmer</i> are relevant, with any necessary modifications, to the determination of what constitutes new evidence for the purposes of the review provided for in ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C. </i>Given the generally expeditious nature of the interim release process and the risks of violating the rights of the accused, and since the release hearing takes place at the very start of criminal proceedings and not at the end like the sentence appeal, a reviewing judge must be flexible in applying these four criteria. I reiterate at the outset that the rules of evidence are relaxed in the context of the release hearing: s. 518 <i>Cr. C.</i></span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[130]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The first criterion — due diligence — exists to ensure finality and order, which are values that are essential to the integrity of the criminal process: <i>R. v. G.D.B</i><i>.</i>, 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 19, quoting <i>R. v. M. (P.S.) </i></span><span class="reflex3-block">(1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.)</span><span style="line-height:200%">, at p. 411. The appellant relies on these same values to limit what constitutes new evidence in this case. However, the pre-trial detention of accused persons — like their release — is, by its nature, very often “interim” and not final.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[131]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Moreover, despite the importance of these values, this Court has also stated that the due diligence criterion should not be applied as strictly in criminal matters as in civil cases: <i>Palmer</i>, at p. 775, quoting <i>McMartin v. The Queen</i>, [1964] S.C.R. 484, at p. 493. The weight to be given to this criterion depends on the strength of the other criteria or, in other words, on the totality of the circumstances: <i>R. v.</i> <i>Price</i>, </span><span class="reflex3-block">[1993] 3 S.C.R. 633, at p. 634; see also </span><i><span style="line-height:200%">Warsing</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">, at para. 51</span><span class="reflex3-block">. </span><span style="line-height:200%">In <i>G.D.B</i><i>.</i>, this Court stated that “an appellate court should determine the reason why the evidence was not available at the trial”: para. 20. A generous and liberal interpretation of the meaning of “new evidence” in the context of ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> is thus quite consistent with the principles developed by this Court. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[132]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I am therefore of the opinion that a reviewing judge may consider evidence that is truly new or evidence that existed at the time of the initial release hearing but was not tendered for some reason that is legitimate and reasonable. This is how the “due diligence” criterion from <i>Palmer</i> must be understood in the context of the review provided for in ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C. </i>The nature of the release system and the risks associated with it demand no less. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[133]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">I wish to be clear that such new evidence is not limited to evidence that was unavailable to the accused before the initial hearing because, for example, the prosecutor did not disclose it to the accused. It is possible that the prosecutor will give the evidence to the accused only at the very last minute before, or very shortly before, the initial hearing. Depending on the circumstances of a given case, it could be unreasonable and unfair to say that if the accused does not use such evidence at the initial hearing, he or she will be precluded from adducing it on a subsequent application for review, that is, after his or her counsel has had the necessary time to analyze it and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using it. In each case, the reviewing judge will have to determine whether the reason why the accused did not tender such pre-existing evidence earlier was legitimate and reasonable. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[134]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">This requirement to show a reason that was legitimate and reasonable means that it will be open to the reviewing judge to refuse to admit new evidence where it is alleged to have actually been in the interest of the accused to drag out the application for release or where the accused is alleged to have tried to use the review to engage in judge shopping. In this way, the conception of new evidence in the context of ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i> reflects both the need to ensure the integrity of our criminal justice system and the need to protect the rights of accused persons in proceedings that are generally expeditious. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[135]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">As to the second <i>Palmer </i>criterion, the evidence obviously does not have to “bea[r] upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial”: p. 775. It will suffice if the evidence is relevant for the purposes of s. 515(10) <i>Cr. C.</i> Where, more specifically, the third ground for detention under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) — the one at issue here — is concerned, I note that the justice must consider “all the circumstances”. The second <i>Palmer</i> criterion will therefore rarely be decisive in the context of an application for review under ss. 520 and 521 <i>Cr. C.</i>, since the range of “relevant” evidence will generally be quite broad. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[136]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The third criterion — that the evidence “must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief” (<i>Palmer</i>, at p. 775) — must be interpreted in light of the relaxation of the rules of evidence at the bail stage and in particular of s. 518(1)(<i>e</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i>, which provides that “the justice may receive and base his decision on evidence considered credible or trustworthy by him in the circumstances of each case”.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[137]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Finally, the fourth <i>Palmer</i> criterion should be modified as follows: the new evidence must be such that it is reasonable to think, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that it could have affected the balancing exercise engaged in by the justice under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>The new evidence must therefore be significant.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[138]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">If the new evidence meets the four criteria for admissibility, the reviewing judge is authorized to repeat the analysis under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> as if he or she were the initial decision-maker. The reviewing judge must therefore consider all the circumstances of the case, focusing in particular on the circumstances specified in that provision. The judge must then undertake a balancing exercise and determine, from the perspective of the public, whether the detention of the accused is still justified. The <i>Palmer</i> criteria, modified as I have just done, must not be applied in a manner that delays or needlessly complicates the release process. As I explained above, that process, by its very nature, generally requires an expeditious and flexible procedure. The criteria therefore serve as guidelines for the reviewing judge, but they must not have the effect of creating a procedural straightjacket that would interfere with the administration of justice.</span></p>

Judge Lavergne also noted that the video showed that the young men had spat at the driver while getting off the bus. This appeared to provoke a reaction by the driver, who stood up and went to the door of the bus. Judge Lavergne wrote that the driver had in all likelihood said something to the young men, who had then rushed back onto the bus. That was when the assault began. </span></p>

According to Martin J., the starting point for the events taken into account by Judge Lavergne seemed to be the moment when the three young men had stood up at the back of the bus to go to the front. However, in Martin J.’s view, the events had instead started when the driver had refused to open the bus doors to let the young men on at a previous stop. Martin J. also pointed out that, once the three young men had gotten off the bus, the driver had jumped up from his seat and headed for the door. Following a verbal exchange, the driver went back to sit down, followed by the young men, who got back on the bus. At that moment, the driver turned toward them and took [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation] </span>“a certain physical action against one of the individuals”: para. 11. It was from that point on, according to Martin J., that the situation degenerated. </span></p>

The transcript from the initial hearing seems to indicate that this was not discussed by counsel of record. Judge Lavergne also did not refer to the physical action the driver had taken against the young men before they assaulted him. These details came from a statement made by a passenger, which was not given to counsel for the respondent until the morning of the hearing before Judge Lavergne. The investigating officer, who testified for the prosecution, referred to the passenger’s statement, but this specific point was not mentioned. When cross-examining the investigating officer, counsel for the respondent did not bring up the passenger’s statement. In light of my conclusions with respect to “new evidence” and of the fact that counsel did not receive the statement until the morning of the initial hearing, this fact could have constituted a reason that was legitimate and reasonable for not using it at that hearing but then doing so at a subsequent hearing. </span></p>

Counsel also observed that, after being spat at, the driver had spoken aggressively to the three young men and had allegedly pushed the first of the young men who had gotten back on the bus. Counsel for the respondent then filed the passenger’s statement in evidence. </span></p>

This statement is perfectly consistent with this Court’s decision in <i>Hall</i>. Judge Lavergne added that the onus was on the prosecutor to show that the detention of the accused was justified. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[151]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">It is true that Judge Lavergne did not elaborate on his finding that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proof under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) in this case. However, when considered as a whole, his decision was detailed enough for a reviewing judge to be able to understand the grounds on which he had based his detention order. He referred to the first three factors, which he had already discussed in the context of s. 515(10)(<i>b</i>). On the fourth factor, he stated that the accused was liable for a potentially <span style="font-variant:small-caps">[translation] </span>“significant” term. In his analysis under s. 515(10)(<i>b</i>), Judge Lavergne considered the following circumstances surrounding the offence: (1) the three young men had allegedly shouted abuse and insults at the driver during the bus ride; (2) they had spat at him when getting off the bus; (3) the driver had then stood up and gone to the door and had, in all likelihood, said something to the young men; and (4) the young men had gotten back on the bus, rushed at the driver and beat him severely. Judge Lavergne also noted that the respondent had been an active participant and that the existence of the videotape meant that a conviction was highly likely.</span></p>

C.</i>, and not only under s. 515(10)(<i>b</i>). As I mentioned above, however, the question whether an offence is unexplainable or unexplained is not a criterion that should guide justices in their analysis under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr.

C. </i>After finding that Judge Lavergne had not had all the circumstances before him at the initial hearing, Martin J. wrote that this was not a totally gratuitous and unexplained or unexplainable incident. He then reviewed the history of s. 515(10) <i>Cr. C.</i> and the case law on s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>), finding that the latter provision had to be used [<span style="font-variant:

C.</i> must be interpreted narrowly and applied only in rare cases. In addition, the offence being “explainable” proved to be a determinative factor in his decision, although he did properly recognize the seriousness of the offence and its [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation] “</span>heinous” and “repugnant” nature. Moreover, he reversed the decisions of Judge Lavergne and Judge Legault without even considering the four factors set out in s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C. </i>Martin J. therefore made several errors that justify reviewing his entire decision. </span></p>

Indeed, in my opinion, the detention of the respondent was justified under s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>)</span> <i><span style="line-height:200%">Cr. C.</span></i><span style="line-height:200%"> </span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[160]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">First of all, the prosecution’s case appears to be strong, since the incident was videotaped and there is eyewitness testimony. Real evidence such as a videotape is more reliable than circumstantial or testimonial evidence. In addition, the respondent does not seem, <i>prima facie</i>, to have a valid defence to put forward, even if the driver’s [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation] </span>“physical action” against the respondent and his co-accused were to be taken into account. Indeed, the respondent did not argue in this Court that he had a valid defence that could limit the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case. Although it is not my role — nor is it the role of a bail judge — to analyze in detail the possible outcomes of a future trial, it is difficult to imagine, at first glance, how self-defence could be available to the respondent. At this stage of the proceedings, the evidence does not logically support an argument by the respondent that he used reasonable force to defend or protect himself or to protect another person, or that the act he committed was reasonable in the circumstances: s. 34 <i>Cr. C. </i>It should also be noted that the defence of provocation is not available, given that it applies only to reduce a murder charge: s. 232 <i>Cr. C.</i></span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[161]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The offence is objectively very serious, since it is aggravated assault and since the maximum sentence of 14 years for that offence is among the most severe in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> after imprisonment for life: para. 268(2). </span></p>

The fact that an offence is violent, brutal or heinous is clearly an important factor that a justice can consider. The fact that the driver had refused to wait for the young men at a previous stop is of no relevance in this analysis. Moreover, I have difficulty seeing why the physical action the driver allegedly took — pushing a friend of the respondent’s — should even be considered to favour the respondent in light of the insults and threats directed at him during the ride. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[163]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Finally, the maximum sentence for aggravated assault is 14 years. If the respondent were instead convicted of assault causing bodily harm, the maximum sentence would be 10 years: s. 267(<i>b</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> Neither offence carries a minimum sentence. Courts have held that [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation] </span>“this type of crime, aggravated assault, generally demands an unconditional term of imprisonment to properly express society’s denunciation of crimes of violence against the person and to send a clear message of deterrence”: <i>R. v. Dagenais</i>, 2012 QCCA 244, at para. 18 (CanLII); <i>R. v. Riendeau</i>, 2012 QCCA 1155, at para. 32; see also C. C. Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, <i>Sentencing</i> (8th ed. 2012), at § 23.230. Even though the respondent had no criminal record and was only 20 years old at the time of the events, he will, if convicted, likely be sentenced to a significant term of imprisonment in light of the circumstances of the offence, and in particular of his active participation in and the violent nature of the assault. Therefore, there is no doubt that he is liable for a potentially “lengthy term of imprisonment” within the meaning of s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr. C.</i> if he is convicted of either aggravated assault or assault causing bodily harm.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[164]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Accordingly, the four circumstances set out in s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[165]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In my view, the fact that the assault was committed against a bus driver, a civil servant who works in the community to ensure the well-being of the public, makes the offence even more heinous. Also relevant are the nature and severity of the injuries sustained by the driver, and in particular the long-term effects and the impact on his career and his personal life. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[166]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In short, I find that, when all the relevant circumstances are weighed as required by s. 515(10)(<i>c</i>) <i>Cr.

Such members of the public are not people who would allow themselves to be guided by their emotions and to be swayed by the mob or by incomplete or distorted information. In the face of such a brutal attack that was committed by several people in the middle of the night against a bus driver, a person who was serving the community, and that had serious consequences for the victim’s health and integrity and was captured on a videotape that left no doubt as to the respondent’s active participation in the assault, I believe that the confidence in our justice system of a reasonable member of our society would be undermined if the interim detention of the respondent were not ordered. </span></p>
