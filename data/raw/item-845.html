In light of the unsophisticated nature of the beeper, it seems that the essential evidence was obtained by direct observation.&nbsp; In any event, evidence as to movement of the vehicle was certainly not "undiscoverable".&nbsp; It follows that the admission of the evidence as to the location of the car could not be said to affect the fairness of the trial.</span></p>

Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; <i>R. v. Moran</i> (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225; <i>R. v. Wong</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36.&nbsp; While I am prepared to acknowledge that, as compared to the home, the individual has a diminished expectation of privacy in respect of his or her automobile, nonetheless an automobile is so central to one's daily life that the interior of the vehicle immediately jumps to mind as being an area meriting protection against state intrusion; see in this context <i>Cardwell v. Lewis</i>, 417 U.S. 583 (1974), at p. 591.&nbsp; In the present case, there were no exigent circumstances, and the activities of the police were not authorized.&nbsp; The search warrant had expired and, for that matter, it did not authorize that kind of search.</span></p>

Southam Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, and has consistently reasserted it since, in particular in relation to devices for electronic surveillance; see <i>Duarte</i> and <i>Wong</i>.&nbsp; The Court thus stated the rationale for this position in <i>Duarte</i>, at p. 44:</span></p>

Southam</i>, <i>supra</i>, instructs us, the issuance of a warrant to conduct a search will ordinarily call for an objective showing of reasonable and probable cause by those seeking the warrant.&nbsp; I see no reason why this should not, at least generally, be the case when one seeks to employ electronic tracking devices in the pursuit of an individual.&nbsp; Given the somewhat less intrusive nature of this means of surveillance, if properly controlled, than electronic audio or video surveillance, a case might be made for empowering a judicial officer in certain circumstances to accept a somewhat lower standard, such as the "solid ground" for suspicion which the peace officers claimed here, if it can be established that such a power is necessary for the control of certain types of dangerous or pernicious crimes.&nbsp; A passage in <i>Hunter v. Southam</i>, cited <i>infra</i>, contemplates the possibility of varying the standard in certain circumstances, and a lowering of the standard was approved for entry into the country even without judicial authorization in <i>R. v. Simmons</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495.&nbsp; Still this should not be permissible in the absence of cogent reasons.</span></p>

Southam</i>, <i>supra</i>, instructs us that there may be occasions where danger to some person may constitute a ground for lowering the standard.&nbsp; At pages 167-68 of that case, the former Chief Justice, then Dickson J., observed:</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">History has confirmed the appropriateness of this requirement as the threshold for subordinating the expectation of privacy to the needs of law enforcement.&nbsp; Where the state's interest is not simply law enforcement as, for instance, where state security is involved, or where the individual's interest is not simply his expectation of privacy as, for instance, when the search threatens his bodily integrity, the relevant standard might well be a different one.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Dickson J. was there speaking of the objective standard employed by a judicial officer.&nbsp; The police also have power to act without warrant where this is required for the protection of an individual or property.&nbsp; But I do not think this affords the police a licence to engage in searches, including electronic tracking of a suspect, because they believe that a particular individual may be dangerous, and that he may therefore somewhere, sometime cause harm, even serious harm, to another.</span></p>

Greffe</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 755, at pp. 795, 796 and 799.&nbsp; In the present case the trial judge held the police had no reasonable and probable grounds, and they themselves admitted it.&nbsp; What they claimed to have, and this is precisely what the police claimed in <i>Kokesch</i>, at p. 31, where the evidence was rejected, was that they had "solid grounds".</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my colleagues both point out, the Crown has quite properly conceded that the installation of the tracking device in the appellant's automobile constitutes an unreasonable search or seizure so as to violate <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The facts are so similar to those in <i>R. v. Kokesch</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 3, that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to come to a different result with respect to violation of s. 8.&nbsp; In both cases, a trespass by the police which the police knew or ought to have known was unlawful, enabled them to engage in surveillance of the activities of a suspect which eventually led to the discovery of incriminating evidence.&nbsp; In both cases, the nexus between the trespass, the surveillance and the discovery of the evidence is sufficient to conclude that the evidence was obtained in a manner that violates the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; It is not necessary here, as it was not in <i>Kokesch</i>, to consider whether the surveillance itself, in the absence of trespass, would violate s. 8.&nbsp; While I agree with my colleague La Forest J. that legislation is desirable in this area, I would refrain from expressing an opinion as to the form that it should take.&nbsp; I am not prepared to say in advance whether prior judicial authorization will be necessary or whether statutory authority <i>simpliciter</i> will suffice.</span></p>
