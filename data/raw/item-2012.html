 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">While the Court is most often preoccupied with uses and abuses of confidential information in cases where it is sought to disqualify a lawyer from further acting in a matter, or other related relief, the duty of loyalty to a current client includes the much broader principle of avoidance of conflicts of interest, in which confidential information may or may not play a role.&nbsp; The aspects of the duty of loyalty relevant to this appeal do include issues of confidentiality in the Canada Trust matter, but engage more particularly three other dimensions:&nbsp;&nbsp;the duty to avoid conflicting interests, a duty of commitment to the client’s cause, and a duty of candour with the client on matters relevant to the retainer.&nbsp; The general rule is that a lawyer may not represent one client whose interests are directly adverse to the immediate interests of another current client&nbsp;— even if the two mandates are unrelated — unless both clients consent after receiving full disclosure (and preferably independent legal advice), and the lawyer reasonably believes that he or she is able to represent each client without adversely affecting the other.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here, the V law firm, and L in particular, put themselves in a position where the duties they undertook to other clients conflicted with the duty of loyalty which they already owed to the accused.&nbsp; Loyalty required the V law firm to focus on the interest of the accused without being distracted by other interests including personal interests.&nbsp; The V firm breached their duty to the accused in accepting a retainer that required them to put before the divorce court judge evidence of the illegal conduct of their client, the accused, at a time when they knew he was facing other criminal charges related to his paralegal practice, in which their firm had had a longstanding involvement.&nbsp; The divorce matter was adverse to the accused’s interest, and advantageous to the “cut‑throat” defence planned by his former business associate.&nbsp; Further, the V firm ought not to have met with the accused on the Canada Trust matters when it was conflicted by its <i>de facto</i> representation of his former business associate.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The law firm, as fiduciary, could not serve two masters at the same time. Having said that, the accused falls short on the issue of remedy.&nbsp; He may (and perhaps did) choose to take his complaint to the Law Society of Alberta, or seek other relief, but he is not entitled to a stay of proceedings.&nbsp; The law firm’s conduct did not affect the fairness of the divorce action trial and there was no issue of confidential information.&nbsp; L’s involvement in the divorce matter was in violation of his and the firm’s professional obligations, but it contributed little to the accused’s predicament.&nbsp; The falsification of the court documents came to light without the involvement of the V firm and the independent investigation by the police militates against a finding of abuse of process.&nbsp; This is manifestly not one of those clearest of cases where a stay of the jury’s verdict is warranted.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal was correct to remit the divorce matter to the trial judge for sentencing.</span></p>

Its involvement predated the laying of charges by the police.&nbsp; There was no issue of confidential information.&nbsp; The <i>Doblanko</i> charges were serious and would almost certainly have been laid in any event.&nbsp; In my view, the prosecution of the <i>Doblanko</i> charge was not an abuse of process.&nbsp; More specifically, I agree with the conclusion of the Alberta Court of Appeal that this is manifestly not one of those clearest of cases where a stay of the jury’s verdict of guilt&nbsp; is warranted.&nbsp; I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>

The trial judge found that as of January 1, 1995 he should be considered a member of the Venkatraman&nbsp; firm for the purpose of conflict of interest and confidentiality by virtue of the extended definition of “firm” adopted by the Law Society of Alberta in its <i>Code of Professional Conduct</i> (loose-leaf), effective January 1, 1995, at p.&nbsp;ix.&nbsp; I say “extended meaning” because the evidence established that Lazin was essentially carrying on an independent practice despite the shared facilities.&nbsp; Effective May 1, 1995, however, Lazin’s practice was rolled into the Venkatraman firm, and Lazin himself became an employee.&nbsp; He has since left.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">These words are far removed in time and place from the legal world in which the Venkatraman law firm carried on its practice, but the defining principle — the duty of loyalty — is with us still.&nbsp; It endures because it is essential to the integrity of the administration of justice and it is of high public importance that public confidence in that integrity be maintained:&nbsp; <i>MacDonald Estate v. Martin</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1235, at pp.&nbsp;1243 and 1265, and <i>Tanny v. Gurman</i>, [1994] R.D.J. 10 (Que. C.A.).&nbsp; Unless a litigant is assured of the undivided loyalty of the lawyer, neither the public nor the litigant will have confidence that the legal system, which may appear to them to be a hostile and hideously complicated environment, is a reliable and trustworthy means of resolving their disputes and controversies: <i>R. v. McClure</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445, 2001 SCC 14, at para. 2; <i>Smith v. Jones</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 455.&nbsp; As O’Connor J.A. (now A.C.J.O.) observed in <i>R. v. McCallen</i> (1999), 43 O.R.

24.4pt">. . . the relationship of counsel and client requires clients, typically untrained in the law and lacking the skills of advocates, to entrust the management and conduct of their cases to the counsel who act on their behalf.&nbsp; There should be no room for doubt about counsel’s loyalty and dedication to the client’s case.</p>

Parsons</i> (1992), 100 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 260, where the accused was charged with the first degree murder of his mother.&nbsp; The Crown sought to remove defence counsel on the basis that he had previously acted for the father of the accused in an unrelated matrimonial matter, and might in future have to cross-examine the father at the son’s trial for murder.&nbsp; The accused and his father both obtained independent legal advice, after full disclosure of the relevant facts, and waived any conflict.&nbsp; The father also waived solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; The court was satisfied there was no issue of confidential information.&nbsp; On these facts, the court concluded that “public confidence in the criminal justice system might well be undermined by interfering with the accused’s selection of the counsel of his choice” (para.&nbsp;30).</p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In putting together words to describe a “fiduciary” there is of course no immediate obstacle. Almost everybody would say that it is a person in whom trust and confidence is placed by another on whose behalf the fiduciary is to act. The other (the beneficiary) is entitled to expect that the fiduciary will be concerned solely for the beneficiary’s interests, never the fiduciary’s own. The “relationship” must be the dependence or reliance of the beneficiary upon the fiduciary.</p>

The appellant seeks a stay of the <i>Doblanko</i> verdict and a stay of further proceedings in the <i>Canada Trust</i> matters on the basis he was denied his right to effective representation contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s. 11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">d<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, and that further proceedings on these matters would be an abuse of process.&nbsp; So abusive, he says, that this sorry affair amounts to one of the “clearest of cases” where a stay is justified: <i>United States of America v.

Sullivan</i>, 446 U.S. 335 (1980), that, if defence counsel is incompetent or otherwise violates his or her duties in such a way as to adversely affect the representation of an accused, “a serious risk of injustice infects the trial itself. . . . When a State obtains a criminal conviction through such a trial, it is the State that unconstitutionally deprives the defendant of his liberty” (p. 343).&nbsp; See also <i>Mickens v. Taylor</i>, 122 S.&nbsp;Ct. 1237 (2002), at p.&nbsp;1245.&nbsp; We do not need to consider this argument in this case.&nbsp; It is difficult to see how the conduct of a law firm that is not actually engaged as defence counsel, as here, could have such a drastic impact on the constitutionality of the trial.&nbsp; Here there was no wrongful state action.&nbsp; Nor did the conduct of the Venkatraman law firm “infect” the appellant’s trial with “a serious risk of injustice”.&nbsp; Further, with respect to the tertiary ground, there is nothing in the <i>Doblanko</i> verdict to contravene our fundamental notions of justice.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(i)&nbsp; The falsification of court documents came to light without the involvement of the Venkatraman firm.&nbsp; Mr. Doblanko had already obtained from the divorce court the documents incriminating the appellant before he came to see Lazin.&nbsp; Doblanko wished to remarry and both he and the wife he had deserted years previously required that their status be regularized.&nbsp; A court action was inevitable and any judge confronted with court documents possibly falsified by someone holding themselves out as a paralegal could be expected to have the matter reported to the police.&nbsp; Lazin’s involvement in the process was in violation of his and the firm’s professional obligations, but it in truth contributed little to the appellant’s predicament.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(ii)&nbsp; The Venkatraman firm’s involvement ended with the report to the police.&nbsp; At that point, the police conducted their own investigation and laid charges.&nbsp; The “independent investigation and decision by the authorities” to prosecute militates against a finding of abuse of process here: <i>R. v. Finn</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 10, at para.&nbsp;1.</p>

<div class="Section30">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(iii)&nbsp; The appellant acknowledged that any confidential information obtained with respect to the <i>Canada Trust</i> matters or his other files with the Venkatraman law firm had no relevance whatsoever to the <i>Doblanko</i> divorce.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(iv)&nbsp; In light of the tenuous connection between the Venkatraman law firm and the <i>Doblanko</i> prosecution, it simply cannot be said that the lawyers’ violation of their duty of loyalty was an “affront to fair play and decency . . . disproportionate to the societal interest in the effective prosecution of criminal cases [and] the administration of justice”:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Conway</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(v)&nbsp; The charges are extremely serious.&nbsp; Falsification of court documents&nbsp; strikes at the root of the integrity of the court’s process.&nbsp; It would be irrational to deprive the state of the jury’s verdict because of a law firm’s private conduct of which the state had no knowledge and over which it had no influence.</p>

Pearson</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620, at para.&nbsp;15, stay procedures may “lead to a two-stage trial, in which the two stages are autonomous”.&nbsp; The stay was lifted by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; The jury’s verdict was thereby not reversed but activated.&nbsp; For purposes of the right of an appeal to this Court, the reversal of the stay was treated as equivalent to setting aside an acquittal, but only for that limited purpose.&nbsp; Dickson C.J. pointed out in <i>R. v. Jewitt</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at p.&nbsp;148:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">We are concerned here with a stay of proceedings because of an abuse of process by the Crown.&nbsp; While a stay of proceedings of this nature will have the same result as an acquittal and will be such a final determination of the issue that it will sustain a plea of <i>autrefois acquit</i>, its assimilation to an acquittal should only be for purposes of enabling an appeal by the Crown.&nbsp; Otherwise, the two concepts are not equated.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Accordingly the Court of Appeal was correct to remit the <i>Doblanko</i> matter to the trial judge for sentencing.</p>
