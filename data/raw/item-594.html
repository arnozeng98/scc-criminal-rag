(dissenting):&nbsp; The trial judge's charge as a whole makes clear the requirement that the jury direct its attention to the critical question of whether the accused was too intoxicated to be capable of formulating or carrying out a plan to murder.&nbsp; While the trial judge must instruct the jury to consider intoxication with respect to planning and deliberation separately from intoxication with respect to intent, it is not an absolute rule that he must also expressly instruct the jury that a lesser degree of intoxication may suffice to establish incapacity to formulate or carry out a plan to murder than to negative intent to kill.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The degree of drunkenness required to negative capacity to formulate and carry out a plan is a question of fact for the jury.&nbsp; In deciding this question, the jury will take into account the complexity of the plan and the degree of intoxication demonstrated by the evidence.&nbsp; It is evident that the degree of intoxication required to negative capacity to plan and execute a murder may be less than the degree required to negative intent to kill.&nbsp; While it might be useful to instruct the jury explicitly on this point, failure to do so is insufficient to vitiate the charge.&nbsp; The matter is one of fact rather than law and one with which the jury is quite capable of dealing, provided it has been properly instructed on the legal elements as well as the facts.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge's charge, read as a whole, leaves no doubt that the jury were in a position to properly assess the relationship between the appellant's intoxication and his ability to formulate and carry through a plan for murder.&nbsp; Although it would have been better if the trial judge had not used the phrase "very intoxicated" in discussing the capacity to formulate and carry out such a plan, it could not have misled the jury, given the entire charge on this issue.</span></p>

Mitchell</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">, [1964] S.C.R. 471, addressed the matter of how a trial judge should deal with evidence of intoxication on the issues of intent to kill and planning and deliberation.&nbsp; In that case Mitchell was convicted of the capital murder of his brother.&nbsp; There was evidence that on the day of the killing the brothers had been drinking and had argued.&nbsp; Mitchell obtained a gun from a friend, waited for his brother to come out of his house and then shot and killed him.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal for British Columbia ordered a new trial.&nbsp; One of the issues on appeal to this Court was whether the trial judge erred in failing to point out to the jury that deliberation might have been negatived by provocation and drunkenness.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">First, it seems that at one point in the passage quoted from, the trial judge equates an "intentional" act with one that is "carefully thought out" or in other words, planned.&nbsp; Second, the charge on this point seems to be sending mixed messages to the jury.&nbsp; On the one hand the trial judge indicates that intoxication may make it "much less likely" that the appellant planned and deliberated.&nbsp; But on the other hand, the trial judge makes this comment in the context of someone that is "very intoxicated".&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, with respect, the use of the words "very intoxicated" in connection with the effect of drunkenness on planning and deliberation may have misled the jury into believing that a <u>lesser</u> degree of drunkenness than that required to negative the intent to kill could not negative planning and deliberation.&nbsp; If this mistaken impression was left with the jury, then it can hardly be said that the trial judge's charge, absent an explicit instruction, clearly distinguished between the degree of intoxication necessary to negative intent to kill and that necessary to negative planning and deliberation.&nbsp; I agree with Harradence J.A. in dissent, that on the whole the trial judge's charge did not explicitly or sufficiently inform the jury of this distinction.</span></p>
