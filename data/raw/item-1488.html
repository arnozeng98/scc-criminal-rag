24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Sopinka J.:&nbsp; While the breach of the Crown’s obligation to disclose was egregious, a stay is not the only appropriate remedy in the circumstances.&nbsp; Assuming that the trial judge was not <i>functus</i>, one of the circumstances that he did not take into account is the fact that there must be a new trial by reason of the apprehension of bias occasioned by his conduct. &nbsp;The trial judge may be satisfied that full disclosure has been made prior to the commencement of the new trial.&nbsp; While the trial judge proceeded on the basis that, absent a stay, the trial would continue, this Court must decide whether a stay is the only appropriate remedy having regard for the fact that a new trial will otherwise be held.&nbsp; Consequently, it is impossible to say what, if any, prejudice has been caused by the non‑disclosure, or whether full disclosure will have been made prior to the commencement of the new trial.&nbsp; The order directing a new trial should be affirmed.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> McLachlin and Major JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; While as a general rule a judge should not discuss a case with one party outside the other party’s presence, much less suggest to one party in the other’s absence who counsel on the case should be, a conclusion of bias does not flow automatically from breach of this rule.&nbsp; The question is whether the content of the discussion in all the surrounding circumstances supports an inference that the trial judge favoured one party over the other.&nbsp; In this case Crown counsel’s conduct was prejudicing a fair trial and might ultimately have caused the trial to be aborted.&nbsp; While the trial judge should not have stipulated that he be removed, it is questionable whether his doing so indicated partiality to either the Crown or the defence. Moreover, even if the inference could be drawn that the trial judge was biased against the Crown, it does not follow that he automatically lost jurisdiction.&nbsp; Judicial conduct giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias does not automatically deprive the judge of jurisdiction and render all proceedings thereafter void.&nbsp; The proper course for a party affected by the bias is to move promptly for recusal of the judge.&nbsp; Absent an order disqualifying the judge, the judge retains jurisdiction and the proceedings continue as before.&nbsp; While the issue has not often arisen in criminal proceedings, the authorities support the view that bias or apprehension of bias does not automatically render the trial a nullity.&nbsp; This flows from the general principle that a court order must be obeyed until there is an order to the contrary.&nbsp; It follows that the trial judge in the present case retained jurisdiction after the telephone call alleged to give rise to an apprehension of bias against the Crown.&nbsp; This jurisdiction continued through the recusal motion and after its dismissal.&nbsp; The subsequent decisions of the judge were voidable, not void.&nbsp; Moreover, even if the trial judge lost jurisdiction by not recusing himself from the trial, it is open to this Court, in the interest of justice, to examine the circumstances of the proceedings and to enter a stay if that is the result required.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">What occurred in this case was an abuse of process.&nbsp; While the trial judge believed that the non‑disclosed evidence was material to the ability of the accused to make full answer and defence, the entire conduct of the trial has brought the administration of justice into disrepute and in the process violated <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Throughout the proceedings the Crown bent and broke rules, and attempted to cover up when it was caught.&nbsp; The Crown actively misled the court on a number of occasions, and ignored or failed to obey court orders.&nbsp; The conduct of Crown counsel at the trial violates the fundamental principles that underlie the community’s sense of fair play and decency and constitutes an abuse of the court’s process.</span></p>

Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.&nbsp; This memorandum demonstrates an unusual attitude on behalf of Crown counsel that is not compatible with their responsibilities and critical role in our justice system.&nbsp; This evidence eventually was before the trial judge in the stay proceeding.</p>

<div class="Section40">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Having considered these authorities, the law seems clear.&nbsp; I am at a loss to understand why the situation in this case has reached the stage it has; such a state of disarray.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The Crown does not seem to make a clear distinction between what is Crown discretion and what is disclosure.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the Crown has discretion as to the conduct of their case.&nbsp; But it seems that the very principles of fundamental justice would dictate that before charges are laid, the Crown is aware of the evidence it has in hand or has available to it to substantiate those charges.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">When they come to trial, it seems logical that the Crown would have the evidence which it needs for the prosecution of the charges, marshalled and ready for presentation to the court, and thus, available to the defence.&nbsp; The authorities not only speak of evidence, but any material.&nbsp; Many times the court has heard about the multitude of documents, mountain of evidence, and the complexity of the evidence.&nbsp; Now whether this has created a perception which has paralyzed the Crown in organizing the proper evidence for the court, I cannot say.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Another fundamental principle of our criminal justice system is that the defence does not have to do anything.&nbsp; The obligation is on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the allegations in the Indictment.&nbsp; However, in this case, as none before in my experience, defence has gone to great length to seek out documents which they thought must exist in order to make a full answer and defence.&nbsp; There is a particular attitude on behalf of the Crown evidenced by a letter filed by the Crown inadvertently in this application and marked Exhibit 1764.&nbsp; Although part of it was not allowed to be used in cross‑examination of Staff Sergeant MacDonald, there is another part which states, as written by Mr. Felderhof to Mr. Theuerkauf:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

This is very important not only with respect to the presentation before the Judge, but as it may appear to the media.&nbsp; We must be seen as presenting something of little or no significance.&nbsp; My contact to the media subsequent to that will confirm this position.”</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I have now grave concern that this trial as a criminal trial has been lost sight of.&nbsp; The court has heard from a number of sources suggesting that this is the most important criminal trial in Nova Scotia, that it is a very high profile trial, however, it is not prosecuted as such.</p>

Perhaps the most natural inference from the trial judge’s conduct is simply that he was concerned that the trial proceed fairly.</p>

An application may be made to the judge (or other appropriate judicial officer) for the judge’s removal or for such other remedy as may seem just on the basis of the bias or apprehension of bias. If an order is made for removal of the judge, then the judge loses jurisdiction.&nbsp; But absent such an order, the judge continues to exercise jurisdiction over the proceedings.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The contrary view runs counter to the rule of law and the practical functioning of our judicial system.&nbsp; For example, if this view were to hold, parties perceiving bias could lie in the weeds and long after the trial judge rules against them, have the entire proceeding invalidated <i>ab initio</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A party who was not prejudiced by the bias could move to have the proceedings and verdict set aside on the ground of nullity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Persons affected by a court order would look to see whether there is some basis on which the judge’s jurisdiction could be impugned and decide accordingly whether to obey the order or not.&nbsp; Absent verification that the judge in fact was not biased, no one could know for certain whether a court order was worth the paper it was recorded on.&nbsp; Verdicts, including acquittals, and sentences long since imposed could be overturned on the discovery, perhaps years later, of conduct by the trial judge capable of supporting a reasonable apprehension of bias.&nbsp; Finally, if the jurisdiction of the trial judge ended with the event giving rise to an apprehension of bias, it would not be possible to make a motion to the trial judge for recusal since he or she would lack jurisdiction to hear it; the established procedure for remedying bias would be rendered invalid.</p>

In short, the material reveals a search warrant that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should <u>now</u> be set aside.&nbsp; It does not, however, reveal a search warrant that was a nullity, that is, one void from its inception (on the ground of fraud, deliberate deceptive conduct, or no jurisdiction in the sense that a justice had no general power to issue search warrants) and thus not valid at the time of the impugned search.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there is a positive duty on defence counsel to bring any disclosure problems to the attention of the trial Judge at the earliest possible opportunity.&nbsp; Failure to do so may, in certain instances, deprive the accused of a remedy for non‑disclosure.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In our view, counsel for the appellants in this case went above and beyond the call of duty in searching out evidence that had not been disclosed.&nbsp; On several occasions, it was only through defence searches of the Crown’s own files that material information was uncovered.&nbsp; Rather than simply admitting the errors it made during the trial, the Crown has consistently attempted to place blame on others.&nbsp; The Crown gives us no hint that its attitude will change in the future.</p>
