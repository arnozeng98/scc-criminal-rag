 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">By an agreement dated January 15, 1971 Black and Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited, DeWalt Canada Limited and Master Pneumatic Tools (Canada), Ltd. agreed to amalgamate under the name of Black and Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited and on the same date letters patent were issued confirming the amalgamation agreement. On April 5, 1972 an information was sworn charging Black and Decker Manufacturing Company, Limited with two counts of retail price maintenance contrary to the <i>Combines Investigation Act. </i>The offences were alleged to have occurred between October 1966 and August 1970. The accused moved to quash the information or for dismissal on the grounds that no criminal responsibility could be transferred to it with respect to a period prior to the amalgamation. In the Court of Appeal the appellant succeeded in obtaining an Order of Prohibition prohibiting further proceedings on the information; that order is appealed to this Court.</span></p>

On arraignment but prior to entering a plea, the accused moved for an order quashing the information or alternatively directing an acquittal on the ground that the charges being with respect to a period prior to the amalgamation, no criminal responsibility “can be transferred to” the amalgamated company. The Provincial Court Judge dismissed the motion. The accused then moved for an order of prohibition before Fraser J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario who was of the opinion that the point raised went to the merits of the case rather than to jurisdiction and should preferably be disposed of at trial.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Arnup J.A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of a Court, comprising Gale C.J.O., Jessup and Arnup JJ.A., after quoting s. 137, said:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Puzzling questions of great difficulty are raised by this section&nbsp;and particularly from the expressions “continue as one company” (s. 137(1)), “the amalgamating companies are amalgamated and are continued as one company” (s.s.(13)(<i>a</i>)), and the use of the word “possesses” in relation to rights and assets (s.s.(13)(<i>b</i>)), rather than any words indicating a “transfer”. Finally, and in the end this case will turn upon the meaning of this provision, what is meant by the language of s.s. (14) that all <i>liabilities </i>(of the old company) “thenceforth attach to the amalgamated company and may be enforced against it”?</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">then reviewed the authorities, and concluded:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">We are therefore not concerned with whether the old company has disappeared as a separate and distinct entity. What concerns us is whether the new company can be prosecuted for the sins of the old one. The case narrows down in the end to the question whether subsection&nbsp;(13)(<i>b</i>) of s. 137, in making the new company “subject to all the liabilities” of each of the old companies, imposes upon the new company criminal liability of one of the old companies. The word “liabilities” appears not only in clause (<i>b</i>) of s.s. (13) but also in s.s. (14). Leaving aside the rather curious fact that in clause (<i>b</i>) the matters to</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 416]</span></p>
 <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">which the new company is subject are listed as “all the contracts, liabilities, debts and obligations”, whereas s.s. (14) lists these matters as “all debts, contracts, liabilities and duties”, of more significance is the French version of the statute. The words used in clause (<i>b</i>) as the French equivalent of “liabilities” is “engagements”, and the equivalent of “liabilities” in s.s. (14) is given in French as “passifs”. My brother Jessup, whose knowledge and grasp of the French language is much greater than mine, has pointed out to me that both “engagements” and “passifs” are <i>commercial </i>synonyms for the English word “liabilities”. In his view, if a connotation of <i>criminal </i>liability had been intended the French synonym would have been the word “responsabilités”. (For an example, see R.S.C. 1970, 1st. Supp., chap. 19, s. 4.5(6), amending the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act).</span></p>
 <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Furthermore, it seems clear to me from the argument of the Crown that we are being asked to imply a penal sanction upon the new company that has not been spelled out in express terms by Parliament. In my view, we ought not to make any such implication. It is still the law that penal sanctions are to be imposed by express language. “Liabilities”, without more, cannot in my view be interpreted to include “criminal liabilities”, or more accurately, “criminal responsibilities”.</span></p>
 <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of this case. The new company could not be prosecuted for acts committed by the old company. Since the new company was not even in existence during the period covered by the dates in the charge, it cannot possibly be found guilty unless it is liable for acts or omissions of the old company.</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">amalgamating companies. Whether an amalgamation creates or extinguishes a corporate entity will, of course, depend upon the terms of the applicable statute, but as I read the Act, in particular s. 137, and consider the purposes which an amalgamation is intended to serve, it would appear to me that upon an amalgamation under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en" target="_blank">Canada Corporations Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>no “new” company is created and no “old” company is extinguished.

That word means “to remain in existence or in its present condition”—<i>Shorter </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Oxford</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA"> English Dictionary. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">The companies “are amalgamated and are continued as one company” which is the very antithesis of the notion that the amalgamating companies are extinguished or that they continue in a truncated state; (ii) the statement in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en#!fragment/sec137subsec13" target="_blank">s. 137(13)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>b</i>) that the “amalgamated company possesses all the property, rights...” If corporate birth or death were envisaged, one would have expected to find, in the statute, some provision for transfer or conveyance or transmission of assets and not simply the word “possesses”, a word which re-enforces the concept of continuance; (iii) letters patent of amalgamation are obtained for the purpose of “confirming the agreement” (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en#!fragment/sec137subsec11" target="_blank">s. 137(11)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>), in marked contrast to letters patent of incorporation which expressly create a body corporate and politic; (iv) the French version of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en#!fragment/sec137subsec1" target="_blank">s. 137(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, perhaps better than the English version, serves to express what has occurred, “Deux ou plus de deux compagnies…peuvent fusionner et continuer comme une seule et même compagnie”. The effect is that of blending and continuance as one and the selfsame company; (v) the Act contains a number of express provisions whereby the life of corporate creations may be terminated—<i>Videlicet </i>where a company carries on business not within the scope of its objects (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en#!fragment/sec5subsec4" target="_blank">s. 5(4)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>), or forfeits its charter (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en#!fragment/sec31" target="_blank">s. 31<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>), or surrenders its charter (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en#!fragment/sec32" target="_blank">s. 32<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>), or is dissolved (<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en#!fragment/sec133subsec11" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;133(11)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>).

While it may be difficult to comprehend the exact metamorphosis which takes place, it is within the Legislature’s competence to provide that what were hitherto two shall continue as one.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Kelly J.A. compared the language of s. 96 of Ontario Statutes 1953, c. 19, upon which the <i>Stanward </i>case was decided, and that of its predecessor, s. 11 of <i>The Companies Act, </i>R.S.O. 1950, c. 59, upon which <i>Regina v.

The earlier legislation referred to the amalgamated corporation as the “new corporation” and spoke of “the corporation so incorporated”.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The word “amalgamation” is not a legal term and is not susceptible of exact definition: <i>In re South African Supply and Cold Storage Company</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[6]</span></span></span></a>.<i> </i>The word is derived from mercantile usage and denotes, one might say, a legal means of achieving an economic end. The juridical nature of an amalgamation need not be determined by juridical criteria alone, to the exclusion of consideration of the purposes of amalgamation. Provision is made under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1970-c-c-32-en" target="_blank">Canada Corporations Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>and under the Acts of the various provinces whereby two or more companies incorporated under the governing Act may amalgamate and form one corporation. The purpose is economic: to build, to consolidate, perhaps to diversify, existing businesses; so that through union there will be enhanced strength. It is a joining of forces and resources in order to perform better in the economic field. If that be so, it would surely be paradoxical if that process were to involve death by suicide or the mysterious disappearance of those who sought security, strength and, above all, survival in that union. Also, one must recall that the amalgamating companies <i>physically </i>continue to exist in the sense that offices, warehouses, factories, corporate records and correspondence and documents are still there, and business goes on. In a physical sense an amalgamating business or company does not disappear although it may become part of a greater enterprise.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There are various ways in which companies can be put together. The <i>assets </i>of one or more existing companies may be sold to another existing company or to a company newly‑incorporated, in exchange for cash or shares or other consideration. The consideration received may</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 421]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">then be distributed to the shareholders of the companies whose assets have been sold, and these companies wound up and their charters surrendered. In this type of transaction a new company may be incorporated or an old company may be wound up but the legal position is clear. There is no fusion of corporate entities. Another form of merger occurs when an existing company or a newly-incorporated company acquires the <i>shares </i>of one or more existing companies which latter companies may then be retained as subsidiaries or wound up after their assets have been passed up to the parent company. Again there is no fusion. But in an amalgamation a different result is sought and different legal mechanics are adopted, usually for the express purpose of ensuring the continued existence of the constituent companies. The motivating factor may be the <i>Income Tax Act </i>or difficulties likely to arise in conveying assets if the merger were by asset or share purchase. But whatever the motive, the end result is to coalesce to create a homogeneous whole. The analogies of a river formed by the confluence of two streams, or the creation of a single rope through the intertwining of strands have been suggested by others.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Counsel for the accused argued that an amalgamation agreement provides for so many changes (s. 137(3)) and the transformation of the amalgamating companies is so complete as to amount to extinction of life. I do not agree. A company can, by supplementary Letters Patent, make equally drastic changes without affecting, in the slightest, corporate longevity.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It was also submitted that if the amalgamating companies continue in amalgamation, in all their plenitude, then ss. 137(13)(<i>b</i>) and 137(14) are mere surplusage. I would not so regard them. These sections&nbsp;spell out in broad language amplification of a general principle, a not</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 422]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">uncommon practice of legislative draftsmen. If ss. 137(13)(<i>b</i>) and 137(14) are to be read, however, as other than merely supportive of a general principle and other than all-embracing, then some corporate incidents, such as criminal responsibility, must be regarded as severed from the amalgamating companies and outside the amalgamated company. What happens to these vestigial remnants? Are they extinguished and if so, by what authority? Do they continue in a state of ethereal suspension? Such metaphysical abstractions are not, in my view, a necessary concomitant of the legislation. The effect of the statute, on a proper construction, is to have the amalgamating companies continue without subtraction in the amalgamated company, with all their strengths and their weaknesses, their perfections and imperfections, and their sins, if sinners they be. Letters patent of amalgamation do not give absolution.</span></p>
