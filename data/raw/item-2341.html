It was only after undergoing hypnosis at the request of police investigators that G stated that she had seen T on Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp; Several of H’s friends also testified at trial that T was a jealous and obsessive partner who could not tolerate the thought of her leaving him.&nbsp; A former girlfriend, O, testified that following T’s breakup with her two years earlier, he returned to her apartment and banged on the door, demanding to be allowed entry, but that she did not open the door.&nbsp; T, who testified in his own defence, claimed that it was he who had ended the relationship with H that night and that when he left H’s apartment at 12:30&nbsp;a.m., she was still alive.&nbsp; He denied going back to her apartment on Wednesday, but admitted returning to the apartment building on that day to retrieve his car from the parking garage.&nbsp; To support his claim, T adduced evidence that he was at work at the time G claimed to have seen him leaving H’s apartment on Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp; </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The approach to hypnotically refreshed evidence as novel science raises concerns not only with respect to the views on the admissibility of such evidence, but also with respect to the implications for the admissibility of scientific evidence in future cases.&nbsp; First, characterizing hypnosis as novel science ignores the fact that the technique has been used in Canada for almost 30&nbsp;years, and has been&nbsp; employed in Canadian criminal investigations to assist in memory retrieval for a similar length of time.&nbsp; While the use of forensic hypnosis has not been assessed under the framework to determine admissibility of novel scientific evidence, this does not mean that evidence derived from this technique has been admitted into trials without sufficient scrutiny of its reliability.&nbsp; Very few Canadian courts have admitted hypnosis evidence without a <i>voir dire</i> as to its admissibility.&nbsp; Second, the test for assessing the reliability of scientific evidence is&nbsp; not new law requiring that scientific methods, previously accepted as legitimate by our courts, must now be resubmitted for scrutiny.&nbsp; Rather, the test emphasizes the need for courts to give special scrutiny to novel science or the new application of a recognized science, through a case‑by‑case evaluation, in light of the changing nature of our scientific knowledge.&nbsp; The test was not intended to set down a rigid formula where the results must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before scientific evidence can be admitted.&nbsp; The factors adopted&nbsp; were designed to be flexible and non‑exclusive.&nbsp; Third, the test was not meant to require a standard of total consensus by members of the scientific community.&nbsp; Total unanimity, which is a standard akin to the “general acceptance” test recently rejected by this Court, is impossible to obtain and therefore completely unrealistic to expect.&nbsp; To require such a high standard of reliability will result in the exclusion of far too much relevant and probative evidence.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; it is especially problematic to adopt a general exclusionary rule towards hypnosis evidence by relying almost exclusively on the position of experts discussed in American cases cited.&nbsp; To rely on expert evidence heard in other cases deprives a party of the right to present contrary evidence or to cross‑examine the experts who maintain such a position.&nbsp; A court should never take judicial notice of expert evidence.&nbsp; [115] [131‑132] [134] [136] [138‑144]</span></p>

As this Court has previously noted, “[t]he names of Marshall, Milgaard, Morin, Sophonow and Parsons signal prudence and caution in a murder case”: <i>United States v. Burns</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, 2001 SCC 7, at para. 1. In the case at bar, we consider once again the need to carefully scrutinize evidence presented against an accused for reliability and prejudicial effect, and to ensure the basic fairness of the criminal process. More specifically, the decisions at trial to admit post-hypnosis evidence and similar fact evidence in this case constitute errors of law that are neither harmless nor negligible. This is not a case where the remaining evidence is so overwhelming that I can conclude that a conviction would inevitably have been entered by the trier of fact had the evidence in issue not been adduced. I would set aside the conviction and order a new trial.</p>

I will therefore begin with a general overview of the facts and of the decisions of the courts below, and will go into greater detail on the two grounds that are, in my view, determinative of the outcome of this appeal.</p>

The Crown’s theory at trial was that the appellant had killed Ms. Hunter in a fit of rage after she had attempted to end their troubled relationship. Several of Ms. Hunter’s friends testified that the appellant was a jealous and obsessive partner who could not tolerate the thought of her leaving him. However, the appellant, who testified in his own defence, claimed that it was he who had ended the relationship that night and that when he left Ms. Hunter’s apartment at 12:30 a.m., she was still alive.</p>

Although she did not see the man, Ms. Haghnegahdar heard the door eventually open to admit him. Given the estimated time of death, it was likely that the man who entered the apartment at that time was Ms. Hunter’s killer.&nbsp; Establishing that it was the appellant knocking at the door was a key aspect of the Crown’s case. To this end, the Crown was permitted to adduce evidence that following Mr. Trochym’s breakup with a previous girlfriend (Darlene Oliphant) two years earlier, he had returned to her apartment and banged on the door, demanding to be let in.</p>

This testimony was considered critical by the Crown and was characterized as significant by the trial judge.&nbsp; The Crown sought to use it to establish that Mr.&nbsp;Trochym had returned to Ms. Hunter’s apartment in the afternoon after the murder to “stage the scene” of the crime. By removing some personal effects and moving the body to make it appear as though the murder had been sexually motivated, the Crown argued, the appellant sought to distract attention from himself. The Crown’s theory was supported by forensic evidence that established that the deceased had been killed in the early hours of Wednesday morning, but that her body had been repositioned some eight to twelve hours after the murder.</p>

To support his claim, Mr. Trochym adduced evidence that he was at work at the time the witness claimed to have seen him leaving the deceased’s apartment on Wednesday afternoon. The Crown argued that the appellant’s evidence on this point was concocted and further argued that the appellant’s demeanour in the days subsequent to the discovery of the deceased’s body was evidence of consciousness of guilt. When asked to attend a second meeting with the police, the appellant had made excuses not to attend, claiming that he was otherwise occupied with a darts game and a haircut appointment. Mr. Trochym testified at trial that he had been attempting to “stall” until he could consult with counsel, but the Crown suggested to the jury that the appellant’s post-offence conduct established that the appellant had lied when he claimed he wanted to help officers with their investigation, and that this was evidence of consciousness of guilt, because the appellant was evading police. Although this evidence was admitted, the trial judge instructed the jury that it “would be completely wrong to draw any adverse inference against the [appellant] from his desire to stall for time because he wanted to consult with a lawyer” (A.R., at p. 3736).</p>

The Ontario Court of Appeal declined to find that the trial judge had erred in allowing this evidence, and dismissed the appeal. MacPherson J.A., writing for the court, also rejected a number of other grounds of appeal that have been raised again before this Court. More specifically, he held that the trial judge had not erred in dealing with the appellant’s post-offence conduct, or with the Crown’s assertion that the appellant had concocted evidence to show that he could not be the person who had staged the crime scene. Nor, MacPherson J.A. held, had the Crown’s cross-examination of the appellant rendered the trial unfair.</p>

He also requests the Court to exclude the similar fact evidence.&nbsp; The Crown submits that none of the grounds of appeal warrant intervention and that the appeal should be dismissed. In the event that the trial judge erred, the Crown argues, this Court should apply the curative proviso of s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

At that time, Ms.&nbsp;Haghnegahdar told police officers that she had seen Mr. Trochym come out of Ms.&nbsp;Hunter’s apartment on the afternoon of Thursday, October 15. When police investigators interviewed the appellant, he claimed that the last time he had been in the apartment was in the early morning hours of Wednesday, October 14, but that he had returned to the building on Wednesday afternoon to retrieve his car. The building superintendent confirmed that he had spoken with the appellant on Wednesday afternoon and had let him into the underground garage. Another neighbour, Phyllis Humenick, also stated that she had seen Mr. Trochym in the building on Wednesday afternoon.

She related this sighting to the fact that her daughter had had a piano lesson, and that the piano lessons were on Wednesdays. During a post-hypnosis interview with the police, Ms. Haghnegahdar adopted these memories, stating that she must have seen the appellant on Wednesday afternoon. Ms. Haghnegahdar also provided further detail about the jacket the accused was wearing when she saw him, saying that it was a leather jacket or a windbreaker. In the hypnosis session, the hypnotist had asked the following question about the jacket the man was wearing: “Is it a sports jacket or windbreaker [or] what?”</p>

On April 5, 1995, after a lengthy <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i> at which the evidence of three expert witnesses was considered, the trial judge held that the post-hypnosis evidence was admissible and that it would be for the jury to determine the weight it was to be given. In particular, the trial judge found that the hypnotist, Dr. Matheson, had substantially complied with the guidelines set out by the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench in <i>R. v. Clark </i>(1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 117, which had been adopted in a number of Ontario decisions. In summarizing the expert testimony, the trial judge noted that hypnosis may increase the number of details recalled, but that the “recovered memories” may or may not be accurate (A.R., at p. 30). Rather than excluding the post-hypnosis evidence, the trial judge observed, where the evidence sought to be introduced is from a witness other than the accused, “it is necessary for the Court to embark upon the process of weighing the probative value of the evidence against the potential for prejudice, but always with the presumption being in favour of admissibility subject to weight” (A.R., at p. 25).</p>

The trial judge accepted this agreement and the jurors were thus unaware that Ms. Haghnegahdar had been hypnotized, that her recollection had changed and that there had been some disagreement among the expert witnesses regarding the reliability of post-hypnosis memories.</p>

The Court’s framework for assessing novel science ensures that only scientific opinions based on a reliable foundation are put to the trier of fact (<i>J.-L.J.</i>, at para. 33), and the same principle applies to scientific techniques. Just as financial results contained in a report must be found to be prepared on the basis of a technique that has a reliable scientific foundation, post-hypnosis memories must be demonstrated to be sufficiently reliable before being put to the trier of fact.&nbsp; The “gatekeeper function” of the courts referred to in <i>J.-L.J.</i> (at para. 1) is thus as important when facts extracted through the use of a scientific technique are put to the jury as when an opinion is put to the jury through an expert who bases his or her conclusions on a scientific technique. As I will explain, the trial judge’s error was to assume that post-hypnosis evidence is admissible provided that the <i>Clark</i> guidelines are followed.&nbsp; This is an error, both because the <i>Clark </i>guidelines themselves are insufficient and because post-hypnosis evidence does not meet the requirements of <i>J.-L.J.</i>&nbsp; I will consider both these points in turn.</p>

In that case, the accused was charged with two counts of first degree murder. He had no memory of the events until he was hypnotized. While there was no dispute that the accused had committed the acts with which he was charged, the issue at trial was his intent and mental capacity at the relevant time. Wachowich J. noted concerns regarding the use of hypnosis, but concluded that it would only be in an “extraordinary case” that a court would preclude a witness from testifying after having his or her memory stimulated by hypnosis (p. 123). However, he held that “the content of the hypnosis session is a proper subject for inquiry at the trial because it bears heavily on the credibility of the witness and the weight to be given his evidence” (p. 124). To this end, Wachowich J. set out a number of principles that should guide a hypnotist during a hypnosis session. These guidelines, he observed, would improve the reliability of evidence obtained under hypnosis.</p>

While they play an important role in limiting the possible exertion of influence during a hypnosis session, the guidelines are problematic in that they are based on an assumption that the underlying science of hypnosis is itself reliable in the context of judicial proceedings. Reliability is an essential component of admissibility. Whereas the degree of reliability required by courts may vary depending on the circumstances, evidence that is not sufficiently reliable is likely to undermine the fundamental fairness of the criminal process.</p>

Dr.&nbsp;Orne subsequently warned that “hypnotically induced memories should <i>never</i> be permitted to form the basis for testimony by witnesses or victims in a court of law”: <i>Burral v. State</i>,<i> </i>724 A.2d 65 (Md. 1999), at p. 81 (emphasis in original). He was of the view that “there is a considerable risk that the inherent unreliability of information confidently provided by a hypnotized witness may actually be detrimental to the truth-seeking process” (<i>State v. Moore</i>, 902 A.2d 1212 (N.J. 2006), at p. 1228). After reconsidering the inherent unreliability of post-hypnosis testimony, New Jersey joined the 26 states in the United States that limit the admissibility of post-hypnosis testimony.&nbsp; In New Jersey, post-hypnosis testimony is now generally inadmissible in a criminal trial (<i>Moore</i>, at p. 1213).</p>

Terceira</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 866.&nbsp; An example of the second situation, where a technique that has been employed for some time comes to be questioned, is so-called “dock”, or in-court, identification evidence.&nbsp; In <i>R. v.

This is particularly important where, as here, an accused person’s liberty is at stake. Even though the use of expert testimony was not in itself at issue in the present case — this appeal concerns the application of a scientific technique to the testimony of a lay witness — the threshold reliability of the technique, and its impact on the testimony, remains crucial to the fairness of the trial.</p>

As Binnie J. observed, techniques that are sufficiently reliable for therapeutic purposes are not necessarily sufficiently reliable for use as evidence in a court of law where an accused’s liberty is at stake (para. 35). Ironically, it appears that one of the very characteristics that make the use of hypnosis reliable in a therapeutic context — the fact that both mental and physical perceptions are highly malleable under hypnosis — is a source of concern where hypnosis is used for evidentiary purposes and accordingly renders its use for forensic purposes suspect.</p>

What is apparent from these sources is that the accuracy and effect of hypnosis are difficult to assess. While some laboratory studies suggest that hypnosis is not particularly effective in increasing the accuracy of memories, this may be a result of the laboratory setting itself. As Dr.&nbsp;Matheson, the Crown’s expert, explained, what makes memories memorable are the emotional associations that give them meaning. Laboratory studies are largely abstract, and lack the emotional quality or meaning that normally attaches to “real life” memories (A.R., at pp. 559-60).&nbsp; The findings of laboratory studies may not, therefore, be particularly applicable to the area of forensic hypnosis. However, it is significant that, despite their disagreement on other issues, all the experts in this case testified that while hypnosis can result in the subject’s remembering a larger number of details, these will include both accurate and inaccurate information.</p>

What is in issue is its use for forensic purposes. While testifying at trial, the experts referred to a number of scientific articles and studies on hypnosis and memory. Moreover, legal commentators have discussed hypnosis extensively. Since it is the reliability of the technique in the judicial context that is in issue, these resources are useful for our purposes. Even the most superficial examination of these commentaries reveals that much of the substance of the testimonies of the experts heard at trial is supported by the abundant discussions found in the legal literature. The question whether the technique has been subjected to peer review and publication can thus be answered in the affirmative. Dr. Matheson cited the following study while testifying at trial in this case: Council on Scientific Affairs, “Scientific Status of Refreshing Recollection by the Use of Hypnosis” (1985), 253 <i>J.A.M.A.</i> 1918. It is also notable that many of Dr. Orne’s publications have been cited by the courts, including the following: M. T. Orne, “The Use and Misuse of Hypnosis in Court” (1979), 27 <i>Int.’l J. Clinical &amp; Experimental Hypnosis </i>311; M. T. Orne et al., “Hypnotically Refreshed Testimony: Enhanced Memory or Tampering with Evidence?” in <i>Issues and Practices in Criminal Justice</i> (January 1985), at pp.&nbsp; 5-27.&nbsp; Legal commentaries on the use of hypnosis in criminal trials have proliferated: B. L. Diamond, “Inherent Problems in the Use of Pretrial Hypnosis on a Prospective Witness” (1980), 68 <i>Cal. L. Rev. </i>313; T. M. Fleming, “Admissibility of Hypnotically Refreshed or Enhanced Testimony”, 77 A.L.R.4th 927 (1990 &amp; Supp. 2006); G. M.

In sum, while it is not generally accepted that hypnosis <i>always</i> produces unreliable memories, neither is it clear when hypnosis results in <i>pseudo-memories</i> or how a witness, scientist or trier of fact might distinguish between fabricated and accurate memories.</p>

The general consensus appears to be that memory does not work like a tape recorder that can be played back but, rather, is constructive or additive. Remembering may therefore be a more creative mental process than it is usually understood to be. Given these gaps in scientific knowledge, the admission of post-hypnosis memories raises a number of concerns.&nbsp; The Crown’s expert, Dr. Matheson, testified that “the general understanding is that if properly and professionally done you would probably get more information [through hypnosis], and that information will be a combination of accurate and inaccurate [information]” (A.R., at pp. 601-2).</p>

The first, and most significant, of these is the risk of confabulation, or the creation of hallucinated or false memories. Confabulation can result from the power of express or implied suggestions, or simply from a strong, unconscious desire to compensate for a lack of actual memory. It may also result from other causes that are unknown, because scientists know very little about memory. All three expert witnesses noted at trial that, while confabulation may also occur without hypnosis, a person’s suggestibility is enhanced under hypnosis.</p>

As Dr. Pollock, one of two expert witnesses called by the defence, explained, a person who has a memory in the normal “waking state” will examine it and decide whether it is accurate and should be reported. A hypnotized person is more likely to report whatever comes to his or her mind. As a result, while hypnosis may help a witness recall an event in greater detail, this heightened recollection may simply contain both more correct and more false details. The greater number of <i>details</i> the witness remembers may therefore create the illusion that his or her memory has improved in <i>accuracy</i>.</p>

This process is undetectable and seemingly irreversible. When combined with the possibility that memories have been tainted through confabulation, improperly phrased questions, or other unintentional influences, the danger that the accused will be denied a fair hearing becomes obvious.</p>

In admitting Ms. Haghnegahdar’s post-hypnosis memories, the trial judge noted that if judge-made guidelines such as those set out in <i>Clark</i> can control any tainting that might occur during hypnosis, then post-hypnosis memories are no more, or less, accurate than ordinary eyewitness testimony.</p>

Furthermore, the frailties of human memory when unaffected by hypnosis are only just starting to become known; indeed, the fallibility of eyewitness identification has been a central concern in a number of inquiries into wrongful convictions. In his public inquiry into the wrongful conviction of Thomas Sophonow, for example, the Honourable Peter deC. Cory observed that most triers of fact have implicit faith in eyewitness identification and that this can be hazardous. He recommended, among other things, instructing the jury about the shortcomings of eyewitness identification and cautioning it that the vast majority of wrongful convictions have resulted from faulty eyewitness identification: <i>The Inquiry Regarding Thomas Sophonow: The Investigation, Prosecution and Consideration of Entitlement to Compensation</i> (2001), at pp. 33-34. While Justice Cory was specifically addressing ordinary memory, his recommendations make it all the more clear why a technique used to <i>enhance</i> memory must be approached with great caution.</p>

This has resulted in some debate, in the courts of a number of jurisdictions, regarding the admissibility of post-hypnosis memories. In the United Kingdom, for example, post-hypnosis testimony has not been categorically excluded, although evidence of a witness who has been hypnotized can be excluded under s. 78 of the <i>Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</i> (U.K.), 1984, c. 60, on the basis that it would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. For this reason, the Crown Prosecution Service warns Crown counsel to “advise the police to restrict the use of hypnotism to people who may be able to give them a lead on an investigation but who will not be called as witnesses” (“Hypnosis:&nbsp; Guidance — Hypnosis Of A Witness” (online)).&nbsp; In New Zealand and Australia, courts have permitted the admission of post-hypnosis evidence where certain safeguards have been met, resulting in such evidence being declared inadmissible in several instances: see <i>R. v. McFelin</i>, [1985] 2 N.Z.L.R. 750 (C.A.); <i>R. v. G.</i>, [1996] 1 N.Z.L.R. 615 (H.C.); and <i>R. v. Haywood </i>(1994), 73 A. Crim. R. 41 (S.C. Tasmania). Generally speaking, however, there has been very little discussion on the admissibility of post-hypnosis evidence in any of these three jurisdictions.</p>

Two trends have developed. According to the first, the fact that a witness has been hypnotized goes to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility. In <i>Harding v. State</i>, 246 A.2d 302 (1968), the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland held that the fact that only some of the victim’s testimony was based on post-hypnosis recollections went to its probative value. As the psychology of memory has become better understood, however, some courts have developed a number of safeguards to guide the manner in which hypnosis sessions are conducted. This more rigorous framework is typified by <i>Hurd</i>, a decision that, as already mentioned, was one of the main sources of the <i>Clark</i> guidelines. Although setting a more rigorous standard than in <i>Harding</i>, the <i>Hurd</i> guidelines are typical of the approach under which admissibility is subject to the weight to be attached to the particular witness’s post-hypnosis testimony.</p>

Shirley</i>, 723 P.2d 1354 (1982), the California Supreme Court held that the testimony of a witness who has undergone hypnosis to restore his or her memory of events is inadmissible “as to all matters relating to those events, from the time of the hypnosis session forward” (p. 1384). This means that a witness who has been hypnotized to restore his or her memory of an incident may not testify in relation to that incident, regardless of whether he or she made pre-hypnosis statements about it that would otherwise have been admissible.&nbsp; At least half of American jurisdictions now limit the admissibility of post-hypnosis evidence: <i>Moore</i>, at pp. 1220-22.</p>

A further development in the American jurisprudence is also worth noting. In <i>Rock v. Arkansas</i>, 483 U.S. 44 (1987), the United States Supreme Court considered whether an accused’s “right to testify” may be restricted by a state rule that excludes his or her post-hypnosis testimony. In a 5-4 decision, the majority of the court emphasized the constitutional underpinnings of the accused’s right to testify on his or her own behalf. The court observed that an absolute prohibition against the admission of a defendant’s hypnotically refreshed testimony “on the ground that such testimony is always unreliable” operates “to the detriment of any defendant who undergoes hypnosis, without regard to the reasons for it, the circumstances under which it took place, or any independent verification of the information it produced” (p. 56). The court concluded that the State had not demonstrated that the exclusion “of <i>all</i> of a defendant’s testimony that the defendant is unable to prove to be the product of prehypnosis memory” was justified, and that “[w]holesale inadmissibility of a defendant’s testimony is an arbitrary restriction on the right to testify in the absence of clear evidence by the State repudiating the validity of all posthypnosis recollections” (p. 61 (emphasis in original)). The court chose not to comment on the constitutionality of prohibitions on post-hypnosis testimony by a defence witness, as opposed to the accused him or herself.</p>

For this reason, a judge should, in exercising his or her role as “gatekeeper”, carefully scrutinize the admissibility of novel scientific evidence. While parties must be able to put forward the most complete evidentiary record possible (<i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577), admissibility will necessarily be circumscribed where the evidence may “distort the fact-finding process” (<i>J.-L.J.</i>, at para. 29). These concerns are highly relevant where hypnosis is used, because of the controversy surrounding the forensic use of the technique and the need to explain its shortcomings if it is in fact to be used.</p>

Although hypnosis has been the subject of numerous studies, these studies are either inconclusive or draw attention to the fact that hypnosis can, in certain circumstances, result in the distortion of memory. Perhaps most troubling is the potential rate of error in the additional information obtained through hypnosis when it is used for forensic purposes. At the present time, there is no way of knowing whether such information will be accurate or inaccurate.&nbsp; Such uncertainty is unacceptable in a court of law.&nbsp; Furthermore, while the <i>Clark</i> guidelines aid significantly in ensuring that the hypnotist and police make as few involuntary suggestions as possible, they afford no protection against external sources of influence or against the other problems associated with hypnosis, such as confabulation out of a desire to compensate for a lack of actual memory, an increase in detail without sufficient assurances that this new information will be accurate, and memory hardening.</p>

As Proulx J.A. noted in <i>Taillefer</i>, at p. 19, footnote 1, citing a 1984 article in the <i>Revue du Barreau</i>, a witness’s unconscious desire to please can itself exert a subtle pressure on the witness under hypnosis:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">[<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>]&nbsp; These persons, who are very motivated, generally want to help in the investigation. They have been questioned, often several times, without the desired information having been obtained. Only when faced with an impasse is hypnosis used. From the outset, these witnesses and victims have a good idea of what the police expect from them and what they should remember. They will be more attentive to any indication, or sign, which could pop up during their interaction with the person performing the hypnosis. If, in addition, the hypnotized person believes that everything that will be said under hypnosis is reliable (a belief shared by certain professionals and a large part of the public) then everything is in place for confabulation and the creation of pseudo-memory.</p>

For example, in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Baltovich </i>(2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), the officer who drove the witness to the hypnotist’s office may have had a copy of the <i>Toronto Sun</i> on the seat of his cruiser. The front page of that edition had a large photo of the accused and identified him as the prime suspect in the murder. During the hypnosis session, the witness described the accused. This case illustrates that the risks of tainting do not start with the hypnosis session and that the actual reliability is therefore difficult to establish.</p>

Dr. Matheson appeared to agree that the goal of <i>Clark</i> may be unattainable in stating that “in the real world of doing this work you can’t totally avoid contamination. You can’t avoid possible contact with other witnesses, the media, or police, or conversations with neighbours, and things like that” (A.R., at p. 557).</p>

Experts appear to agree that neither the experts nor the individuals who have undergone hypnosis can distinguish confabulated memories from true memories. This is problematic for counsel cross‑examining the witness at trial, since it will be impossible to challenge the witness on the veracity of his or her memory, except insofar as a post-hypnosis memory is inconsistent with a pre‑hypnosis statement.</p>

However, if evidence whose reliability cannot really be tested is admitted and relied upon simply because it is consistent with other admissible evidence, the danger is that a web of consistent but unreliable evidence will lead to a (potentially wrongful) conviction. As a result, given our current understanding of hypnosis, the admission of post-hypnosis memories may render the right of cross‑examination illusory, thereby undermining a key aspect of the adversarial process.</p>

However, if the judge considers that the evidence is so important that it has to be put to the jurors despite its potential shortcomings, those shortcomings have to be mentioned.&nbsp; The judge must then give proper instructions to the jury concerning the effect of hypnosis on the weight of the testimony. The rationale for requiring specific instructions even though a topic was not touched on in the session is that the impact of hypnosis on testimony is not limited to post-hypnosis recollection and that testimony on the topic in question is accordingly likely to affect the jury’s assessment of the witness’s testimony.</p>

In my view, it would be inconsistent with the inadmissibility rule to allow those parts of the testimony, since they are tainted by the inherent shortcomings of the technique of hypnosis. Moreover, it would seem risky to take it for granted that the testimony at trial will be limited to pre-hypnosis memories.&nbsp; Indeed, the possibility that examination or cross-examination at trial will prompt answers more detailed than the recorded pre-hypnosis memories should not be underestimated.&nbsp; For example, let us assume that an accident victim tells police that, although she is not sure, she thinks it was a red car that hit her late at night. In an attempt to attain greater certainty, the police arrange for the victim to undergo hypnosis, and while hypnotized, she confirms that the car was red. At trial, a lawyer explores the matter further and she adds the make, model and year of the vehicle. It would in such a case be impossible to know whether the additional details were related to pre- or post-hypnosis recollection, and therefore whether they were accurate or inaccurate. Thus, in addition to concerns about memory hardening and the impairment of cross-examination, there is also the possibility that a witness will recall additional details whose accuracy is suspect.</p>

It will not cease to be tainted merely because it is consistent with a pre-hypnosis statement.&nbsp; Indeed, as Professor Shaw states (at p. 76), “Determining the extent of the witness’s prehypnotic recollection as well as the extent to which memory hardening has occurred may be difficult to ascertain with precision.” Given the present understanding of memory, the risk of triers of fact being exposed to inadmissible statements appears to me to be too high to consider sidestepping the rule.</p>

MacPherson J.A. held that this decision was entitled to considerable deference and that, although the trial judge did not have the benefit of this Court’s decisions in <i>R. v.

Finally, MacPherson J.A. expressed the view that, although Crown counsel had strayed to some extent in his closing address from the limited purpose for which the evidence had been admitted, the trial judge had corrected these transgressions by reinforcing, in his “clear and accurate charge”, the use to which the evidence could be put: to establish the identity of the person who had knocked on the door, but <i>not</i> to draw the inference that the appellant was a person of bad character and thus more likely to have committed the murder (para. 48).</p>

(C.R.)</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 735, it was established that where the Crown seeks to adduce evidence of a morally repugnant act committed by an accused, the probative value of the evidence must be high enough to outweigh its potential prejudicial effect. Cory J. stated the following in <i>Arp</i>, at para. 48:</p>

Or, to put it another way, specifically it is evidence that the Oliphant relationship can show a <u>pattern of violent behaviour</u> engaged in by the accused when rejected by a girlfriend following a serious relationship” (Court of Appeal reasons, at para. 44 (emphasis added)). With respect, it would be rare for a single incident to evidence a “pattern”.&nbsp; A pattern is observed only if it is assumed that it was in fact the appellant who banged on the deceased’s door the night of the murder. Moreover, banging on a door cannot be characterized as “distinct” or “unique” conduct that is somehow identifiable with a particular accused. The fact that the accused had in the past knocked on an ex-girlfriend’s door can hardly be said to support the inference that he was the person who knocked on the door in this instance. On the identity issue, this evidence had little, if any, probative value.</p>

Crown counsel referred to Darlene Oliphant’s evidence in his closing statement. Noting that Ms. Oliphant, unlike the deceased, was “wise and chose not to open her door and let the accused in” when he banged on her door, Crown counsel made the following comment:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This comment strayed far from the purpose for which Ms. Oliphant’s evidence had been introduced. The Crown’s speculation regarding the possible outcome had Ms. Oliphant opened the door to Mr. Trochym was both highly prejudicial to the appellant and of doubtful relevance to his prosecution for the murder of Donna Hunter. The Crown’s comment cannot be said to go to identifying the accused as the person who had knocked on the door.</p>

The fact that the appellant had, on one previous occasion, banged on a girlfriend’s door after their relationship ended is not sufficiently probative to outweigh the potential prejudicial effect of admitting that evidence for the purpose of identifying him as the killer.

These included adverse inferences the Crown sought to adduce from the appellant’s post-offence conduct, the treatment of the “alibi”, the manner in which Crown counsel cross-examined the appellant, and comments made by Crown counsel in his closing comments to the jury.&nbsp; In view of my finding that the admission of the post-hypnosis testimony and similar fact evidence constituted serious errors of law, it is not necessary to address these concerns other than by recalling Rand J.’s warning in <i>Boucher v. The Queen</i>, [1955] S.C.R. 16, at pp. 23-24:</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">It cannot be over‑emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Crown counsel are expected to present, fully and diligently, all the material facts that have evidentiary value, as well as all the proper inferences that may reasonably be drawn from those facts. However, it is not the Crown’s function “to persuade a jury to convict other than by reason”: <i>R. v. Proctor</i> (1992), 11 C.R. (4th) 200 (Man. C.A.), at para. 59. Rhetorical techniques that distort the fact-finding process, and misleading and highly prejudicial statements, have no place in a criminal prosecution.</p>

The first category is that of so‑called ‘harmless errors’, or errors of a minor nature having no impact on the verdict. The second category encompasses serious errors which would justify a new trial, but for the fact that the evidence adduced was seen as so overwhelming that the reviewing court concludes that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.”&nbsp; With respect to serious errors, Arbour J. (at para. 31) cited Sopinka J. in <i>R. v. S. (P.L.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 916, in support of the proposition that the proviso is applicable only if “the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict. In such circumstances, depriving the accused of a proper trial is justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable result would be another conviction.”</p>

This standard should not be equated with the ordinary standard in a criminal trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The application of the proviso to serious errors reflects a higher standard appropriate to appellate review. The standard applied by an appellate court, namely that the evidence against an accused is so overwhelming that conviction is inevitable or would invariably result, is a substantially higher one than the requirement that the Crown prove its case “beyond a reasonable doubt” at trial.&nbsp; This higher standard reflects the fact that it is difficult for an appellate court, in particular when considering&nbsp; a jury trial, since no detailed findings of fact will have been made, to consider retroactively the effect that, for example, excluding certain evidence could reasonably have had on the outcome.</p>

The post-hypnosis evidence, considered critical by the Crown and characterized as significant by the judge, has to be excluded. The similar fact evidence must also be excluded.

L. (D.O.)</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, at pp. 454-55.&nbsp; When weighing probative value against prejudicial effect, this must be kept in mind.&nbsp; It must be recalled that “prejudicial effect” is the likelihood that the jury, even if properly instructed, will use the evidence for an improper purpose; it is not created merely by evidence that is unfavourable to a party’s case: H.&nbsp;Stewart, <i>Evidence: A Canadian Casebook</i> (2002), at p. 128.&nbsp;</p>

Q.B.)), though these were fairly trivial.&nbsp; First, Dr. Pollock noted that the information concerning the case given to Dr. Matheson was not in writing as required by guideline 3, but instead was oral and was videotaped.&nbsp; However, he admitted on cross-examination that they still fulfilled the purpose intended by the guidelines, that is, to monitor and minimize the risk of inadvertently conveying information to the hypnotist.&nbsp; Second, both Dr. Pollock and Dr.&nbsp;Yarmey suggested that Dr. Matheson may have unintentionally assumed that Ms.&nbsp;Haghnegahdar was recovering memory by linking events together when it was possible that she was not, and this may have influenced her.&nbsp; The trial judge found, however, in the context of the session as a whole that Dr. Matheson’s assumption did not seem unreasonable or suggestive (see A.R., at pp.&nbsp; 775-79; see also, Ruling re Hypnosis, April&nbsp;5, 1995, at p. 6).</p>

I agree.&nbsp; The question is how this process is to be undertaken and what is its object. One important question is the determination of the basis for the new query.&nbsp; As always, context is important.&nbsp; It is important to note, with regard to this, that very few Canadian courts have admitted hypnosis evidence without a <i>voir dire</i> as to its admissibility.&nbsp; This is contrary to some U.S. states that have adopted a <i>per se</i> admissibility rule (i.e., admission without a <i>voir dire</i>): see<i> State v. Brown</i>, 337 N.W.2d 138 (N.D. 1983); <i>State v. Jorgensen</i>, 492 P.2d 312 (Or. Ct. App. 1971); <i>State v. Glebock</i>, 616 S.W.2d 897 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1981); and&nbsp; <i>Prime v. State</i>, 767 P.2d 149 (Wyo. 1989).&nbsp; This illustrates the difficulty in applying foreign precedents without paying attention to differences in approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Canada, the trend has always been to hold a <i>voir dire</i> examining the entire factual context surrounding the hypnosis evidence, with experts called to discuss the science of hypnosis and give their opinion as to whether the evidence in issue is sufficiently reliable to be admitted.&nbsp; See, for example: <i>R. v. Zubot</i> (1981), 47 A.R. 389 (Q.B.); <i>Clark</i>; <i>R. v. Hart</i>, [1990] O.J. No. 2678 (QL) (H.C.J.); <i>R. v. Sanchez-Flores</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 4161 (QL) (Gen. Div.); <i>R. v.

(3d) 481 (C.A.).&nbsp; I fail to see how this is not “judicial assessment” of forensic hypnosis evidence.&nbsp; Clearly, the use of hypnosis evidence has been put to judicial scrutiny.</p>

12.2pt">Judicial notice dispenses with the need for proof of facts that are clearly uncontroversial or beyond reasonable dispute. Facts judicially noticed are not proved by evidence under oath. Nor are they tested by cross‑examination. Therefore, the threshold for judicial notice is strict: a court may properly take judicial notice of facts that are either: (1) so notorious or generally accepted as not to be the subject of debate among reasonable persons; or (2) capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy: <i>R. v. Potts</i> (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 219 (Ont. C.A.); J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 1999), at p. 1055.</p>

This ignores the danger that experts are often chosen to support the position of the party presenting them.&nbsp; T. M.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">There are many problems for the administration of justice associated with the selection of experts and the use of expert testimony by opposing counsel in an adversarial setting.&nbsp; The problems may be grouped into two categories: substantive issues of justice and fairness, and procedural issues related to cost and efficiency.&nbsp; In the former category, the main concern is that a potential litigant will search far and wide for an expert prepared to express an opinion consonant with the case contended for by the client’s lawyers.&nbsp; Trials thus become a “battle of the experts” with a technically untrained judge selecting between competing theories.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">While the risk of expert partisanship exists in every case, it becomes even more pronounced when this evidence is introduced through external cases, where the expert’s comments originate in a different factual context (see, on this point, <i>R. v. D.D.</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275, 2000 SCC 43, at paras. 13-14, <i>per</i> McLachlin C.J.), and where the parties to the current proceeding do not have an opportunity to test this evidence through leading contrary evidence or through cross-examination.&nbsp; I would reiterate here my comments on the use of extrinsic evidence in <i>R. v. Sappier</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 686, 2006 SCC 54, at para. 71: “I would agree that it is generally wise not to incorporate evidence submitted in other cases without disclosing it to the parties and allowing them the possibility of challenging it or presenting contrary evidence.”&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">In principle there would appear to be nothing to distinguish hypnotically‑refreshed testimony from testimony refreshed by other means. Witnesses daily appear in our courts and give testimony after having reviewed, prior to testifying, reports or notes which were made at the time of their original observations. Indeed, we go so far as to permit witnesses to refer to such notes during the actual process of testifying, where we are satisfied that the notes were made sufficiently contemporaneous with the witness’s original observation. As in the case of hypnosis, there is always a danger that a witness's testimony may have been tainted by information supplied by another individual. An over‑zealous policeman may allow an eye‑witness to review a police report containing a full description of the accused. In the case of such a witness our approach would not be to exclude his evidence; rather, the evidence would be considered unreliable and afforded little weight. . . .</p>

Fliss</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 535, 2002 SCC 16, at para. 45.&nbsp; However, for past recollection recorded evidence to be admissible, conditions are imposed upon the past record used to refresh memory to ensure that it meets certain circumstantial guarantees of reliability: see <i>R. v. Meddoui</i> (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 345 (Alta. C.A.), at p. 352, <i>per</i> Kerans J.A., and<i> Fliss</i>, at paras.&nbsp;63-64.&nbsp; Similarly, Canadian courts have rarely found hypnotically refreshed memories admissible <i>per se</i>, but instead have held <i>voir dires </i>to assess whether such evidence is sufficiently reliable.&nbsp; As earlier noted, compliance with the <i>Clark</i> guidelines has been seen as an important, though not the exclusive, condition of admissibility.</p>

Holmes</i> (1989), 99 A.R. 106 (Q.B.)).&nbsp; However, this has not provoked courts to categorically exclude such evidence.&nbsp; Courts have been satisfied by the fact that witnesses can be cross-examined about how their memories were recalled, the circumstances surrounding the recall and prior inconsistent statements (P. M. Perell, “Proof of an Event of which a Witness Has No Memory” (2003), 26 <i>Advocates’ Q. </i>95, at pp. 100-101).&nbsp; I see no reason why the situation should be any different for hypnotically refreshed memories.&nbsp;</p>

For now, I would simply caution our courts not to encourage the practice of forensic hypnosis until better evidence is available regarding its value.&nbsp; However, I have not been persuaded at this point, on this record, that a complete exclusion of such evidence in all cases is appropriate, as this could deprive the trier of fact from hearing relevant, probative, and even sometimes critical evidence, to either the Crown’s or defence’s case in some instances.&nbsp; In my view, the admissibility of such evidence should always be made on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;Here, the evidence was highly relevant to the Crown’s case and shown to be quite credible.&nbsp; In my view, the trial judge made no legal error in admitting it.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

It is also within the province of the jury to consider how much weight, if any, such evidence should be accorded in the final determination of guilt or innocence. <u>For the trial judge to interfere in that process will in most cases constitute a usurpation of the jury’s exclusive fact‑finding role.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

(as she then was) in<i> Hebert</i>, at p. 185, where she states: “in the absence of eliciting behaviour on the part of the police, there is no violation of the accused’s right to choose whether or not to speak to the police.&nbsp; <u>If the suspect speaks, it is by his or her own choice, and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk</u> that the recipient may inform the police” (emphasis added).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In this context, a “good faith basis” is a function of the information available to the cross-examiner, his or her belief in its likely accuracy, and the purpose for which it is used. Information falling short of admissible evidence may be put to the witness. In fact, the information may be incomplete or uncertain, provided the cross-examiner does not put suggestions to the witness recklessly or that he or she knows to be false. The cross-examiner may pursue any hypothesis that is honestly advanced on the strength of reasonable inference, experience or intuition. The purpose of the question must be consistent with the lawyer's role as an officer of the court: to suggest what counsel genuinely thinks possible on known facts or reasonable assumptions is in our view permissible; to assert or to imply in a manner that is calculated to mislead is in our view improper and prohibited.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">Crown counsel’s question was not improper. He did not ask the appellant to explain why some other witness had lied. Rather, the Crown asked the appellant to confirm his position that the May incident had never occurred. There was evidence, independent of the complainant, suggesting that the event had in fact occurred. Crown counsel wanted to pin down the appellant on his position in the hope that the jury would accept the independent evidence and find that the May incident did occur. If they made that finding, they would have to conclude that the appellant had lied to them on that issue. A finding that the appellant lied on that point could undermine his overall credibility.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Mr. Trochym’s version of events on examination-in-chief was vastly different from that of several other witnesses on several key issues in the case, such as the nature of his relationship with Ms. Hunter, the events of October 13, his whereabouts on October 14, as well as about the day he was told of her death by a family member.&nbsp; Crown counsel was entitled to confirm Mr. Trochym’s position on the events that occurred, and it chose to keep track of the extent of the appellant’s disagreement with other witnesses by asking him to keep a list.&nbsp; Mr. Trochym had experienced counsel, who could have objected to the list, but did not, and deference is due to the decision of the trial judge to permit its use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

P. (M.B.)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, at p. 580, Lamer C.J. described the parties as “locked into” the case presented at trial.&nbsp; In view of this limit, I have difficulty with my colleague’s reproach of the Crown’s submission regarding Ms. Haghnegahdar’s testimony.&nbsp; The facts emphasized in the Crown’s address were those presented at trial.&nbsp; Counsel had agreed not to present the evidence of Ms. Haghnegahdar’s hypnosis at trial.&nbsp; On the witness stand, Ms. Haghnegahdar testified to seeing the witness on Wednesday; her previous confusion was not mentioned.&nbsp; Referring to her evidence in any other fashion than Crown counsel did would have potentially brought up the hypnosis, and not emphasizing this witness’s sighting of the accused, which was crucial evidence to the Crown’s case, would have been poor advocacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

But more importantly, I do not think that there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different without the error: <i>R. v. Bevan</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, and <i>R. v. Charlebois</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 674, 2000 SCC 53.&nbsp; I would add that I disagree with the assertion by Deschamps J., at para. 82, that the standard required for application of the curative proviso is higher than that required for a conviction, and I know of no authority supporting that proposition.</p>

Khan</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, 2001 SCC 86.&nbsp; Even excluding the hypnotically enhanced memories of Ms. Haghnegahdar of seeing the appellant leaving Ms. Hunter’s apartment on Wednesday, as my colleague proposes to do, leaves us with her initial evidence of seeing him on Thursday — a time when her murdered body was inside the apartment. Furthermore, Mr. Trochym had motive and the opportunity to murder Ms. Hunter, and a stranger would not have returned to rearrange the crime scene and move the body. He also seems to have known the means of her death before an innocent party could.&nbsp; Moreover, Mr. Trochym’s version of events on key issues was contradicted by more than half of the more than 40 Crown witnesses who testified. Even excluding all of the impugned evidence, as my colleague would, we are still left with a great deal of highly probative evidence in support of the Crown’s case.</p>
