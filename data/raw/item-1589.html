24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> L’Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin JJ.:&nbsp; Major J.’s reasons and the result he reaches are agreed with.&nbsp; Given the evolving discourse in the legal community concerning evidence of “battered woman syndrome” since this Court’s decision in<i> R. v. Lavallee</i>, the reasons in <i>Lavallee</i> are discussed.&nbsp; The decision in <i>Lavallee</i> is significant for two principal reasons.&nbsp; First, the Court accepted the need for expert evidence in order to dispel the myths and stereotypes inherent in our understanding of a battered woman’s experiences, and of the reasonableness of her actions.&nbsp; Second, the Court accepted that women’s experiences and perspectives in relation to self-defence may be different from the experiences and perspectives of men, and that the perspectives of women must now equally inform the “objective” standard of the reasonable person. “Battered woman syndrome” is not a legal defence in itself, but rather is a psychiatric explanation of the mental state of an abused woman which can be relevant to understanding a battered woman’s state of mind.&nbsp; The utility of such evidence is not limited to self-defence situations, but is potentially relevant to other situations where the reasonableness of a battered woman’s actions or perceptions is at issue.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">When interpreting and applying <i>Lavallee</i>, these broader principles should be kept in mind in order to avoid a too rigid and restrictive approach to the admissibility and legal value of evidence of a battered woman’s experiences.&nbsp; Concerns have been expressed that the treatment of such evidence has led to a new stereotype of the “battered&nbsp; woman”.&nbsp; Such a development must be scrupulously avoided.&nbsp; The legal inquiry must focus on the reasonableness of a battered woman’s actions in the context of her personal experiences, and her experiences as a woman, not on her status as a battered woman and her entitlement to claim that she is suffering from “battered woman syndrome”.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">1.&nbsp; <u>Why an abused woman might remain in an abusive relationship</u>.&nbsp; As discussed in <i>Lavallee</i>, expert evidence may help to explain some of the reasons and dispel some of the misconceptions about why women stay in abusive relationships.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">2.&nbsp; <u>The nature and extent of the violence that may exist in a battering relationship</u>.&nbsp; In considering the defence of self-defence as it applies to an accused who has killed her violent partner, the jury should be instructed on the violence that existed in the relationship and its impact on the accused.&nbsp; The latter will usually but not necessarily be provided by an expert.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">3.&nbsp; <u>The accused’s ability to perceive danger from her abuser</u>.&nbsp; Section 34(2)(<i>a</i>) provides that an accused who intentionally causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling an assault is justified if he or she does so “under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm”.&nbsp; In addressing this issue, Wilson J. for the majority in <i>Lavallee</i> rejected the requirement that the accused apprehend imminent danger.&nbsp; She also stated at pp. 882-83:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Where evidence exists that an accused is in a battering relationship, expert testimony can assist the jury in determining whether the accused had a “reasonable” apprehension of death when she acted by explaining the heightened sensitivity of a battered woman to her partner’s acts.&nbsp; Without such testimony I am skeptical that the average fact-finder would be capable of appreciating why her subjective fear may have been reasonable in the context of the relationship.&nbsp; After all, the hypothetical “reasonable man” observing only the final incident may have been unlikely to recognize the batterer’s threat as potentially lethal. . . .</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">4.&nbsp; <u>Whether the accused believed on reasonable grounds that she could not otherwise preserve herself from death or grievous bodily harm</u><i>.&nbsp; </i>This principle was summarized in <i>Lavallee </i>as follows (at p. 890):</p>

Lavallee</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, and given the evolving discourse on “battered woman syndrome” in the legal community, I will make a few comments on the importance of this kind of evidence to the just adjudication of charges involving battered women.</p>

-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt">36 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the significance of this Court’s decision in <i>Lavallee</i>, which first accepted the need for expert evidence on the effects of abusive relationships in order to properly understand the context in which an accused woman had killed her abusive spouse in self-defence, reaches beyond its particular impact on the law of self-defence.&nbsp; A crucial implication of the admissibility of expert evidence in <i>Lavallee</i> is the legal recognition that historically both the law and society may have treated women in general, and battered women in particular, unfairly.&nbsp; <i>Lavallee</i> accepted that the myths and stereotypes which are the products and the tools of this unfair treatment interfere with the capacity of judges and juries to justly determine a battered woman’s claim of self-defence, and can only be dispelled by expert evidence designed to overcome the stereotypical thinking.&nbsp; The expert evidence is admissible, and necessary, in order to understand the reasonableness of a battered woman’s perceptions, which in <i>Lavallee</i> were the accused’s perceptions that she had to act with deadly force in order to preserve herself from death or grievous bodily harm.&nbsp; Accordingly, the utility of such evidence in criminal cases is not limited to instances where a battered woman is pleading self-defence, but is potentially relevant to other situations where the reasonableness of a battered woman’s actions or perceptions is at issue (e.g.&nbsp;provocation, duress or necessity).&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Hibbert</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, at p.&nbsp;1021.</p>

-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt">37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear from the foregoing that “battered woman syndrome” is not a legal defence in itself such that an accused woman need only establish that she is suffering from the syndrome in order to gain an acquittal.&nbsp; As Wilson J. commented in <i>Lavallee</i>, at p. 890: “Obviously the fact that the appellant was a battered woman does not entitle her to an acquittal.&nbsp; Battered women may well kill their partners other than in self-defence.”&nbsp; Rather, “battered woman syndrome” is a psychiatric explanation of the mental state of women who have been subjected to continuous battering by their male intimate partners, which can be relevant to the legal inquiry into a battered woman’s state of mind.</p>

-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt">41 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should the courts combat the “syndromization”, as Professor Grant refers to it, of battered women who act in self-defence?&nbsp; The legal inquiry into the moral culpability of a woman who is, for instance, claiming self-defence must focus on the <u>reasonableness</u> of her actions in the context of her personal experiences, and her experiences as a woman, not on her status as a battered woman and her entitlement to claim that she is suffering from “battered woman syndrome”.&nbsp; This point has been made convincingly by many academics reviewing the relevant cases:&nbsp; see, e.g., Wendy&nbsp;Chan, “A Feminist Critique of Self-Defense and Provocation in Battered Women’s Cases in England and Wales” (1994), 6 <i>Women &amp; Crim. Just.</i> 39, at pp. 56-57; Elizabeth M. Schneider, “Describing and Changing: Women’s Self-Defense Work and the Problem of Expert Testimony on Battering” (1992), 14 <i>Women’s Rts. L. Rep.</i> 213, at pp. 216-17; and Marilyn MacCrimmon, “The social construction of reality and the rules of evidence”, in Donna Martinson et al., <i>supra</i>, 36, at pp. 48-49.&nbsp; By emphasizing a woman’s “learned helplessness”, her dependence, her victimization, and her low self-esteem, in order to establish that she suffers from “battered woman syndrome”, the legal debate shifts from the objective rationality of her actions to preserve her own life to those personal inadequacies which apparently explain her failure to flee from her abuser.&nbsp; Such an emphasis comports too well with society’s stereotypes about women.&nbsp; Therefore, it should be scrupulously avoided because it only serves to undermine the important advancements achieved by the decision in <i>Lavallee</i>.</p>
