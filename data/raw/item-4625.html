(dissenting):&nbsp; Evidence that tends to show that the blood alcohol concentration of the accused at the time of interception did not exceed the legal limit based on an elimination rate of 15 mg per hour, or on the actual elimination rate of the accused according to test results, will suffice to raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; There is a body of scientific evidence that shows that members of the general population tend to eliminate alcohol at a rate faster than 15 mg per hour.&nbsp; It would therefore be speculative to assume, without any evidence, that a given accused is different from the majority of the general population and is a slow eliminator.&nbsp; Unless the scientific information that supports using 15 mg as a marker is contradicted by persuasive expert evidence, a judge should acquit if the prevailing direction of the straddle range favours a level that does not exceed the legal limit.&nbsp; The prevailing direction approach affords the accused a defence that is sufficiently complete without requiring post‑offence testing.&nbsp; As a matter of judicial policy, requiring accused persons to submit to drinking tests should not be encouraged by the courts.&nbsp; Nevertheless, post‑offence testing is not, <i>per se</i>, irrelevant or lacking in probative value.&nbsp; Just as evidence of average elimination rates in the general population is not discredited simply because such rates do not replicate the situation of an accused, evidence of post‑offence testing designed to determine the elimination rate of an individual accused should not be rejected for that reason alone.&nbsp; An elimination rate based on test results may constitute evidence that tends to show that an accused eliminates alcohol at a rate faster than 15 mg per hour.&nbsp; Although the weight given to post‑offence testing may depend on a number of variables, this should not be interpreted as requiring replication of the conditions of absorption.&nbsp; [84] [90‑91]</span></p>

However, I arrive at this conclusion for different reasons.</p>

Yet, it saw fit to implement the presumption.&nbsp; The legislative scheme must be interpreted in this context.</p>

Yet, it can be no defence for an accused to say that the actual alcohol concentration at the material time may have been less than the legal limit based on this variable alone.&nbsp; To admit such a defence would obviously fly in the face of the presumption itself.&nbsp; It is because of these inherent variations in absorption and elimination rates that the presumption of identity is needed in the first place.&nbsp; In order to facilitate proof of the offence, the presumption treats all persons as one person with a fixed rate of elimination and absorption.</p>

34.8pt;line-height:200%">As a starting point in the consideration of this appeal, it is useful to remember the basis for the legislation in question.&nbsp; The decision to create an .08 standard as establishing intoxication to a point of impairment necessarily rejects an element of individuality in order to meet the higher social advantage of effectively dealing with the serious hazard created by those who drive when they have been drinking and are impaired as a consequence.&nbsp; Inherent in the acceptance of .08 as a standard is the recognition that alcohol does not have the same impact on everyone, depending on such differences as gender, age, weight and individual tolerance levels, but that the extent of the social concern created by impaired drivers and the tragic consequences of a failure to control that problem, dictated the change from an emphasis on an individual’s reaction to alcohol to an emphasis on a standard of general application.&nbsp; The standard is not intended as an absolute one in the sense that it is an accurate assessment of everyone’s state of impairment, as is evident from the fact some jurisdictions have set the figure at .100 (some states in the U.S.A.) and others as low as .06 (some states in Australia).</p>

Moreau</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 261, the accused was charged with “over 80” following a breathalyzer test which showed that his blood alcohol concentration was 90 mg.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreau was convicted, but on appeal by way of a trial <i>de novo</i>, he adduced expert evidence that the breathalyzer was subject to a margin of error of 10 mg.&nbsp; The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to this Court, where the majority concluded that expert evidence of the breathalyzer’s margin of error could not constitute “evidence to the contrary” for the purposes of s. 258(1)(<i>c</i>).&nbsp; Beetz J. provided the following explanation for why such evidence was incapable of rebutting the presumption:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify">What evidence there is, tendered on behalf of the accused, is expert evidence from which Courts are asked to conclude, contrary to what the Code explicitly prescribes, that the result of the chemical analysis is not or ought not to be proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed.&nbsp; This, in my opinion, is not evidence aimed at rebutting the presumption provided for in the section but at denying its very existence.&nbsp; <u>“Evidence to the contrary” cannot be evidence solely directed at defeating the scheme established by Parliament under ss. 236 and 237.</u></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
34.8pt;line-height:200%">This elaborate legislative scheme contemplates and provides for elements of positive certainty such as the official approval of certain kinds of instruments, the designation of analysts and qualified technicians, a maximum time period between the commission of the alleged offence and the taking of a breath sample, and the reading by a qualified technician on an approved instrument of a proportion of alcohol in the blood in excess of a specified proportion.&nbsp; Once the conditions prescribed or contemplated by this scheme are fulfilled, a presumption arises against the alleged offender which he can rebut by tendering “evidence to the contrary”.&nbsp; But in my opinion, no evidence is “evidence to the contrary” when its only effect is to demonstrate in general terms the possible uncertainty of the elements of the scheme or the inherent fallibility of instruments which are approved under statutory authority.&nbsp; Thus, the proof by expert evidence that, for physiological reasons of a general nature, the maximum time period of two hours between the commission of an offence and the taking of a breath sample is too long would not be “evidence to the contrary”.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; pp. 271-72.]</p>

Heideman</i> (2002), 168 C.C.C. (3d) 542.&nbsp; In <i>Heideman</i>, a toxicologist gave evidence that an average person of the accused’s height and weight who consumed alcohol in the same manner as the accused would have had a blood alcohol concentration of 71 mg at the time of driving.&nbsp; However, if the accused was a slow or a fast eliminator, his blood alcohol concentration could have fallen between 47 and 95 mg.&nbsp; The defence argued that the accused should be acquitted because it was more likely than not that his blood alcohol concentration was below 80 mg at the relevant time.&nbsp; Carthy J.A. (Abella and MacPherson JJ.A. concurring) rejected this argument and held that straddle evidence can never rebut the presumption in s. 258(1)(<i>d.</i>1).&nbsp; Rather, the entire range of hypothetical values must fall below 80 mg for the presumption to be set aside.&nbsp; The court reasoned as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

34.8pt;line-height:200%">In the context of an “over 80” charge, it will be necessary for the accused to point to credible evidence which tends to show that his blood alcohol level could have been under the legal limit.&nbsp; This evidence will typically take the form of expert evidence to the effect that the alcohol consumed after driving (or immediately before embarking) would generally affect a person of the accused’s sex, height and body weight within a certain range of values.&nbsp; Thus, for instance, an accused may adduce expert evidence indicating that when the effect of alcohol allegedly consumed after driving is subtracted from the actual blood alcohol reading on the breathalyzer, it would bring the accused’s blood alcohol level to anywhere <u>between 70 and 120 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.&nbsp; This evidence would amount to “evidence to the contrary” of the presumption in s. 258(1)(<i>c</i>)</u>, and the Crown would no longer be able to rely on that presumption to prove its case against the accused.&nbsp; There is no need for the accused to demonstrate that his blood alcohol level is actually below .08.&nbsp; He need only adduce credible evidence tending to show that this is possible under the circumstances.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; para. 103.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:92.15pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">If the answer to both these questions is “yes”, the judge must ask whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; If this question is also answered in the affirmative, the expert evidence is considered relevant for the purpose of determining whether it is admissible.&nbsp; Thus, the inquiry into the relevance branch of the test for admissibility is not conducted differently for expert evidence than for non-opinion evidence. Nevertheless, as noted in <i>Mohan</i>, this inquiry is of particular significance where the admissibility of expert evidence is in issue, because of the risk that such evidence will be accepted uncritically and given more weight than it deserves.</p>

(2d) 161, 2003 MBCA 103, courts have cited <i>Heideman </i>for the principle that “in order to rebut the presumption the evidence must satisfy a court that the accused’s blood alcohol content could not have been above .08” (para. 9).&nbsp; With respect, I do not believe that <i>Heideman </i>supports this conclusion.&nbsp; Rather, the court in <i>Heideman </i>stated that the expert evidence “must indicate that the level was below .08” (para. 13).&nbsp; This is not the same as requiring the elimination of a scenario in which the blood alcohol content of the accused was over 80 mg, to paraphrase the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench in <i>MacDonald.</i>&nbsp; The former is consistent with the concept of straddle evidence, while the latter is not.</p>

(dissenting) —&nbsp; The Court is asked to determine what weight is to be given to “straddle evidence”. In these reasons, I will discuss the appeals of both Mr. Gibson and Mr. MacDonald. The trial judge in Mr. Gibson’s case summarized the three approaches taken by the courts with respect to straddle evidence ((2004), 225 N.S.R. (2d) 16, 2004 NSPC 40).&nbsp; According to the first approach, as held in <i>R. v. Heideman</i> (2002), 168 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (Ont. C.A.), expert evidence based on average elimination rates will suffice only if the entire range of blood alcohol levels does not exceed the legal limit; advocates of this view reject straddle evidence on the basis that it cannot raise a reasonable doubt. According to the second approach, the “prevailing direction” approach, as I understand it, straddle evidence can constitute evidence to the contrary if an elimination rate of 15 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood per hour, which is the midpoint of the range of elimination rates in the general population, places the accused at a level that does not exceed the legal limit.&nbsp; Finally, according to the third approach, the “some evidence” approach, if any part of the “straddle range” falls below the legal limit, the accused is entitled to an acquittal.</p>

With respect, I prefer a standard that gives greater guidance concerning its application and is consistent with the reasonable doubt rule. I adopt the prevailing direction approach.&nbsp; Evidence that tends to show that the blood alcohol concentration of the accused at the time of interception did not exceed the legal limit based on an elimination rate of 15 mg per hour, or on the actual elimination rate of the accused according to test results, will suffice to raise a reasonable doubt.</p>

Courts rely on their expertise, because measuring the blood alcohol concentration of an accused clearly falls outside a judge’s experience and knowledge: <i>R. v. Abbey</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at p. 42. Expert testimony has been accepted for decades on the basis that it can raise a doubt as to whether the blood alcohol concentration of an accused was over the legal limit. An expert will typically give an opinion on the blood alcohol concentration of an accused by taking into consideration his or her sex, age, height and body weight, and the&nbsp; drinking pattern on the day of the alleged offence. The estimated blood alcohol concentration is, in most cases, based on average elimination rates between 10 mg per hour, for slower eliminators, and 20 mg, for faster eliminators.&nbsp; It is generally agreed that most people eliminate alcohol within that range. This type of expert evidence is presented as a range of blood alcohol levels which will either fall entirely below the legal limit or “straddle” that limit. Experts can also conduct post-offence tests in which they attempt to calculate the personal elimination rate of the accused, and then use that rate to estimate a blood alcohol concentration. What is at issue in these appeals is the probative value of straddle evidence and of elimination rates obtained from post-offence testing.</p>

Lifchus</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, at para. 30 (emphasis added). The following comment by Fish J.A., as he then was, is apposite to the present appeals: “The ‘evidence to the contrary’ to which it refers must tend to show — <u>but it need not prove</u> — that the blood‑alcohol level of the accused did not exceed the statutory limit at the relevant time. The exculpatory evidence, in other words, must have probative value, but it need not be so cogent as to persuade the court” (<i>R. v. Dubois </i>(1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 90 (Que. C.A.), at p. 92 (emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted)). Therefore, when an accused adduces straddle evidence, that evidence need not prove his or her blood alcohol level at the time of interception. It is sufficient that the evidence tends to show that the blood alcohol level of the accused did not exceed the legal limit at the material time.</p>

Dr. Jerry L. Malicky, Mr. MacDonald’s expert, testified that <i>most</i> of the 5,000 people he has tested eliminated alcohol in the range between 15 mg and 20 mg. Dr. Malicky further indicated that the American Medical Association has adopted an average elimination rate of 18 mg and that the RCMP Crime Laboratory has adopted a rate of 15 mg.&nbsp; Dr. Malicky’s expert testimony provides scientific information falling outside a judge’s experience and knowledge according to which members of the general population tend to eliminate alcohol at a rate faster than 15 mg. Unless such evidence is undermined during cross-examination by a circumstance specific to the case that renders it inapplicable, or is contradicted by other expert evidence, a judge can acquit an accused if the prevailing direction of the straddle range favours a level that does not exceed the legal limit.&nbsp; A conclusion, based on an elimination rate of 15 mg, that the blood alcohol concentration of an accused did not exceed the legal limit would be based on credible and persuasive expert evidence. This evidence would tend to show that it is more likely than not that the blood alcohol level of the accused did not exceed that limit. The 15 mg marker offers an easily applicable standard on the basis of which an accused need only raise a reasonable doubt to the effect that his blood alcohol content may not have exceeded the legal limit.</p>

R. Solomon and E. Chamberlain note in “Calculating BACs for Dummies: The Real‑World Significance of Canada’s 0.08% Criminal BAC Limit for Driving” (2004), 8 <i>Can. Crim. L.R.</i> 219, at p. 232, that an elimination rate of 15 mg per hour “seems to be widely accepted as ‘average’ in Canada”. These authors consider 15 mg to be a more conservative estimate than the figures used by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) (p. 233). According to the NHTSA, the average elimination rate for moderate drinkers is 17 mg, whereas the average rate for heavy drinkers is 20 mg. The NHTSA also indicates that less than 20 percent of the population would exhibit an elimination rate of 12 mg (p. 230). These figures correspond to those of Dr. Malicky and suggest that most members of the general population tend to eliminate alcohol at a rate faster than 15 mg.</p>

In <i>R. v. Déry</i>, [2001] Q.J. No. 3205 (QL) (C.A.), the expert evidence adduced at trial showed that the blood alcohol level of the accused would have been in a range straddling the legal limit. However, the expert testified that, according to his own and other scientific studies, an elimination rate of 15 mg per hour applied to 95 percent of the population. The Quebec Court of Appeal accordingly accepted that expert evidence based on an elimination rate of 15 mg could constitute evidence to the contrary: <i>Déry</i>, at paras. 28-32; <i>R. v. Bellemare</i>, [2001] Q.J. No. 3304 (QL) (C.A.), at paras. 15-20; <i>R. v. Nault</i>, [2001] Q.J. No. 3201 (QL) (C.A.), at paras. 19-22; <i>R. v. Thiffeault</i>, [2001] Q.J. No. 3198 (QL) (C.A.), at paras. 16-20. Similarly, in <i>R. v. Gibson </i>(1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 28 (Sask. C.A.), expert evidence showed that the range of the accused straddled the legal limit.&nbsp; However, the expert had testified at trial that, although the range straddled the legal limit, the blood alcohol content of the accused would, based on an average, have been 79 mg. The majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal concluded that such evidence could constitute evidence to the contrary.</p>

They add that straddle evidence establishes a range of possible blood alcohol levels without indicating the actual level of the accused. These are legitimate concerns. However, as can be seen from Dr. Malicky’s testimony, there is a body of scientific evidence that shows that members of the general population tend to eliminate alcohol at a rate faster than 15 mg per hour. It would therefore be speculative to assume, without any evidence, that a given accused is different from the majority of the general population and is a slow eliminator. Unless the scientific information that supports using 15 mg as a marker is contradicted by persuasive expert evidence, a judge should acquit if the prevailing direction of the straddle range favours a level that does not exceed the legal limit. The accused has no persuasive burden and accordingly does not need to prove that his or her blood alcohol level actually did not exceed the legal limit. This in turn means that the accused need not definitely establish that he or she is not a slow eliminator of alcohol.</p>

If an accused chooses to submit to post‑offence testing, care should be taken to strike an appropriate balance between the need for the evidence and the concern for his or her safety and health. Nevertheless, post-offence testing is not, <i>per se</i>, irrelevant or lacking in probative value. I take issue with the view that since the conditions prevailing at the time of the offence cannot be replicated, there is nothing to be gained from post-offence testing. This view is unsupported by evidence. Just as evidence of average elimination rates in the general population is not discredited simply because such rates do not replicate the situation of an accused, evidence of post-offence testing designed to determine the elimination rate of an individual accused should not be rejected for that reason alone. An elimination rate based on test results may constitute evidence that tends to show that an accused eliminates alcohol at a rate faster than 15 mg per hour. Although the weight given to post-offence testing may depend on a number of variables, this should not be interpreted as requiring replication of the conditions of absorption, which is an issue that arises in Mr. MacDonald’s case.</p>

I agree. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and restore the Nova Scotia Supreme Court’s decision to affirm the trial judge’s judgment acquitting Mr. Gibson on the charge of driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding the legal limit.</p>

Then, using an approved instrument, he took 11 samples of the subject’s breath and prepared a graph showing the relationship between blood alcohol and time. He subsequently estimated the subject’s elimination rate (A.R., at p. 78). Dr. Malicky also testified that he never uses beer as a testing beverage because it takes a significant amount of time for beer to be absorbed. He instead uses vodka mixed with soft drinks, which allows for fairly rapid absorption to occur. The use of vodka rather than beer insures that the subject has absorbed all the alcohol (A.R., at p. 73).</p>

Consequently, using a liquid that contains 40 percent pure alcohol, like most types of liquor, instead of one that contains 5 percent, like most types of beer, or 12 percent, like many types of wine, will not affect the value of the test. Only “pure alcohol” is relevant for the purpose of determining the blood alcohol concentration. Moreover, post-offence testing under fasting conditions is less favourable to the accused: “If an individual eats before or while drinking, this would slow down the rate at which the alcohol is absorbed into the blood and, thus, <u>lower</u> the individual’s peak [blood alcohol concentration]” (Solomon and Chamberlain, at p. 230 (emphasis added); see also p. 233 and A.R., at p. 73).</p>

Although he acknowledged that elimination rates can vary from occasion to occasion (A.R., at p. 70) and that the post‑offence test may not represent Mr. MacDonald’s rate of elimination at the material time (A.R., at p. 81), nothing in his testimony suggests that factors such as fasting or type of alcohol will lead to a higher elimination rate. The record is silent on how these variables affect elimination rates.&nbsp; I find it highly troubling and offensive for a court to impeach an expert’s credibility by dismissing post‑offence testing, without an indication that the testing conditions were inadequate, on the basis that it does not adequately replicate the conditions at the time of interception.&nbsp; Testing conditions are in the domain of experts, not of the courts. Courts need evidence in order to question the weight of expert testimony. Moreover, Dr. Malicky’s testimony in other cases where the Crown questioned testing conditions demonstrates how perilous it is for courts to speculate that the result of a post-offence test is biassed in favour of an accused: <i>R. v. Milne</i> (2006), 43 M.V.R. (5th) 167, 2006 ABPC 331, and <i>R. v. Hughes</i>, [2007] A.J. No. 740 (QL), 2007 ABPC 180.</p>

Although Mr. MacDonald’s elimination rate according to Dr. Malicky’s test may not be the same as his rate on the day of the offence, nothing in the record suggests that any variation between the actual and tested elimination rates would be material or would cast doubt on the usefulness of the expert evidence.</p>

The trial judge made no express findings on whether he accepted Mr. MacDonald’s testimony about his consumption. He rejected Dr. Malicky’s evidence on the basis that the midpoint of the straddle range was above the legal limit and that the food and the type of alcohol consumed had not been taken into account in the post-offence tests. Since he had dismissed Dr. Malicky’s expert testimony, the trial judge found Mr. MacDonald guilty without making any findings concerning his credibility. This Court cannot enter an acquittal, as a finding on Mr. MacDonald’s credibility would have had to be made first. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal’s decision and order a new trial on the charge of driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding the legal limit.</p>
