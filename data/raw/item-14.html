At the hearing of the Review Board on April&nbsp;3, 2002, the Board felt that the accused’s treatment had reached an impasse and expressed concerns over the inadequate information provided by the accused’s case manager and treatment team, as well as the accused’s reluctance to cooperate with this treatment team.&nbsp; The Board ordered that the accused continue to be held in custody at the hospital. &nbsp;The disposition order required the Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services, for the accused’s next hearing, to provide an independent evaluation of the accused’s diagnosis, treatment, and clinical progress; to provide an independent evaluation of his public safety risk in light of a new, refocused treatment plan; and, to undertake assertive efforts to enroll the accused in a culturally appropriate treatment program.&nbsp; The Director appealed to the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; It held that the Board did not have jurisdiction to make an order imposing medical treatment or to make conditions binding on anyone other than the accused.&nbsp; It struck the conditions imposed on the Director from the order. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The operational scheme of Part&nbsp;XX.1 and the way the courts have interpreted it reveal that Review Boards do not have the power to prescribe treatment.&nbsp; The authority to do so lies exclusively within the mandate of the provincial authority in charge of the hospital where the NCR accused is detained, pursuant to various provincial laws governing the provision of medical services to persons in the custody of a hospital facility.&nbsp; The role of Review Boards is merely to ensure that opportunities for medical treatment are provided.&nbsp; Granting Review Boards the power to impose treatment would interfere with the provincial legislative competence over health services.&nbsp; The composition of the Board and the expertise of its members support this interpretation of a Board’s powers under s.&nbsp;672.54.&nbsp; If a Board could prescribe treatment, the two members with no expertise in psychiatry could conceivably render a disposition over the objections of the third member who is required by the <i>Code</i> to be entitled to practise psychiatry.&nbsp; Granting Review Boards the power to prescribe treatment would also grant a similar power to courts despite their lack of relevant expertise, because a court hearing an appeal from a Board’s order can make any disposition that the Board could have made.

In accordance with the applicable legislative scheme, Mazzei was ordered to be held in strict custody at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute, a secure inpatient facility located in Port Coquitlam, B.C., “at the pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor in Council”.&nbsp; Mazzei was diagnosed by a number of psychiatrists; the consensus seems to be that he suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, a serious antisocial personality disorder, and organic brain damage, all of which appear to have been exacerbated by long-term and chronic substance abuse.&nbsp; In 1992, pursuant to the new Part XX.1 of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, Mazzei was re-classified as “NCR” and fell under the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Review Board (“Board”). Mazzei’s numerous Board hearings resulted in several conditional discharges; all but one of these orders led to Mazzei being returned to strict hospital custody, either because of breaches of conditions of discharge, or because his unchanged mental condition, antisocial behaviour and substance abuse continued to give rise to a threat to public safety. On October 1, 2001, while under a conditional discharge, Mazzei pleaded guilty to theft under $5,000; this was a breach of a previous Board order. On November 1, 2001, the Board ordered that Mazzei be placed at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital (“Hospital”), but stated that this order should be reviewed within six months.</p>

Mazzei’s counsel urged the Board to take a new approach to his treatment, and to involve aboriginal resources and programs. However, the Board also heard evidence that Mazzei was “reluctant” to cooperate with his treatment team, and that he engaged in patterns of substance abuse and escape attempts (see Board’s decision, at pp. 1-2). The Board expressed concern over the “late” and inadequate information provided by Mazzei’s case manager and treatment team; his supervising psychiatrist’s absence at the hearing; and his case manager’s inability to answer many of the Board’s questions (p. 2).</p>

However, the Board felt that Mazzei’s medical treatment, clinical progress and reintegration prospects had reached a “troubling crossroads or impasse”, and that Mazzei was “stuck in an untenable and unlikely-to-resolve situation” (p. 3). The Board indicated that Mazzei’s current treatment plan “is meeting neither his nor the public’s needs” (p. 4). Accordingly, the Board directed the respondent, the Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services at the Hospital ( “Director”), to reconsider Mazzei’s current plan and explore new options. Specifically, the Board included the following three conditions in its disposition order, which are the subject of this appeal:</p>

The Director alleged that the Board lacked the jurisdiction to impose conditions 8, 9 and 10. The B.C.C.A. unanimously allowed the appeal. Ryan J.A., writing for the court, found that according to the statutory scheme and the intent of Parliament, the role of the Board is restricted to the management of the NCR accused for the protection of the public, while the Director is responsible for the accused’s medical treatment (para. 79). A Board cannot make an order imposing medical treatment without violating this division of roles and responsibilities. Ryan J.A. also stated that when making a disposition order under s.&nbsp;672.54, a Review Board may only impose conditions which are reasonable and necessary, based on expert evidence. Ryan J.A. found that it is “implicit in the scheme” that hospital staff “would be the experts recommending and delivering the treatment”; as a result, an order requiring them to consider and deliver medical treatment to Mazzei “would be redundant” (para. 77). Furthermore, Ryan J.A. found that the jurisprudence indicates that the Board cannot make conditions binding on anyone other than the accused (para. 90). Ryan J.A. concluded that conditions 8, 9 and 10 constituted an excess of jurisdiction, and an “interference” in matters wholly within the Director’s mandate; as such, they were struck from the order (para. 91). Mazzei now appeals this decision.</p>

These conditions are clearly linked to the Board’s mandate to assess and manage Mazzei’s threat to public safety, and were part of an appropriate disposition order aimed at protecting society while minimizing restrictions on his liberty.</p>

This power is derived from the Director’s status as a participant in the Review Board disposition process and in fostering the rehabilitation and community reintegration of an accused. The extent of this power, especially with respect to medical treatment, is revealed by a contextual and purposive examination of the legislation. Pursuant to this Court’s analysis in <i>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, the purpose of s.&nbsp;672.54 is to create a mechanism by which Review Boards assess and manage the risk to public safety represented by certain NCR accused persons, and craft appropriate disposition orders which protect society and facilitate the medical treatment of the accused, while restricting their liberty as little as possible.</p>

The Director argues that the Board has no power over the medical services provided to an NCR accused. The respondents argue that the Board’s function is only meant to provide the accused with due process and fairness; its power is simply to obtain information to assess the risk posed by the accused, and make an appropriate disposition. That order must be concerned solely with managing the accused’s safety risk; it cannot interfere with the doctor-patient relationship established between the hospital and the accused. Conditions in an order bind the accused and no one else, since they can only touch on issues of security, hospital privileges and/or community access, and cannot address medical treatment issues.</p>

As a result, the Board must have the power to bind persons other than the accused. Ultimately, while the Board may not make conditions imposing treatment (outside of limited and narrow exceptions), it must have the power to scrutinize the current treatment plan and require the Director to explore alternative approaches.

Ontario also argues that while a Board has the authority to make conditions binding on hospital authorities, it does not have the power to enforce them. While the Board has no authority to prescribe treatment, it must craft dispositions which provide opportunities for treatment. The Board has the authority to gather existing information in order to assess an accused’s safety risk, but it cannot require the production of “new” information.</p>

CLAS advocates a results-oriented approach where the court identifies the “appropriate outcome” based on concepts seen as “obviously true” by the community. A common-sense and practical interpretation of s. 672.54 requires hospital authorities to be bound by orders which engage the requisite support and services. CLAS submits that the Board may issue binding conditions on the Director to treat Mazzei, if the order is the “least onerous and least restrictive” possible.</p>

MHLAC argues that Review Boards must have the power to make conditions concerning medical treatment binding on hospital authorities, to the extent that the accused consents or requests this of the Board, and if the treatment is reasonable and necessary. Ultimately, MHLAC argues that in order to achieve a patient-centred mental health system, the Board must play a supervisory role with respect to treatment, and must therefore have the power to make binding treatment orders.</p>

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at pp. 353-54). However, all parties agree (as they did before the B.C.C.A., and as did the B.C.C.A. itself) that because the impugned order is “capable of repetition, yet evasive of review” (B.C.C.A., at para. 3), the appeal should still be heard. The issue here (the Board’s powers) remains unresolved and is likely to come before the courts again. Yet it is “evasive of review” in terms of requiring a “live” dispute between parties in an adversarial context; this is because new orders are continuously crafted, and as is the case here, a controversial order may be quickly overtaken by subsequent orders. This Court should therefore exercise its discretion (as per <i>Borowski</i>) to hear this appeal.</p>

Under s. 672.78(1)(<i>b</i>), a court of appeal may allow an appeal from a disposition order if that order is based on a “<u>wrong</u> decision on a question of law”. Here, the Director appealed the Board’s order because of an alleged excess of jurisdiction concerning its ability to issue binding orders relating to Mazzei’s treatment. Because this is a “question of law” arising from the interpretation of s. 672.54, the standard of review is undeniably that of “correctness”, in accordance with the wording of s. 672.78(1)(<i>b</i>). That is, the Board must be correct in interpreting its powers under s. 672.54, because it cannot make a “wrong” decision in that regard. This was the standard adopted by the B.C.C.A. at paras. 27‑28. It is also implicitly echoed in this Court’s jurisprudence: see&nbsp; <i>Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 498, 2004 SCC 20 (“<i>Penetanguishene</i>”), and <i>Pinet v.

This is mandated by s. 672.78(1)(<i>a</i>), which states that a court of appeal may allow an appeal from a Board disposition order if that order “is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”, which corresponds to the administrative law standard of review of “reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i>”. This was confirmed in <i>R. v. Owen</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, 2003 SCC 33, at para. 33:&nbsp; “the Court of Appeal should ask itself whether the Board’s risk assessment and disposition order was unreasonable in the sense of not being supported by reasons that can bear even a somewhat probing examination .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; If the Board’s decision is such that it could reasonably be the subject of disagreement among Board members properly informed of the facts and instructed on the applicable law, the court should in general decline to intervene”. It should be noted that the (un)reasonableness of conditions 8, 9 and 10 in the present case was only an alternative ground of appeal by the Director at the B.C.C.A. (and it is only briefly discussed in the Director’s factum before this Court).&nbsp; It was not explicitly raised as an issue in this appeal by the appellant Mazzei; furthermore, it is clearly a moot issue. Nevertheless, this Court should still address the reasonableness issue in order to provide guidance to courts and Review Boards in the future.</p>

The Director, and the treatment team and hospital administration by implication, are bound by Board orders and conditions. This stems from the wording of s. 672.54, the legislative scheme, Parliament’s intent and the relevant case law.</p>

The threshold determination is whether the accused represents a “significant threat to the safety of the public”. If there is no threat, the NCR accused must be “discharged absolutely” (s. 672.54(<i>a</i>)). If there is a threat, the Board must order that the accused be “discharged subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate” (s. 672.54(<i>b</i>)) or “detained in custody in a hospital, subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate” (s. 672.54(<i>c</i>)). Ultimately, the order made must be “the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused”, taking into consideration the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the accused’s mental condition, his reintegration into society and his “other needs”.</p>

When the Board orders anything other than an absolute discharge, it either directs that the NCR accused “be discharged <u>subject to</u> such conditions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” or that the NCR accused “be detained in custody in a hospital, <u>subject to</u> such conditions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”. It is the actual disposition (the conditional discharge or the hospital detention) which is “subject to” appropriate conditions — not the accused himself. The wording does not suggest, explicitly or implicitly, that the conditions refer to the accused’s conduct and obligations. If Parliament had intended to ensure that conditions in disposition orders could only target and bind the accused, the statutory language would have been much more explicit. For example, the text could have indicated that the accused be discharged or detained “<u>and be</u> subject to such conditions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (emphasis added).&nbsp; This wording would clearly indicate that it is the accused, and only the accused, who is targeted by the conditions imposed. The absence of such wording leaves the target of the Board’s conditions open and indeterminate, such that orders and conditions may also bind other persons such as hospital authorities like the Director, depending on the circumstances.</p>

While the English version indicates that the Board shall “direct” that the accused be discharged or detained subject to certain conditions (thus emphasizing the verb), the French text emphasizes the noun “<i>décision</i>” when it addresses the conditions in a disposition order. In the French text, the Board shall make “<i>une <u>décision</u> portant libération de l’accusé <u>sous réserve</u> des modalités</i>”, or “<i>une <u>décision</u> portant détention de l’accusé dans un hôpital <u>sous réserve</u> des modalités</i>”.&nbsp; The French version indicates that it is the decision itself which is “subject to” appropriate conditions, rather than the accused himself. As with the English text, if the accused were the sole target of the conditions, the French text would have employed words indicating that the <i>accused</i> would be “<i>sujet à</i>” or “<i>soumis à</i>” certain conditions.</p>

By specifying that Review Boards are mandated to “direct” what happens to an NCR accused, rather than merely “ordering” a conditional discharge or hospital detention, the wording of s. 672.54 suggests that Parliament intended that Review Boards should supervise the process of implementing a disposition order or condition. The verb “to direct” is synonymous with controlling, supervising or governing the actions of others, including ordering them to carry out a decision: see<i> Concise Oxford English Dictionary </i>(11th ed. 2004), p. 406, “direct”. This would imply that Review Boards have the power to bind others to their orders and conditions.</p>

Whenever a Review Board or a court renders a decision under Part XX.1, the legislative scheme presupposes that hospital staff involved in the implementation of that decision or order shall abide by its terms. It would be illogical, as noted by the appellant and some of the interveners, for the Board to order the hospital detention of an accused without the ability to bind the person in charge of the hospital, and the treatment team and administrative staff involved in implementing this detention. If Boards are mandated to “make or review dispositions concerning any [NCR] accused” pursuant to ss. 672.38(1), with the specific mandate to make orders under s. 672.54 and to review such orders under s. 672.81, they cannot do so without the power to bind all hospital authorities involved.</p>

The respondents point out that the enforcement provisions of Part XX.1 (ss. 672.9 to 672.94) only contemplate consequences for the accused upon a breach of a disposition order or condition. However, this ignores the reality that the accused is under no obligation to abide by the terms and conditions of a Board’s order other than his or her general submission to the State’s criminal law power; as a result, specific enforcement provisions are required to ensure the NCR accused’s compliance. In contrast, other parties involved (hospital authorities, for example) are already bound by provincial statutes to assume custody of the accused and provide treatment in accordance with the duties set out in those statutes, such as the British Columbia <i>Mental Health Act</i> and <i>Forensic Psychiatry Act</i>. The legislative scheme in Part XX.1 assumes that hospital authorities such as the Director are expected to comply, and will comply, with Board orders and conditions as a result of these specific statutory obligations. Because there is no such compulsion with respect to the accused, Part XX.1 provides a specific enforcement mechanism for ensuring the compliance and cooperation of the NCR accused regarding the implementation of Board orders.</p>

As “parties” to the proceedings under s. 672.1, both the Director and the NCR accused are bound by a Board’s disposition order and the conditions found therein. Either party may appeal that disposition order in whole or in part, on a question of law, fact, or mixed law and fact (see s. 672.72(1)). A provincial court of appeal then has the discretion to allow the appeal if the disposition order (or a part thereof) is “unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”, is based on “a wrong decision on a question of law”, or gives rise to “a miscarriage of justice” (s. 672.78(1)). The Director’s ability to appeal dispositions in whole or in part assumes and confirms the intention of Parliament that the Director be bound by those dispositions. Thus, because of their status as “parties” to Board proceedings, and because of their wide rights of appeal, hospital authorities such as the Director must comply with Board orders and conditions.</p>

This legislative intent has been extensively discerned and developed in the jurisprudence dealing with Part XX.1. The amendments in Part XX.1 were designed to respond to and overcome the problems and concerns identified by this Court in <i>R. v. Swain</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, with respect to the former legislative scheme’s lack of procedural protections and assurances of dignity and fairness for mentally ill offenders. The former scheme was found to be, in pith and substance, legislation aimed at “the protection of society from dangerous people who have engaged in conduct proscribed by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> through the prevention of such acts in the future” (<i>Swain</i>, at p. 998). The medical treatment of mentally ill offenders, according to this analysis, “may be incidentally involved in the process” but it is “not the dominant objective of the legislation” (<i>ibid</i>.). Medical treatment was therefore part of the old scheme, but it was “not prescribed by the impugned provisions; rather, it constitutes the means to achieving their end, the protection of society” (<i>Swain</i>, at p. 1005). The problem with the former scheme was not its purpose or the way in which it incorporated a peripheral or ancillary concern for the medical treatment of mentally ill offenders; the problem lay in the lack of protections for procedural fairness and for ensuring the dignity and liberty interests of the NCR accused.</p>

The new element added in Part XX.1 is an assurance of procedural fairness and dignity for the NCR accused, and a commitment to ensure that the NCR accused’s liberty interests are to be infringed as minimally as possible. Writing for the majority in <i>Winko</i>, McLachlin&nbsp;J. (as she then was) affirmed that the dual purpose of Part XX.1 is: (1) “protect[ion of] the public”, and (2) “fair treatment” of the accused (see, for example, at paras. 20, 21 and 44). This was repeated in <i>Penetanguishene</i>, at paras. 19, 30 and 69, in <i>Pinet</i>,<i> </i>at paras. 1 and 19, as well as&nbsp; in <i>R. v. Demers</i>, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 489, 2004 SCC 46, at para. 18.</p>

The appellant in this case has perhaps erroneously equated McLachlin J.’s concern in <i>Winko</i> (at paras. 20, 21 and 30) for “fair treatment”, in the sense of “due process”, with a concern for providing fair “medical” treatment (see paras. 16, 27 and 39-42). As discussed below, this confusion may have led to the mistaken belief that Review Boards are mandated to actively participate in the provision of medical services for NCR accused persons. Although both concepts are occasionally used concurrently (see paras. 42-43), in general they are to remain separate. Nonetheless, medical treatment does play an important role in Part XX.1. This is because the “twin goals” of protection of the public and fairness to the accused are made possible by an individualized “assessment-treatment” model (see <i>Winko</i>, at paras. 16 and 41-44). NCR accused persons are assessed according to their level of risk or threat to public safety; they are then placed or managed accordingly, the measures taken being designed to impinge on their liberty interests as little as possible. This management of the accused may or may not include medical treatment with a view to reducing the level of risk and facilitating rehabilitation and community reintegration; this will usually be the case for hospital detention orders under s. 672.54(<i>c</i>). Thus, while the “fair treatment” of the accused (i.e., ensuring that the accused is managed with dignity and in a procedurally fair manner) is one of the primary goals of Part XX.1, the provision of “opportunities [for] appropriate [medical] treatment” (see <i>Winko</i>, at paras. 39 and 43) is one of the tools used to achieve this goal. As McLachlin J. stated in <i>Winko</i> (at para. 44), s. 672.54 “seeks to <u>further the aims</u> of Part XX.1&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <u>through</u> the assessment‑treatment model<span lang="EN-GB">” (emphasis added). </span></p>

In order to fulfill their statutory mandate to oversee the assessment and “fair treatment” (in the “due process” sense) of NCR accused persons, Review Boards must have the authority and power to make their orders and conditions binding on the accused as well as on other parties involved, such as the person in charge of the hospital where the accused will be detained, managed and medically treated. Parliament could not have intended to create a statutory body charged with overseeing and implementing the “assessment-treatment” model without ensuring that it would have the power to compel others to abide by its orders and conditions; otherwise, the purpose of the legislation would be frustrated. These principles have been repeated and confirmed in this Court’s post-<i>Winko</i> jurisprudence on Part XX.1: see <i>Penetanguishene</i>, <i>Pinet</i>, <i>Demers</i> and <i>Owen</i>.</p>

To reiterate, the primary purpose of the legislative scheme is to protect the public while minimizing any restrictions on the NCR accused’s liberty interests; as such, the expression “fair treatment” coined in <i>Winko</i> refers only to an assurance of dignity and procedural fairness when assessing and managing the safety risk posed by NCR accused persons. The provision of medical services in this context is merely a logical and inevitable (but ancillary and incidental) effect of Part XX.1’s focus on public safety and community reintegration. The provision of medical services under Part XX.1 is therefore to be engaged <i>only</i> in order to help achieve the goals of public safety and maximization of liberty interests (except, of course, for other medical services performed by hospital staff pursuant to the hospital’s responsibilities for the health of its patients, with respect to other illnesses or conditions not directly related to or part of the mental illness or condition of the NCR accused which has led to his or her “NCR” designation). The medical treatment of the NCR accused can only occur with a view to reducing the accused’s level of threat to public safety and creating a situation where it is no longer significant, thereby permitting reintegration into society. According to McLachlin J. in <i>Winko</i> (at paras. 39-40), medical treatment “is necessary to stabilize the mental condition of a dangerous NCR accused and reduce the threat to public safety created by that condition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Providing opportunities for effective medical treatment furthers the objective of public safety by attempting to reduce the safety risk posed by the NCR accused; it also furthers the objective of safeguarding the accused’s liberty interests by working towards community reintegration and the cessation of most if not all restrictions on the accused’s liberty. The provision of opportunities for medical treatment is therefore consistent with (and incidental to) the primary purposes of the legislation, without overriding or supplanting those aims.</p>

Such an exercise would constitute interference with the authority and responsibility of hospital authorities to provide medical services to persons in their custody according to <i>their</i> view of what is appropriate and effective. Legislative authority to enact laws governing the administration of medical services and treatment for all persons in a hospital facility (including NCR accused persons) rests with the provinces under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec92subsec7" target="_blank">s. 92(7)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, not with Parliament. Prevention of crime and protection against dangerous persons through its s. 91(27) criminal law power is the only possible reason or rationale for Parliament’s involvement in the medical treatment of NCR accused persons. Indeed, an NCR accused who is discharged absolutely under s.&nbsp;672.54(<i>a</i>) may require psychiatric treatment, but no such treatment may be ordered by a Review Board. Section 672.54 has no application if such a person does not present a significant threat to public safety; that person is no longer justifiably subject to the criminal law power of the State, and any medical treatment to deal with his or her mental condition must be ordered pursuant to some other legislative authority. It is logical that such authority could only be found in areas of provincial legislative competence over health services.</p>

Review Boards are mandated under s. 672.38(1) to “make or review dispositions” concerning NCR accused persons. Their dispositions must reflect the twin goals of public protection and fair treatment of the NCR accused; they must also be consistent with the “assessment-treatment” model created by Part XX.1, which focuses on assessing and managing risks to public safety by providing opportunities for effective and appropriate treatment. In contrast, the hospitals where NCR accused persons are detained&nbsp; are defined as places “for the custody, <u>treatment</u> or assessment of an accused”, pursuant to s. 672.1. Thus, the competing statutory definitions and mandates of Review Boards and hospital authorities reflect a certain division of labour and authority. This is reinforced by the absence of any global definition of “treatment” in Part XX.1; what constitutes medical treatment should be governed by provincial law, given that it is provincial hospital authorities who will determine and deliver medical services. For example, under s. 30 of the British Columbia <i>Mental Health Act</i>, an NCR accused detained in a provincial mental health facility or hospital “must receive care and treatment appropriate to the condition of the person <u>as authorized by the director</u>”.&nbsp; Parliament thus intended to leave specific treatment decisions to provincial health authorities, while Review Boards would remain responsible for crafting dispositions which ensure that treatment <i>opportunities</i> are provided to the NCR accused. Review Boards were therefore not intended to exercise any powers which could potentially interfere with hospitals’ discretion concerning the provision of medical services.</p>

For example, in <i>Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Wiebe</i>, [2005] 2 W.W.R. 707, the Manitoba Court of Appeal agreed with the B.C.C.A.’s decision in the present appeal, concluding that “it is no business of a court or the Board in fulfilling its mandate under sec. 672.54 of the <i>Code</i> to prescribe a specific course of medical treatment” (para. 32). The Manitoba Court of Appeal appeared to agree with the arguments of the Manitoba Review Board in that case that “issues relating to the care and treatment of the mentally ill are matters of provincial jurisdiction” and that “it is not Parliament’s responsibility to treat detainees but rather that of the provinces” (para. 28).</p>

The membership of the Board must include at least one member entitled to practise psychiatry, and if there is only one such member, it must also include at least one other member who has training in mental health issues and is entitled to practise medicine or psychology (s. 672.39). While this would appear to suggest a certain level of expertise with respect to medical treatment issues, this expertise cannot justify an interpretation of s. 672.54 whereby Review Boards can make orders actually prescribing treatment. The fact that at least one or two members may have some expertise or training in psychiatric and/or psychological issues does not enable the Board to “step into the shoes” of the accused’s physician or treatment team. This is clear, considering that a quorum of the Board for purposes of making a disposition order under s. 672.54 consists of three members, only one of whom must be entitled to practise psychiatry (s. 672.41(1)), and that any Board order is decided by “a majority of the members present” (s. 672.42). Thus, if a Board were authorized to make an order actually prescribing medical treatment for an NCR accused, it could conceivably do so pursuant to a majority vote of two Board members who do not have any psychiatric training or expertise, and over the objections of a psychiatrist; it is therefore hard to see how the Board’s expertise in matters of psychiatric treatment would justify its ability to make binding orders actually prescribing medical treatment in such circumstances.</p>

Under s. 672.78(3)(<i>a</i>), a provincial court of appeal is entitled to “make any disposition under section 672.54 or any placement decision that the Review Board could have made” if it allows the appeal. If the appellant’s position is accepted (i.e., that Boards have the ability to prescribe treatment), it is arguable that a court of appeal could also prescribe medical treatment under s. 672.78(3)(<i>a</i>) if the original Board order failed to do so. Appellate judges, however, need not have any expertise, training or experience in medical or psychiatric issues whatsoever. It is difficult to conceive that Parliament would have intended Review Boards to have the jurisdiction and authority to issue binding treatment orders and conditions, since this would also enable reviewing courts to do the same, without having the relevant and necessary expertise.</p>

Review Boards are in effect empowered to make orders and conditions “related to” or “regarding” an NCR accused’s medical treatment (or the supervision of such treatment) while in the custody of a provincial hospital; Review Boards also have the power, as discussed above, to make such orders and conditions binding on all parties involved, including hospital authorities. In essence, conditions “regarding” medical treatment or its supervision are those conditions&nbsp; that Review Boards may impose to ensure that the NCR accused is provided with opportunities for appropriate and effective medical treatment, in order to help reduce the risk to public safety and to facilitate rehabilitation and community reintegration. The scope of this power would arguably include anything short of actually prescribing that treatment be carried out by hospital authorities. It would therefore include the power to require hospital authorities and staff to question and reconsider past or current treatment plans or diagnoses, and explore alternatives which might be more effective and appropriate. The authority for this power is derived from the purpose of the legislative scheme, the mandate and expertise of Review Boards, and the wording of various sections of Part XX.1; it is also echoed in the jurisprudence.</p>

Given that Part XX.1 is at least partly aimed at providing opportunities for appropriate medical/psychiatric treatment to the NCR accused, as part of the overall goals of protecting the public while safeguarding the liberty interests of the accused, Review Boards must have the power to impose conditions which relate to those opportunities and to the provision and supervision of medical services. If Review Boards did not have this power, then the legislative goal of providing opportunities for medical treatment, where appropriate, would be frustrated.</p>

By the very definition of a verdict of “not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder”, the accused’s mental condition is effectively the reason why the accused is now subject to Part XX.1, and in most cases it is the very reason why the accused represents a threat to public safety and why the accused’s liberty interests have been curtailed in accordance with that risk. It is therefore logical that a Board, in achieving the goals of public protection and fairness to the NCR accused, should have the power to supervise the medical treatment provided to the accused, since a major aim of that treatment is to reduce the accused’s safety risk and to provide the NCR with the maximum liberty possible.</p>

In so doing, a Board must be entitled to order a re-evaluation of current or past treatment approaches, and an exploration of alternatives where necessary — i.e., where no progress has been made or is likely to be made. Such supervisory powers are an inherent part of a Board’s mandate; if there is a treatment “impasse”, then a Board’s function could not be properly carried out unless it were able to impose conditions to deal with this lack of progress and to seek out more effective treatment opportunities. The role of a Board is to assess the risk to public safety posed by certain NCR accused persons, to provide opportunities for appropriate and effective medical treatment with a view to controlling and reducing that risk, to work towards the ultimate goal of rehabilitation and&nbsp; reintegration, and to safeguard the liberty interests of the accused in this process. These goals simply cannot be accomplished without accurate, independent, and up-to-date information on an accused’s mental condition, treatment plan, clinical progress, and prospects for rehabilitation. This justifies a Board’s power to supervise the medical treatment provided thus far, and to suggest or explore alternative approaches where necessary. Review Boards may therefore validly require hospital staff to re-examine a diagnosis or a treatment plan, and to consider alternatives which might be more effective or appropriate, — thus requiring hospital authorities to justify their position regarding any “treatment impasse”.</p>

As previously discussed, the composition of a Board ensures that there is a certain degree of expertise and experience amongst members with respect to psychiatric issues, especially in the context of a Board’s central risk assessment function. Parliament clearly intended Review Boards to have some expertise in assessing and managing the safety risks posed by some NCR accused persons. While this expertise and experience cannot justify actually prescribing medical treatment, it can help justify a Board’s supervisory power over treatment issues and the power to make orders and conditions “regarding” treatment; it is also consistent with the “wide latitude” and discretion accorded to a Board in the exercise of its functions (see <i>Winko</i>, at para. 27).</p>

For example, while the Manitoba Court of Appeal in <i>Wiebe</i> found that Review Boards do not have the power to prescribe medical services to be provided by hospital staff, it still accepted that Boards may validly make conditions regarding the supervision of the medical services actually provided (or not provided) to an NCR accused. In <i>Wiebe</i>, the treatment plan proposed to the Manitoba Review Board was effectively “for ‘no treatment,’ and nothing else” (para.&nbsp;31), because the physician treating the NCR accused essentially believed that the accused’s mental condition was not capable of treatment. The Court of Appeal found that in such cases, a Board could make conditions which question a given treatment plan, consistent with its supervisory jurisdiction, in order to ensure that the accused is not improperly denied opportunities for appropriate medical treatment. The Court of Appeal also summarized and appeared to endorse the Manitoba Board’s argument that there is “a <u>distinction</u> between the Board <u>considering</u> treatment — as it relates to the mental condition of the detainee or conditions proposed to be attached under sec. 672.54 — and <u>ordering</u> specific treatment”, and that the Board could accomplish the former, but not the latter (para. 30 (emphasis added)). The Court of Appeal in <i>Wiebe </i>ultimately sent the matter back to the Board, requiring it to consider not only the views of the accused’s current physician, but also the views and proposals to be submitted by other experts.</p>

Lewis</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 163 (P.E.I.S.C., App. Div.); <i>Beauchamp v. Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre</i> <i>(Administrator)</i> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 172 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Brockville Psychiatric Hospital v. McGillis</i> (1996), 2 C.R. (5th) 242 (Ont. C.A.), <i>Pinet</i> and <i>Penetanguishene</i>. The Director and the Attorney General of British Columbia argue that these cases do not support Mazzei’s position, since the conditions imposed by Review Boards in those cases were only concerned with the level of security for the detention of an NCR accused and with the liberty interests of the accused — not with treatment issues.</p>

I am of the view that the same result would and should have been reached in the cases cited by Mazzei if the impugned conditions had dealt specifically with the supervision of medical treatment. If it is accepted that the overall purpose and intent of the legislative scheme authorizes Review Boards to make orders and impose conditions concerning the level of security for the detention of the accused and restrictions on the accused’s liberty, and that such orders and conditions would be binding on hospital authorities, then orders and conditions related to (but not specifically prescribing) medical treatment would also be valid and binding on hospital authorities. This is because such treatment would be aimed at the overall purpose of the legislation (that is, protection of the public and maximization of liberty interests). Thus, the jurisprudence submitted by Mazzei tends to support the claim that Boards are empowered to make binding orders scrutinizing or supervising medical treatment.</p>

The B.C.C.A. confirmed that Part XX.1 “does not give the Board the authority to <u>diagnose and treat</u> an NCR accused or to <u>interfere</u> in his or her treatment plan”; but it went on to state that the legislation “gives the Board the power&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to <u>question the treatment the accused is receiving</u>” (para. 89 (emphasis added)).

The Director and the Attorney General of British Columbia generally argue that this provision prevents Review Boards from exercising such a power, preferring a narrow interpretation of the section. They argue that under s.&nbsp;672.55(1), if a treatment team recommends a certain treatment which the Board considers reasonable and necessary, and if the accused consents, then this treatment could be added as a condition to the disposition order. However, because this condition would merely be a way of helping the hospital staff to carry out its duties in treating the accused, it would not be “binding” on the Director, and would be subject to his or her discretionary authority. Mazzei also adopts a narrow interpretation of s. 672.55(1), but argues that it can have a wide application. Counsel for the appellant provided a hypothetical example. In deciding to move the accused from a situation of hospital detention to a conditional discharge order in the community, a Review Board could, for example, include a condition requiring the accused to continue taking his medication. This would be a valid condition as a result of s. 672.55(1), so long as the accused consented to the condition and so long as the Board considered it reasonable and necessary. Counsel for the appellant seemed to suggest that this would amount to a commitment on the part of the accused to continue a particular course of treatment (which was started in the hospital) while under conditional release in the community (given that he would no longer be subject to the hospital’s jurisdiction and authority). This commitment would be given in consideration for the increase in liberty contemplated by the Board, rather than as an actual “prescription” for “treatment” ordered by the Board. As such, Mazzei does not argue that s. 672.55(1) justifies the reading in of a power to prescribe treatment within s. 672.54, but is instead a “stand alone section” with a specific purpose and application. The intervener Board favours a wider interpretation of s. 672.55(1), but a narrow&nbsp; application. In his oral submissions, counsel for the Board argued that this provision actually allows the Board to prescribe or order medical treatment for an NCR accused if the three preconditions (consent, necessity, and reasonableness) are met, as an exception to the general prohibition against ordering or prescribing treatment. However, counsel for the Board submitted that this power should only be used very rarely, if at all, and the Board’s experience in practice has confirmed that it invokes s. 672.55(1) very infrequently.</p>

If it does, then it can be said that Review Boards do have the power to order or prescribe treatment for an NCR accused where the three preconditions are satisfied (consent, necessity and reasonableness); if not, then Boards can never go so far as to order treatment, though they may exercise “supervisory” powers over treatment decisions, as discussed above. In my view, the second part of s. 672.55(1) is not a true exception to the prohibition against ordering treatment, and merely represents an example or manifestation of the Board’s supervisory power over treatment.</p>

The first part of s. 672.55(1) reinforces the general prohibition: “No disposition&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall direct that any psychiatric or other treatment of the accused be carried out or that the accused submit to such treatment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”. The second part of the provision introduces a new idea: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<u>except that</u> the disposition <u>may include a condition regarding</u>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. treatment where the accused has consented to the condition and the court or Review Board considers the condition to be reasonable and necessary in the interests of the accused”.&nbsp; If this second part was meant to act as a true exception to the general prohibition in the first part, the wording would&nbsp; have been much clearer. For example, Parliament could have used one of the following versions:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Either of these alternatives would have clearly indicated that Parliament wished to establish a specific exception to the general prohibition against ordering or prescribing treatment, so long as the elements of consent, necessity and reasonableness are present.</p>

Whereas the first part of the provision prohibits a disposition <i>order</i> from “direct[ing]” that treatment “be carried out” or that the accused “submit” to treatment, the second part specifies that a disposition order may “include” a “condition <u>regarding</u>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. treatment”. In my view, the language in the first part clearly prohibits direct action by the Board to order or prescribe treatment, while the second part refers to treatment in a more indirect manner, and is more consistent with or reflective of the Board’s supervisory power over treatment decisions, as discussed above. If Parliament did not intend a “condition regarding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. treatment” to be somehow distinct from an order directing that treatment be carried out or that the accused submit to treatment, the actual wording of s. 672.55(1) would in effect be unnecessarily awkward and redundant, especially where much clearer and simpler formulations exist, as noted above. In my view, the precise wording selected by Parliament is significant and relevant, and the interpretation of s. 672.55(1) should reflect that specific legislative distinction.</p>

As well, where Parliament has intended for treatment to be specifically imposed or prescribed in respect of an accused, it has used different wording and a different operational scheme. For example, s. 672.58 deals with the power of a court (but not a Review Board) to: “<u>on application by the prosecutor</u>, by <u>order</u>, <u>direct</u> that treatment of the accused be carried out for a specified period not exceeding sixty days&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [or] that the accused submit to that treatment <u>by the person or at the hospital specified</u>” for an accused person found “unfit to stand trial”. It is noteworthy that such an order can only be made for the purpose of rendering the accused fit to stand trial (s. 672.59(1)), and that it must be undertaken with the consent of the person responsible for administering the treatment (s. 672.62(1)), and if necessary, without the consent of the accused (s. 672.62(2)). In the absence of such explicit statutory language and operational structure, the second part of s. 672.55(1) cannot be seen as providing a true “exception” to the general prohibition found in the first part of the section. Furthermore, while the prohibition in the first part of s. 672.55(1) clearly contemplates medical treatment in the form of drugs or therapies recommended, approved, delivered and supervised by hospital staff, the second part of s. 672.55(1) arguably refers to a “commitment” by the accused himself to <i>continue</i> a certain course of treatment, while in the community, which was undertaken or recommended while still under hospital detention, as suggested in the hypothetical illustration provided by counsel for the appellant. This commitment to continue a certain course of treatment, as a condition to be fulfilled in order to achieve an increase in liberty (by moving from hospital detention to conditional discharge in the community, for example), is not equivalent in nature or in scope to prescribing or ordering that medical treatment be provided by health professionals, which is specifically prohibited by the first part of s.&nbsp;672.55(1). The second part of the section refers to “treatment” only in the sense of the accused’s own commitment to continue a certain course of treatment in the community, when he or she is no longer subject to the hospital’s jurisdiction or authority.</p>

This interpretation of s. 672.55(1) is consistent with the distinction established earlier between “prescribing” treatment and “supervising” treatment decisions; by allowing Boards to include a condition “regarding” treatment where the accused consents and where the Board considers it to be reasonable and necessary, the second part of s. 672.55(1) in effect constitutes one example or manifestation of the Board’s supervisory powers under s. 672.54. Those supervisory powers are not solely grounded in or dependent upon s. 672.55(1); as explained above, they derive from a consideration of the Board’s role and mandate, the structure and wording of the legislative scheme as a whole, the legislative purpose, and Parliament’s intent as interpreted and developed in the jurisprudence.</p>

Review Boards will likely resort to this power to include conditions “regarding” treatment only rarely and in specific situations, where for example the Board is contemplating a significant decrease in the restraints on an accused’s liberty which is effectively conditional upon him or her committing to continue a particular course of treatment (which was already undertaken or approved by the hospital treatment team while the accused was subject to a hospital detention order) while in the community. The purpose of requiring such a commitment is to ensure that the accused’s threat to public safety is appropriately managed while in the community, given that he is no longer under the hospital’s supervision. This means that the power to include a condition “regarding” treatment under s. 672.55(1) does not eliminate, reduce or ignore any discretionary authority of the Director or other relevant hospital authority. In the example provided by counsel for the appellant, the Board could validly order Mazzei to continue taking his medication (if he consents, and if it is reasonable and necessary), but it is implicit that such medication would already have been recommended, approved and/or implemented by the Director during the accused’s hospital detention. That is, the Board would merely be ordering Mazzei to continue a course of treatment already approved by the relevant hospital authority; the Board would not be able to itself decide on a new course of treatment or prescribe therapy which had not been part of Mazzei’s treatment plan during his hospital detention. Thus, the discretionary authority of the Director has not been undermined, but is rather confirmed and respected. In essence then, the limited power to make a condition “regarding” treatment under s. 672.55(1) is merely a reflection of the Board continuing to fulfill its mandate to provide “opportunities for treatment” in situations where the accused is in the community and no longer under the supervision of a provincial health authority. One might ask why Parliament would have chosen to adopt s. 672.55(1) if supervisory powers were already provided for. In my view, this provision was meant to specify that supervisory powers continue even where treatment plans are at issue, but that they must not override the powers and responsibilities of the Director to prescribe treatment as such.</p>

In light of the legislative scheme and the Board’s mandate discussed above, how should these conditions be characterized? As valid requests for information under the Board’s supervisory powers, or as an invalid interference with the Director’s treatment decisions? I am of the view that all three conditions constitute valid exercises of the Board’s power to request information for the assessment and management of Mazzei’s safety risk, and its power to supervise his treatment, including the scrutiny of past approaches and the exploration of alternatives. Furthermore, all three conditions were “reasonable” given the circumstances of this case and the evidence before the Board at Mazzei’s hearing.</p>

This condition falls squarely within the Board’s authority to “question the treatment the accused is receiving”, as acknowledged by the B.C.C.A. (at para. 89), and to require the Director to reconsider the current treatment plan and to explore alternative approaches which may be more appropriate or effective for Mazzei. There is nothing in this condition which prescribes treatment or which interferes with the medical services approved and implemented by the Director and hospital staff; nor does this condition interfere with the Director’s ultimate discretion and authority with respect to the specific treatment provided to Mazzei;&nbsp; it merely requires the Director to reconsider the approach taken thus far and to explore other options given the apparent failure of the current approach. It does, however, represent a clear and acceptable limit on the Director’s ability to act as the sole judge of the efficacy of a treatment approach, and as a valid exercise of the Board’s supervisory powers over the provision of opportunities for appropriate medical treatment.</p>

In fulfilling this mandate, the Board is required to gather accurate information in order to assess Mazzei’s risk to public safety. This is reflected in the factors enumerated in s. 672.54, such as the need to consider “the mental condition of the accused”. Requiring the Director to undertake a review of past and current treatment approaches, and the reasons for the apparent “impasse”, is consistent with this scheme. It is a supervisory power which is incidental and necessary to the Board’s mandate to obtain all necessary information it requires in order to arrive at an accurate assessment of an accused’s risk to public safety and prospects for community reintegration. Forming its own opinion on the appropriateness or efficacy of a particular treatment plan is a necessary component of this power.</p>

One possible objection to this condition is that it implies that the Director must actually submit a new “refocussed” treatment plan in light of the Board’s dissatisfaction with the current approach as indicated in condition 8; this would arguably move condition 9 closer to the kind of invalid condition actually prescribing treatment. However, this condition must also be interpreted in light of the Board’s statutory mandate and the need to gather relevant information in order to craft an appropriate disposition. Independent advice would be justified in light of the aforementioned treatment impasse. The Board must be entitled to demand new independent information to be provided where there is a significant difference of opinion between the accused and the treatment team with respect to the current approach, and an apparent breakdown in communication and trust.&nbsp; Thus, in ordering an independent assessment of Mazzei’s threat to public safety, in light of the failure of past treatment approaches and the prospect of new alternative options, the Board was clearly exercising a valid power to supervise the progress of Mazzei’s rehabilitation.</p>

This condition is perhaps the most controversial in that it comes closest to “prescribing” treatment. However, upon closer inspection, condition 10 is still clearly within the Board’s jurisdictional authority, since it is more in the nature of an order requiring the Director to explore new possibilities and consider their effectiveness. The Director is being asked to seriously investigate the possibility of enrolling Mazzei in a culturally appropriate treatment program; in this context, “undertak[ing] assertive efforts” would arguably include making inquiries with those who administer the program in question, consulting with the person in charge of the program, performing an assessment of the likelihood of eligibility and enrolment, etc. Condition 10 is therefore consistent with the Director’s obligation to provide accurate and relevant information to the Board, and to investigate and provide opportunities for appropriate medical treatment. The wording of the condition merely requires the Director to “undertake assertive <u>efforts</u>” (emphasis added) to enroll Mazzei in a culturally appropriate treatment program; it falls short of specifically prescribing such enrollment. The Director is merely asked to obtain more information on appropriate programs and on Mazzei’s eligibility.</p>

All parties appear to have agreed that a culturally appropriate treatment program would likely be beneficial to Mazzei; the only dispute was over who should bear the responsibility for exploring this option. Requiring the Director to seriously investigate culturally appropriate treatment does not remove or undermine the Director’s discretionary authority over Mazzei’s clinical progress. All the Director is being asked to do is to undertake “assertive efforts”. If the Director can demonstrate that such efforts were undertaken, but ultimately feels that Mazzei does not belong in such a program or would not benefit from it, or that a more appropriate treatment course already exists within the Hospital, then the Board will have to be satisfied with this position (unless, of course, the Board considers that position unreasonable, according to the circumstances and according to the evidence before it, as per its supervisory powers over treatment decisions, discussed above). So long as the Director complies with the Board’s order, and demonstrates that culturally appropriate treatment has been explored and that efforts were made to consider Mazzei’s enrolment, then the Board would not be able to go further in asserting its powers. The Director would still retain a discretionary authority over Mazzei’s treatment and clinical progress, subject to the Board’s supervision when necessary, but nonetheless free from actual interference by the Board.</p>

In my view, all three conditions were reasonable in that they were amply supported and justified by the facts, the circumstances, and the available evidence at the Board hearing.</p>

The Board’s decision to seek out a global review (in condition 8) was primarily motivated by its frustration with the lack of progress made in respect of Mazzei’s treatment plan and rehabilitation efforts, regardless of who bore the blame for this impasse. It was also a direct response to the perceived lack of information on Mazzei’s mental condition, and to the inability of his case manager to answer the Board’s questions with respect to medical issues (see Board’s decision, at p. 2). Likewise, the new risk assessment contemplated in condition 9 was motivated by the apparent impasse in Mazzei’s clinical progress, and by the Board’s frustration with the lack of accurate and useful information available to it at the hearing, as evidenced by the late reports filed by the treatment team and the absence of Mazzei’s supervising psychiatrist at the hearing (see Board’s decision, at p. 2). This frustration was compounded by the significant difference of opinion between the Director and Mazzei on who should bear the blame for the stalled clinical progress. In addition, the decision to explore a First Nations residential rehabilitation program in condition 10 also reflects the Board’s duty to provide “opportunities for <u>appropriate</u> treatment” (see <i>Winko</i>,<i> </i>at para. 43 (emphasis added)), and its obligation to consider the “other needs” of the accused when crafting a disposition order under s. 672.54. Such “other needs” would arguably include the need for treatment which is culturally appropriate and responsive to an accused’s aboriginal culture and heritage.</p>

Review Boards have the power to make conditions regarding the provision and supervision of medical treatment, and to make such conditions binding on other parties such as hospital authorities. This power is justified by the statutory role and mandate of Review Boards; yet it is a limited&nbsp; mandate, since Review Boards cannot go so far as to actually prescribe or impose medical treatment, or require hospital authorities to deliver that treatment. However, conditions 8, 9 and 10 in the present case do not exceed these limits, as they constitute valid exercises of the Board’s supervisory role in providing opportunities for appropriate medical treatment, and in fulfilling the goals of Part XX.1 — protecting the public and safeguarding the liberty interests of the accused. As well, all three conditions were reasonable and supported by the evidence available to the Board at Mazzei’s April 3, 2002 hearing. <span lang="EN-GB">Because the three conditions were overtaken by subsequent Board orders, the central issue in this appeal is moot, and there is therefore no practical remedy for the appellant. No costs were sought by the parties, and no costs award should be made.</span></p>
