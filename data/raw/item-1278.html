Shortly thereafter, the accused called C from the intercom outside the lobby and asked him to "come down".&nbsp; Before leaving his apartment C unlocked the building front door.&nbsp; B and the accused went into the lobby and, when C arrived, he was grabbed by B.&nbsp; After some discussion, B pushed C away and shot him. The accused stated that he had repeatedly pleaded with B not to shoot C.&nbsp; C, however, testified that during the incident the accused said nothing and made no effort to intervene.&nbsp; After the shooting, B drove the accused away from the scene of the shooting.&nbsp; According to the accused's testimony, B then threatened to kill him if he went to the police.&nbsp; The next morning the accused turned himself in.&nbsp; Under cross‑examination, he declared that he believed that he had had no opportunity to run away or warn C without being shot.&nbsp; In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that "if [the accused] joined in the common plot to shoot [C], under threats of death or grievous bodily harm, that would negative his having a common intention with [B] to shoot [C], and you must find [the accused] not guilty".&nbsp; He added that "the accused [could] not rely on [the common law defence of duress] if a safe avenue of escape exist[ed], which .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a matter for you to find when you consider the evidence".&nbsp; The accused was acquitted of the charge of attempted murder, but was convicted of the included offence of aggravated assault.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The significance of this comment in terms of the judgment as a whole is rather difficult to determine.&nbsp; Martland J. had earlier endorsed the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland&nbsp; v. Lynch</i>, [1975] A.C. 653, in which a majority of the House of Lords had clearly taken the view that the common law defence of duress provided an <u>excuse</u>, rather than operating by negating <i>mens rea. </i>Thus, Martland J. evidently did not intend to suggest that duress provides a defence at common law <u>only</u> when the accused’s culpable mental state can be said to have been "negated".&nbsp; Instead, he appears to have been holding out an alternative route by which a person charged as a party under s. 21(2) could escape criminal liability, distinct from the "defence of duress" <i>per se</i> -- that is, a "defence" founded not on concepts of excuse or justification, but based instead on the absence of an essential element of the offence.</span></p>

Whether or not he or she <u>desires</u> the occurrence of these consequences will depend on the particular circumstances.&nbsp; For example, a person who is forced at gunpoint to drive a group of armed ruffians to a bank will usually know that the likely result of his or her actions will be that an attempt will be made to rob the bank, but he or she may not desire this result -- indeed, he or she may strongly wish that the robbers' plans are ultimately foiled, if this could occur without risk to his or her own safety.&nbsp; In contrast, a person who is told that his or her child is being held hostage at another location and will be killed unless the robbery is successful will almost certainly have an active subjective desire that the robbery succeed.&nbsp; While the existence of threats clearly has a bearing on the <u>motive</u> underlying each actor’s respective decision to assist in the robbery, only the first actor can be said not to <u>desire&nbsp;</u>that the robbery take place, and neither actor can be said not to have knowledge of the consequences of their actions. To determine whether <i>mens rea</i> is "negated" in a particular case, therefore, the first question that must be asked is whether the mental element of the offence in question is defined in such a way that either an actor’s motives or his or her immediate desires have any direct relevance.&nbsp; As A.

(as he then was) in <i>New Brunswick v. Estabrooks Pontiac Buick Ltd.</i> (1982), 44 N.B.R. (2d) 201, at p. 210, "[t]he fact that the words as interpreted would give an unreasonable result...is certainly ground for the courts to scrutinize a statute carefully to make abundantly certain that those words are not susceptible of another interpretation".&nbsp; In my view, the absurdity that would flow from the equation of "purpose" with "desire" cannot legitimately be ascribed to Parliamentary intention. This serves to cast considerable doubt on the correctness of this interpretation of the word "purpose" in this context, especially when one recalls that there exists an alternative interpretation of the word that can just as accurately be said to reflect its "plain meaning", under which this absurdity would be avoided.</span></p>

While in many cases an aider who actively desires the commission of the offence he or she aids will not be able to legitimately claim that he or she acted under duress, this will not inevitably be so (consider, for instance, the hypothetical example, discussed earlier, of the parent whose child is held hostage by confederates of robbers, who is told that the child will be released unharmed only if he or she&nbsp; assists in the <u>successful</u> commission of a robbery).&nbsp; Consequently, in at least some cases juries would be forced to consider two alternate legal routes leading to an acquittal by reason of duress.&nbsp; This complication would, however, have little or no practical effect, since there will be few, if any, cases involving parties in which a "defence" of "negation of <i>mens rea </i>by duress" would succeed where recourse to the excuse-based common law defence of duress would not also lead to an acquittal.&nbsp; As Professor D. Stuart observes (<i>Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise</i> (3rd ed. 1995)), introducing the notion of duress "negating" <i>mens rea</i> into the analysis serves only to muddy the conceptual waters.&nbsp; As he points out (at p. 420):</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">There is, of course, an obvious distinction between duress and necessity as potential defences; duress arises from the wrongful threats or violence of another human being and necessity arises from any other objective dangers threatening the accused.&nbsp; This, however, is, in my view a distinction without a relevant difference, since on this view&nbsp; duress is only that species of the genus of necessity which is caused by wrongful threats.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">In contrast, a distinction can be drawn between self-defence, on the one hand, and duress and necessity, on the other, that might well provide a basis for a meaningful juridical difference. In cases of self-defence, the victim of the otherwise criminal act at issue is himself or herself the <u>originator</u> of the threat that causes the actor to commit what would otherwise be an assault or culpable homicide (bearing in mind, of course, that the victim's threats may themselves have been provoked by the conduct of the accused).&nbsp; In this sense, he or she is the author of his or her own deserts, a factor which arguably warrants special consideration in the law.&nbsp; In cases of duress and necessity, however, the victims of the otherwise criminal act (to the extent that a victim can be identified) are <u>third parties</u>, who are not themselves responsible for the threats or circumstances of necessity that motivated the accused’s actions.&nbsp; For this reason, analogies between the defence of necessity and duress would appear to be the most clearly supportable, and thus the most likely to be instructive.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">In Canada, of course, a distinction between the two defences exists as a result of the fact that the defence of duress has been partially codified (in relation to principals) by s. 17, while necessity remains a purely common law defence: <i>Perka v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232.&nbsp; In the present case, however, we are concerned only with those cases of duress falling outside the ambit of s. 17, where the common law remains applicable -- that is, cases of party liability (<i>Paquette</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; In my view, the clear similarities between the factual circumstances in which the common law defence of duress and the common law defence of necessity arise imply that comparisons between the two remain highly relevant, notwithstanding the existence of a partially codified version of the defence of duress applicable in other situations.&nbsp; It would, I believe, be highly anomalous if the common law defence of duress were to be understood as based on substantially different juridical principles from the common law defence of necessity.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">He went on to reject this basis for the defence.&nbsp; Instead, he adopted an understanding of the defence of necessity based on the alternative concept of an "excuse".&nbsp; As he declared (at pp. 248-49):</span></p>

D. Ross, 1975, at p. 49)] "overstrains human nature and which no one could withstand".</span></p>

P. Fletcher in his treatise <i>Rethinking Criminal Law</i> (1978).&nbsp; In Fletcher’s view, excuses in criminal law can best be understood as rooted in the notion of "moral or normative involuntariness".&nbsp; Dickson J. approved of this theoretical foundation for excuses, stating (at p. 250):</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Mena</i> (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 304, at p. 319), "in a somewhat unsatisfactory state" at the time.&nbsp; With the greatest of respect, I am of the view that his charge to the jury contained several instructions that, when read with reference to the law as set out in this Court’s current decision, now can be identified as incorrect.&nbsp; In his charge, the trial judge told the jurors that "if Hibbert joined in the common plot to shoot Cohen, under threats of death or grievous bodily harm, that would negative his having a common intention with Quasi to shoot Cohen, and [<i>sic</i>] you must find Hibbert&nbsp; not guilty". In my respectful view, these instructions contained several errors.&nbsp; First, the reference to "common intention"-- an expression descriptive of the mental element in s. 21(2) -- was misplaced, in light of the trial judge’s earlier instruction that s. 21(1)(<i>b</i>) was "the portion of s. 21 that applies to this particular case".&nbsp; Second, as I have explained, it was incorrect to instruct the jury that the <i>mens rea</i> for party liability under s. 21(1)(<i>b</i>) could be "negated" by duress.&nbsp; Thirdly, and most importantly, the jury was not told that even if the appellant possessed the requisite <i>mens rea</i> his conduct could be <u>excused</u> by operation of the common law defence of duress, if the jurors were of the view that the necessary conditions for this defence’s application were present.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">To aid the commission of a crime, a person must associate himself with the criminal venture by participating in it and trying to make it succeed</span></u><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">.&nbsp; Remember, it is no criminal offence to stand by.&nbsp; A mere passive spectator to a crime no matter how serious the offence, is not guilty of the offence.&nbsp; <u>There must be an intentional assistance of the crime for the accused to be guilty of aiding</u>.&nbsp; In order for you to find the accused guilty on the basis of aiding, it is not sufficient for the Crown to prove that his acts or omissions, in fact, had the effect of aiding the commission of the crime.&nbsp; The Crown must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt <u>that he did the acts, or he omitted to do something for the purpose of, or with the intention of, aiding the commission of the crime</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">This instruction clearly communicated to the jurors that, in the context of s. 21(1)(<i>b</i>), "purpose" was synonymous with "intention".&nbsp; I hasten to add that in this respect the trial judge’s instructions were, as I have explained, perfectly correct; however, in light of these correct instructions on the issue of <i>mens rea</i> it cannot be said that the erroneous instructions on duress had no effect on the jury’s verdict.&nbsp; It is quite possible that the jury determined that the appellant aided the assault "intentionally", in the sense that he performed acts that he knew would probably assist Bailey to commit the assault because he believed that if he did not Bailey would kill him.&nbsp; The jurors might have thus concluded that the appellant’s <i>mens rea</i> was not "negated" by duress, under circumstances in which they might well have&nbsp; concluded that his conduct could be <u>excused</u> if they had been aware of the existence of the common law defence of duress, properly conceptualized.</span></p>
