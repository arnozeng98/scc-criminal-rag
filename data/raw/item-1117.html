The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions.&nbsp; The issue in this Court is whether the trial judge's editing of the affidavits prevented a proper and full inquiry into the validity of the authorizations, thereby depriving the accused of the right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">ss. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">d<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

In editing out from the same affidavits information that had not been edited by the other judge, and was therefore public, the trial judge ignored the basic rule of non‑disclosure that it is only confidential information that qualifies.&nbsp; Furthermore, the trial judge excised not only information which might tend to identify informants, but also information obtained from informants and others, and material which he characterized as "commentary", "summary" or "opinion".&nbsp; Editing is to be kept to a minimum and this principle clearly was not respected in this case.&nbsp; Given the conclusion that the trial judge did not comply with the principles set out in <i>Parmar</i>, subsequently approved of by this Court in <i>Garofoli</i>, in determining what to edit, it is unnecessary to decide whether or not the procedure adopted by the trial judge in editing the affidavits was in accordance with the procedure suggested by the authorities.</span></p>

In balancing the interests of the accused and the public interest in the administration of justice, the trial judge deleted information from informers from the affidavits on the basis that such information was likely to lead to their identification.&nbsp; In so doing, the trial judge was perhaps overly cautious in his attempt to protect the identity of the informers and the nature of the undercover operation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this was within his discretion and could not amount to an error of law in the absence of a denial of justice or of full and fair defence.</span></p>

The grounds of appeal did not reveal any miscarriage of justice and were worded in pure legal technicalities which have no bearing on the innocence or the guilt of the accused.</span></p>

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505.&nbsp; This is explicitly recognized in s. 187(5) which now states that the accused "shall" be given a copy of the material in the packet once it has been edited by the prosecutor.</span></p>

Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont.&nbsp;C.A.), at p. 43.&nbsp;&nbsp; The present case provides a convenient opportunity to add that the need for editing should not be presumed.</span></p>

Egger</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at pp. 466-67.&nbsp; This may be done by showing that the public interest in non-disclosure outweighs the accused's interest in disclosure.&nbsp; However, I agree with the following statement by Doherty J.A., at p. 466:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">Apart from public interest concerns which may operate in a particular case, I see no reason why an accused should not be entitled to see exactly what the judge saw who relied on the affidavits to issue the authorization.&nbsp; Disclosure of the full affidavit should be the starting premise.&nbsp; Anything less potentially impairs an accused's ability to make full answer and defence and must be justified by the Crown in accordance with established principles.&nbsp; Editing of these affidavits is best viewed as a necessary evil.</span></p>

Ct. J.'s decision on the appellants' <i>Wilson</i> application, challenging the wiretap authorizations on the sole ground that the trial judge edited too much of the affidavits provided to the judge who authorized the wiretaps.&nbsp; On September 10, 1987, this application was dismissed by Watt J.: <i>R. v. Durette</i> (1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 590, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 126.&nbsp; According to Watt J., O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. did not err in finding that the edited affidavits set out probable and reasonable grounds sufficient to support the issuance of the authorizations neither did he exceed his jurisdiction nor breach the rules of natural justice in limiting the scope of the cross-examination, determining whether certain persons should be cross-examined and whether certain evidence sought to be admitted ought to be received as relevant.</span></p>

Garcia</i>, 618 A.2d 326 (1993), the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that, under a disposition creating an "official information privilege" (<i>Rules of Evidence</i>, N.J.S.A. 2A:84A, Rule 34), the State of New Jersey could not disclose to an accused the location from which police conducted surveillance of criminal activity.&nbsp; The court was concerned with the safety of ongoing police operations.&nbsp; Clifford J., for the court, made the following observations (at p. 330) which are apposite in the context of wiretapping where the safety of ongoing criminal investigations and police investigation techniques are equally at stake:</span></p>

(at p. 448), when the trial judge announced his intent to edit the affidavits on his own, the appellants' counsel did not object to the proposed procedure.&nbsp; Moreover, O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. closely followed each step of the editing methodology recommended by Watt J. in <i>Parmar (No. 1)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 281-82, which was the law at the time.&nbsp; O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. granted the appellants' application and opened the <u>nine</u> sealed packets, although <u>seven</u> were asked for, including therefore the seven District Court authorizations and the two Supreme Court of Ontario authorizations.&nbsp; At a time when the onus on the reasons for access to the contents of the sealed packet was controversial, he did not require the appellants to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of fraud or any other preconditions in order to obtain access to the sealed packets.&nbsp; He opened the nine sealed packets, removed the affidavits and edited them himself and gave a copy of the nine edited affidavits to the Crown for review.&nbsp; O'Connell Dist.

Ct. J. did, as he stated in his reasons.&nbsp; He had the discretion to edit, and such discretion demanded, in his view, that he edit to the extent he did, in order to delete information regarding informers on the basis that such information was likely to lead to their identification.&nbsp; Perhaps in so doing the editing judge was over-cautious in his attempt to protect the identity of the informers and the nature of the undercover operation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this was within his discretion and could not amount to an error of law in the absence of a denial of justice or of full and fair defence.&nbsp; </span></p>

Ct. J.&nbsp; Whatever the merits of that position, I note that counsel for the appellants had the opportunity to present their submissions over the course of two days with respect to the editing O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. had done (May 19 and 20, 1987).&nbsp; The arguments of counsel for the appellants were, at that time, only directed towards the deletion of information from informers, as opposed to information identifying informers, and the specific issue of possible loss of confidentiality of some informers was never raised.&nbsp; This is significant in my view and the appellants cannot today, without more, challenge such editing.&nbsp; At the time of the editing, the trial had not been held and there was no way for the trial judge to know whether, at the time of trial, such confidentiality would become unnecessary.&nbsp; Besides, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the reviewing judge was informed that the material in the affidavits edited out by Bowlby J. was not, or had ceased to be, confidential and, therefore, could be released.&nbsp; Contrary to what my colleague Sopinka J. holds, I am of the opinion that the reviewing judge could not have presumed, at&nbsp; the time of his review, that the version of the affidavits as edited and released by Bowlby J. was not confidential anymore.&nbsp; The appellants' argument cannot succeed.</span></p>

Ct. J. may be more questionable, as my colleague Sopinka J. notes.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these deletions were minor and are irrelevant as a basis for the issuing of the authorizations.&nbsp; As Finlayson J.A. pointed out, that "is&nbsp; but one opinion, however, and is not enough to override that of an experienced trial judge" (p. 450).&nbsp; Moreover, this falls within the trial judge's discretion and surely it is not enough to constitute unfairness and warrant a new trial, especially considering all the circumstances of this case and, in particular, in respect with the editing process, the lengthy cross-examination of the affiants and of two additional witnesses (12 days).&nbsp; The appellants had every opportunity to explore the veracity of the affidavits and the probable cause for requesting (and granting) the authorizations in the first place.&nbsp; That is the important issue.</span></p>

Ct. J. specifically indicated that the only deletions he made were related to the identity of informers and some irrelevant commentary.&nbsp; If that is so, it is entirely proper and in accordance with <i>Garofoli</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; I note that the reasons of O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. were not challenged.</span></p>

Marsh</i>, <i>supra</i>) and the same two affidavits edited by Watt J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario in the second <i>Wilson</i> motion presented in September 1987 with the editing made by O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. is not relevant.&nbsp; In the exercise of their discretion, judges might hold different views and come to different conclusions.&nbsp; As long as the exercise of discretion is made judiciously and judicially, there is no ground for reproach.&nbsp; This is the case here.&nbsp; There is no magic formula and the circumstances of a particular case will mandate certain courses of action.&nbsp; Judgment and common sense will have to be exercised.&nbsp; One may have a different view than another, but that is the name of the game of discretion, providing fundamental rules of justice are respected.&nbsp; Dickson J.'s comments in <i>Rathwell v. Rathwell</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 436, although in the context of matrimonial property disputes, are relevant to the present matter (at p. 448):</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On balance, I do not think the appellants Farinacci, Lépine and Jeffreys can show significant prejudice as a result of the editing process. &nbsp;In the absence of such prejudice, the failure of the trial judge to fully anticipate guidelines that would be set down by subsequent courts for editing affidavits is not sufficient, on appeal, to set aside the authorizations in question.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Even assuming that the deletions made by the trial judge were excessive to the point of amounting to an error, no prejudice resulting from those deletions was demonstrated.&nbsp; Moreover, the judge allowed cross-examination of the three affiants and two additional witnesses for 12 full days.&nbsp; The appellants were unable to demonstrate that the authorizations to intercept private communications were facially deficient, that the edited affidavits failed to set out reasonable and probable grounds or that the affiants committed fraud, misleading disclosure or non-disclosure in their request for the authorizations to wiretap appellants' telephone conversations.&nbsp; Besides, as I said earlier, counsel for the appellants recognized that had the affidavits submitted to the judge in order to obtain the wiretap authorizations been the <u>edited</u> affidavits, such affidavits would have been <u>sufficient</u> for the issuing of the authorizations.&nbsp; In these circumstances, I cannot find prejudice.&nbsp; The purpose of a review is precisely to ascertain that the authorizations were properly issued, not to permit the accused to go on fishing expeditions to attempt to identify informers, which would be an abuse of the process in itself.&nbsp; The exercise that the appellants went through here, to no avail in my view, had the effect of considerably prolonging the proceedings, at a very substantial cost to the justice system. &nbsp;This, in my opinion, is only commendable when there is ground to suspect that rights have been violated and a miscarriage of justice has been committed; the grounds of appeal here at issue did not reveal any.&nbsp; They were worded in pure legal technicalities which have no bearing on the innocence or the guilt of an accused and, for that matter, on the rendering of justice.</span></p>
