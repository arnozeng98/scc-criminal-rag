 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In this case, the judge was justified in commencing contempt of court proceedings using the summary procedure and in citing the accused for contempt, since that was an appropriate method of preserving the authority of the court.&nbsp; However, the judge erred by combining the citation and conviction in a single proceeding.&nbsp; He was not justified in convicting the accused <i>instanter</i> and thereby depriving him of the procedural guarantees to which he was entitled, since the circumstances were not such that it was urgent and imperative to act immediately.&nbsp; The real question, however, concerns the consequences that the error had for the trial.&nbsp; The judge erred in exercising his discretion in that there was an inherent risk in the procedure adopted that the jury would misunderstand the meaning of the conviction for contempt and interpret it as representing the judge’s opinion of the accused’s credibility in relation to the substance of his defence. &nbsp;An adjournment was required to ensure that the judge used only the least possible power adequate to the end proposed in the exercise of his discretion. </span></p>

Any error which occurs at trial that deprives the accused of that entitlement is a miscarriage of justice. It is not every error which will result in a miscarriage of justice, the very existence of the proviso to relieve against errors of law which do not cause a miscarriage of justice recognizes that fact. However, I am not able to say that an error which, in the words of Brooke J.A., “could only unfairly prejudice”, would not by itself cause a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; It would be wholly inconsistent with a finding of unfair prejudice in a trial to find, nonetheless, that no miscarriage of justice occurred.</p>

Jolivet</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, 2000 SCC 29).&nbsp; The appellant did not suffer any prejudice as a result of the irregularities, and they did not affect the fairness of the trial in such a way as to justify a new trial.</p>
