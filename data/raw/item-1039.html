J. held that the first two branches of the offence had been established by the Crown; the unlawful act in question was trafficking in a narcotic as set out in s. 4(1) of the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>, and the cause of death was unrelated to any negligence in performing the unlawful act.&nbsp; With respect to the third branch, he stated:&nbsp; "in my respectful view, the `dangerousness' must be assessed on an objective standard", citing <i>R. v. Larkin</i> (1942), 29 Cr. App. R. 18 (C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Church</i> (1965), 49 Cr. App. R. 206 (C.C.A.); <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Newbury</i> (1976), 62 Cr.

Tutton</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, and <i>R. v. Waite</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1436, had evenly divided on whether the <i>mens rea</i> for criminal negligence is to be determined by an objective or subjective test.&nbsp; Locke Dist. Ct.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">There are two main branches to the analysis of social stigma.&nbsp; First the court must look to the conduct being punished to determine if it is of sufficient gravity to import significant moral opprobrium on the individual found guilty of engaging in such conduct.&nbsp; In the case of manslaughter under s. 222(5)(<i>a</i>), the conduct in question consists of killing someone as a consequence of committing an unlawful act.&nbsp; In this respect, there may well be no difference between the <i>actus reus</i> of manslaughter and that of murder; arguably both give rise to the stigma of being labelled by the state and the community as responsible for the wrongful death of another.&nbsp; Clearly, there can be no conduct in our society more grave than taking the life of another without justification.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The second branch of the stigma test concerns the moral blameworthiness not of the offence, but of the offender found guilty of committing it.&nbsp; As a general proposition, more stigma will attach to those who knowingly engage in wrongful conduct than to those who recklessly or inadvertently engage in the same conduct.&nbsp; As I stated in <i>R. v. Martineau</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at pp. 645-46:</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Human frailties encompass personal characteristics habitually affecting an accused's awareness of the circumstances which create risk.&nbsp; Such characteristics must be relevant to the ability to perceive the particular risk.&nbsp; For example, while illiteracy may excuse the failure to take care with a hazardous substance identifiable only by a label, as the accused may be unable, in this case, to apprehend the relevant facts, illiteracy may not be relevant to the failure to take care with a firearm.&nbsp; This attention to the context of the offence and the nature of the activity is explored in greater detail below.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">It should be emphasized that the relevant characteristics must be traits which the accused could not control or otherwise manage in the circumstances.&nbsp; For example, while a person with cataracts cannot be faulted for having reduced vision, he or she may be expected to avoid activity in which that limitation will either create risk or render him or her unable to manage risk which is inherent in an activity (driving, for example).&nbsp; The reasonable person is expected to compensate for his or her frailties, to the extent he or she is conscious of them and able to do so.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">This general discussion is not intended to set out an exhaustive definition, but rather to lay the groundwork for examining the different factual contexts which may arise.&nbsp; Two central criteria in this regard are (1) the gravity of the offence, and (2) the inherent purposefulness of the conduct involved. &nbsp;With respect to the gravity of the offence, there may be a significant gulf between neglecting to safely store a bottle containing a prescription drug, and neglecting to unload a firearm and return it to its cabinet.&nbsp; In these different contexts, the behaviour of the reasonable person who possesses all of the accused's limitations may be very different, and therefore the answer to the third question regarding the ability of an accused to control or compensate for his or her frailties may be different as well.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A slight change in facts illustrates the requirement that the frailty be one that the accused cannot control, and the need to attend to the context of the offence.&nbsp; While cleaning out a basement would not put the reasonable person on notice, but the label (which meant nothing to Y) would, what if Y were a courier picking up a package from a large laboratory that, to Y's knowledge, manufactures only explosives?&nbsp; The trier of fact could properly expect Y to have recognized his frailty as relevant to the transaction in question and to have asked someone at the lab about transportation safeguards.&nbsp; The reasonable person, even with Y's education, would recognize the risks inherent in such a situation.&nbsp; Thus, the overlap between the responsibility to recognize one's limitations and the focus on the inherent risk and purposefulness of the conduct indicates that Y might well be held to have been at fault in the circumstances, even though he did not in fact recognize a risk.</span></p>

Gosset</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 000, and <i>R. v. Naglik</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 000, issued concurrently, pose related problems, I find it necessary to express my views on the issues that divide my colleagues.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">I start with the fact that, both at the constitutional level and in the interpretation of offences, I favour where practicable the adoption of subjective rather than objective <i>mens rea</i>; see, for example, my concurrence with Wilson J. in <i>R. v. Tutton</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, a case dealing with manslaughter by criminal negligence which my colleagues find it unnecessary to deal with in the present case.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I have been sensitive to the broad divide between true criminal offences and offences that are regulatory or have a regulatory base (see <i>R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154).&nbsp; In consequence I accept that Parliament can and sometimes does require only an objective standard of <i>mens rea</i> for offences intended to regulate a particular form of activity; see <i>R. v. Hundal</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, at p. 876, where I restricted my concurrence with Cory J. on that basis.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">As can be seen from the reasons of McLachlin J. in the present case (at p. 000), the specific requirements of these regulatory and quasi-regulatory offences constitute the major theoretical justification for objective <i>mens rea</i>.&nbsp; I was concerned about the application of the doctrine to offences of a truly criminal character that apply to a wide variety of circumstances.&nbsp; However, any possibility of limiting objective <i>mens rea</i> to regulatory offences or offences having a regulatory base has now been overtaken by the unanimous decision of the panel (comprising a majority of the Court) in <i>R. v. DeSousa</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944.&nbsp; It was there held that in a charge under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec269" target="_blank">s. 269<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, of unlawfully causing bodily harm, it was sufficient to establish that the accused intended to cause the unlawful act (which was interpreted as being a dangerous act) that caused the bodily harm and that a reasonable person would have realized that that unlawful act would subject another person to the risk of bodily harm.&nbsp; In short, the Court held that the underlying offence required personal fault, but that it was sufficient if there was objective foreseeability of consequences.&nbsp; The case further held that the <i>mens rea</i> requirements conformed with the principles of fundamental justice within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In <i>DeSousa</i>, the Court relied on earlier authorities relating to unlawful act manslaughter, the relevant charge in the present case, and for my part I cannot distinguish between the <i>mens rea</i> requirement in the two offences.&nbsp; That an unlawful act may result in death or simply bodily harm is purely fortuitous.&nbsp; McLachlin J.'s reasoning on this point is persuasive.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">On my reading of <i>DeSousa</i>, I would also have thought that it settled the second point of contention between my colleagues, i.e., whether objective <i>mens rea</i> as to consequence should be qualified in the manner proposed by the Chief Justice.&nbsp; The rationale underlying the case would seem to me to favour the position taken by McLachlin J.&nbsp; Since my colleagues have not so read the case, however, I shall attempt to give my reasons for preferring one position over the other.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">While the theoretical differences may be profound, it must be confessed that, in the bulk of cases, there may be less difference in <u>practical</u> result between the adoption of a subjective or an objective approach to <i>mens rea</i> than the proponents of either view would admit.&nbsp; Though <i>Tutton</i> itself was a case where the difference did matter, a careful reading of the competing reasons in that case, I think, demonstrates the truth of what I have just said.&nbsp; To demonstrate, a jury deciding on whether a person adverted to an act or its consequences is bound to be affected by its view of what a reasonable person would do in the circumstances.&nbsp; Similarly, the specific circumstances may well affect a jury's view of what is reasonable.&nbsp; There are important educative and psychological differences between the two approaches that have led me to prefer the subjective view of <i>mens rea</i>.&nbsp; That view underlines that no one will be punished for anything he or she did not intend or at least advert to, and its use supports one's feeling that a morally innocent person will not be punished.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The objective view, however qualified, does not fully serve these ends.&nbsp; It is true that the qualified objective view would theoretically protect some of the individuals the subjective view would protect, but by no means all; see <i>Tutton</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>per</i> Wilson J., at p. 1419.&nbsp; And it does not respond to the educative and psychological ends sought to be attained by those advocating subjective <i>mens rea</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, it introduces a differentiation between individuals in criminal proceedings that, however well meant, seems foreign to our law.&nbsp; What is more, the qualified objective approach loses most of the practical advantages sought to be attained by the objective approach.&nbsp; Indeed, some of the difficulties that have been perceived to result from the adoption of the subjective view would be exacerbated.&nbsp; I think, in particular, of the difficulties of instructing a jury.&nbsp; On this question, too, I find McLachlin J.'s reasons more persuasive.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The second point on which I respectfully diverge is the Chief Justice's conclusion that the standard of care on the objective test in manslaughter and in crimes of negligence varies with the degree of experience, education, and other personal characteristics of the accused.&nbsp; This leads the Chief Justice to hold Mr. Creighton to a higher standard of care than that of the reasonable person in determining if he would have foreseen the risk in question, because of Creighton's long experience as a drug user (p. 000, reasons of Chief Justice).&nbsp; For the reasons set out below I believe the appropriate standard to be that of the reasonable person in all the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; The criminal law is concerned with setting minimum standards of conduct; the standards are not to be altered because the accused possesses more or less experience than the hypothetical average reasonable person.</span></p>

Moreover, the harm must be more than trivial or transitory.&nbsp; The test set out by Sopinka J.

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Chief Justice in his reasons places considerable emphasis on the first factor of stigma. He argues that "there may well be no difference between the <i>actus reus</i> of manslaughter and that of murder; arguably both give rise to the stigma of being labelled by the state and the community as responsible for the wrongful death of another" (p. 000).&nbsp; But later in his reasons (at p. 000) he concedes that&nbsp; "the stigma which attaches to a conviction for unlawful act manslaughter", while "significant... does not approach the opprobrium reserved in our society for those who <u>knowingly</u> or <u>intentionally</u> take the life of another" (emphasis is original).&nbsp; The Chief Justice goes on to observe that "[i]t is for this reason that manslaughter developed as a separate offence from murder at common law."&nbsp; Nevertheless, in the end the Chief Justice concludes that the "constitutional imperative", taken with other factors, requires a minimum <i>mens rea</i> of foreseeability of the risk of death, suggesting that stigma may remain an important factor in his reasoning.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">To the extent that stigma is relied on as requiring foreseeability of the risk of death in the offence of manslaughter, I find it unconvincing.&nbsp; The most important feature of the stigma of manslaughter is the stigma which is <u>not</u> attached to it.&nbsp; The <i>&nbsp;<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> confines manslaughter to non-intentional homicide.&nbsp; A person convicted of manslaughter is <u>not</u> a murderer.&nbsp; He or she did <u>not</u> intend to kill someone.&nbsp; A person has been killed through the fault of another, and that is always serious.&nbsp; But by the very act of calling the killing <u>manslaughter</u> the law indicates that the killing is less blameworthy than murder.&nbsp; It may arise from negligence,&nbsp; or it may arise as the unintended result of a lesser unlawful act.&nbsp; The conduct is blameworthy and must be punished, but its stigma does not approach that of murder.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">To put it another way, the stigma attached to manslaughter is an appropriate stigma.&nbsp; Manslaughter is not like constructive murder, where one could say that a person who did not in fact commit murder might be inappropriately branded with the stigma of murder.&nbsp; The stigma associated with manslaughter is arguably exactly what it should be for an unintentional killing in circumstances where risk of bodily harm was foreseeable.&nbsp; There is much common sense in the following observation: </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">I have suggested that jurisprudential and historic considerations confirm a test for the <i>mens rea</i> of manslaughter based on foreseeability of the risk of bodily injury, rather than death.&nbsp; I have also argued that the considerations of the gravity of the offence and symmetry between the <i>mens rea</i> of the offence and its consequences do not entail the conclusion that the offence of manslaughter as it has been historically defined in terms of foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm is unconstitutional. It is my view that policy considerations support the same conclusion.&nbsp; In looking at whether a long-standing offence violates the principles of fundamental justice it is not amiss, in my view, to look at such considerations.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">First, the need to deter dangerous conduct which may injure others and in fact may kill the peculiarly vulnerable supports the view that death need not be objectively foreseeable, only bodily injury.&nbsp; To tell people that if they embark on dangerous conduct which foreseeably may cause bodily harm which is neither trivial or transient, and which in fact results in death, they will not be held responsible for the death but only for aggravated assault, is less likely to deter such conduct than a message that they will be held responsible for the death, albeit under manslaughter not murder.&nbsp; Given the finality of death and the absolute unacceptability of killing another human being, it is not amiss to preserve the test which promises the greatest measure of deterrence, provided the penal consequences of the offence are not disproportionate.&nbsp; This is achieved by retaining the test of foreseeability of bodily harm in the offence of manslaughter.</span></p>

Knox, 1952), at pp. 26-27) supports the view that an individualized assessment of offensive conduct is simply not possible.&nbsp; If the obligation to refrain from criminal behaviour is perceived as a reflection of the fundamental duty to be rationally cognizant of the equal freedom of all individuals, then the focus of an analysis of <i>culpability</i> must be on the act itself (including its physical and mental elements) and not on the actor.&nbsp; The universality of such obligations precludes the relevance of what Fletcher refers to as "an individualized excusing condition".

The words of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>McErlean v. Sarel</i> (1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 396, a civil case, at p. 413, are equally apposite to the criminal context. The question was whether a teenager riding a bike should be held to the standard of care of a reasonable adult. The Court (Howland C.J.O, Houlden, Morden, Robins and Tarnopolsky JJ.A.) stated:&nbsp; "it would be unfair and, indeed, dangerous to the public to permit [teenagers] in the operation of these power-driven vehicles to observe any lesser standard than that required of all other drivers of such vehicles.&nbsp; The circumstances of contemporary life require a single standard of care with respect to such activities."&nbsp; (See also <i>Dellwo v.

The Queen</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 273, the criminal law makes distinctions in situations where "punishment cannot on any grounds be justified". Such situations mandate an acquittal, according to Wilson J., "because no purpose inherent to criminal liability and punishment -- <i>i.e.</i> the setting right of a wrongful act -- can be accomplished for an act which no rational person would avoid" (p. 273).&nbsp; For these reasons the criminal law does not assign liability where the accused's culpable behaviour is caused by extrinsic factors beyond his or her control.</span></p>

The purpose of Parliament in creating an offence of objective foresight, as in manslaughter, is to stipulate a minimum standard which people engaged in the activity in question are expected to meet.&nbsp; If the standard is lowered by reason of the lack of experience, education, or the presence of some other "personal characteristic" of the accused, the minimum standard which the law imposes on those engaging in the activity in question will be eroded.&nbsp; The objective test inevitably is transformed into a subjective test, violating the wise admonition in <i>R. v.

Problems of perception may have the same effect; regardless of the care taken, the person would have been incapable of assessing the risk, and hence been acquitted.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, in practice, such cases will arise only exceptionally.&nbsp; The question of <i>mens rea</i> will arise only where it has been shown that the accused's conduct (the <i>actus reus</i>) constitutes a dangerous and unlawful act (as in unlawful act manslaughter), or a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person (as in manslaughter by criminal negligence, or penal negligence offences).&nbsp; This established, conflict with the prohibition against punishing the morally innocent will arise only rarely.&nbsp; In unregulated activities, ordinary common sense is usually sufficient to permit anyone who directs his or her mind to the risk of the danger inherent in an activity to appreciate that risk and act accordingly -- be the activity bottle throwing (as in <i>R. v. DeSousa</i>) or a barroom brawl.&nbsp; In many licensed activities, such as driving motor vehicles, there must be a basic amount of knowledge and experience before permission to engage in that activity will be granted (see <i>R. v.

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">This is not to say that the question of guilt is determined in a factual vacuum.&nbsp; While the legal duty of the accused is not particularized by his or her personal characteristics short of incapacity, it is particularized in application by the nature of the activity and the circumstances surrounding the accused's failure to take the requisite care.&nbsp; As McIntyre J. pointed out in <i>R. v. Tutton</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, the answer to the question of whether the accused took reasonable care must be founded on a consideration of all the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; The question is what the reasonably prudent person would have done in all the circumstances.&nbsp; Thus a welder who lights a torch causing an explosion may be excused if he has made an enquiry and been given advice upon which he was reasonably entitled to rely, that there was no explosive gas in the area.&nbsp; The necessity of taking into account all of the circumstances in applying the objective test in offences of penal negligence was affirmed in <i>R. v. Hundal</i>, <i>supra</i>.</span></p>

Newalls Insulation Co. Ltd.</i>, [1953] 1 W.L.R. 8, at p. 17]... <u>But this is a different thing from recognising different legal standards of care</u>; the test of negligence is the same in all cases.&nbsp; So a learner driver must comply with the same objective and impersonal standard as any other driver. [<i>Nettleship v. Weston</i>, [1971] 2 Q.B. 691]&nbsp; So also must a driver who is old or infirm, as distinct from totally unconscious. [<i>Roberts v.

Rogers</i>, [1968] 4 C.C.C. 278 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Sullivan </i>(1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 62 (B.C.S.C.).&nbsp; Such a standard has long been recognized by the common law, which made no distinction on the basis of the actor, only on the basis of the activity:&nbsp; "It is no crime for any one to administer medicine; but it is a crime to administer it so rashly and carelessly as to produce death; and in this respect there is no difference between the most regular practitioner and the greatest quack"&nbsp; (<i>R. v. Crick</i> (1859), 1 F. &amp; F. 519, 175 E.R. 835).&nbsp; The standard flows from the circumstances of the activity.&nbsp; It does not vary with the experience or ability of the actual accused.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A person may fail to meet an elevated <i>de facto</i> standard of care in either of two ways.&nbsp; First, the person may undertake an activity requiring special care when he or she is not qualified to give that care.&nbsp; Absent special excuses like necessity, this may constitute culpable negligence.&nbsp; An untrained person undertaking brain surgery might violate the standard in this way.&nbsp; Second, a person who is qualified may negligently fail to exercise the special care required by the activity.&nbsp; A brain surgeon performing surgery in a grossly negligent way might violate the standard in this second way.&nbsp; The standard is the same, although the means by which it is breached may differ.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Just as the adoption of a uniform standard of care which is blind to personal characteristics of the accused short of incapacity precludes lowering the standard for deficiencies of experience and temperament, so it precludes raising the standard for special experience or training.&nbsp; Since the criminal law is concerned with setting minimum standards for human conduct, it would be inappropriate to hold accused persons to a higher standard of care by reason of the fact that they may be better informed or better qualified than the person of reasonable prudence.&nbsp; Some activities may impose a higher <i>de facto</i> standard than others; brain surgery requires more care than applying an antiseptic.&nbsp; But as discussed earlier, this flows from the circumstances of the activity, not from the expertise of the actor.</span></p>

This requires that the negligence constitute a marked departure from the standards of the reasonable person in all the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; This may consist in carrying out the activity in a dangerous fashion, or in embarking on the activity when in all the circumstances it is dangerous to do so.&nbsp; </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The next question is whether the <i>mens rea</i> is established.&nbsp; As is the case with crimes of subjective <i>mens rea</i>, the <i>mens rea</i> for objective foresight of risking harm is normally inferred from the facts.&nbsp; The standard is that of the reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused.&nbsp; If a person has committed a manifestly dangerous act, it is reasonable, absent indications to the contrary, to infer that he or she failed to direct his or her mind to the risk and the need to take care.&nbsp; However, the normal inference may be negated by evidence raising a reasonable doubt as to lack of capacity to appreciate the risk.&nbsp; Thus, if a <i>prima facie</i> case for <i>actus reus</i> and <i>mens rea</i> is made out,<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup>*<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">*</a></sup></span> it is necessary to ask a further question: did the accused possess the requisite capacity to appreciate the risk flowing from his conduct?&nbsp; If this further question is answered in the affirmative, the necessary moral fault is established and the accused is properly convicted.&nbsp; If not, the accused must be acquitted.</span></p>
