   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff seeking damages in an action for negligent misrepresentation is entitled to be put in the position he or she would have been in if the misrepresentation had not been made.&nbsp; Once the loss occasioned by the transaction is established, the plaintiff has discharged the burden of proof with respect to damages.&nbsp; A defendant who alleges that a plaintiff would have entered into a transaction on different terms sets up a new issue which requires the court to speculate as to what would have happened in a hypothetical situation.&nbsp; It is an area in which it is usually impossible to adduce concrete evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the legal burden generally rests with the plaintiff, it is not immutable.&nbsp; Valid policy reasons will be sufficient to reverse the ordinary incidence of proof.&nbsp; There is good reason for such reversal in this kind of case.&nbsp; The plaintiff is the innocent victim of a misrepresentation which has induced a change of position.&nbsp; A tortfeasor who asks a court to find a transaction whose terms are hypothetical and speculative should bear the burden of displacing the plaintiff's assertion of the <i>status quo ante</i>.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; The court will draw an inference of causation of loss through reliance where the misleading conduct is of such a nature as to be likely to induce a representee to act on it.&nbsp; The inference is capable of being rebutted.&nbsp; The plaintiff may contend that <u>all</u> its losses on the contract were caused by the negligent misrepresentation.&nbsp; But if it is shown that the loss was caused by factors other than the misrepresentation, then the chain of causation is broken.&nbsp; Finally the loss found to be caused by the negligent misstatement must be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the misrepresentation when the misrepresentation was made.</span></p>

(dissenting) -- The plaintiffs (respondents) sued in contract and tort.&nbsp; The torts alleged were negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent misrepresentation.&nbsp; The trial judge based his judgment on negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation and did not consider the contractual claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first appeal, it was held that the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation could not be sustained.&nbsp; No appeal has been taken from this ruling.&nbsp; Therefore, the only action which falls for consideration on this appeal is that of negligent misrepresentation.&nbsp; The issue is what measure of damages flow from the defendant's (appellant's) negligent misrepresentation that the number of meals to be provided by the plaintiff was greater than it in fact was.</span></p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Mardon</i>, [1976] 2 All E.R. 5 (C.A.), Treitel, <i>The Law of Contract</i>, 7th ed. (1987), at pp. 263-64.</span></p>

The plaintiff may also have claim against third parties who cause it loss.</span></p>

This rule comes into play only after it has been established that the defendant's misrepresentation in fact caused the loss.&nbsp; Given that I would remit this case to trial for proper determination of the issue of causation, the rule of remoteness need not be considered at this stage.&nbsp; However, were it necessary to consider it, I would find that losses caused by factors other that the tortious misstatement would not have been foreseeable at the time the representation was made, given that the defendant was entitled to assume that the plaintiffs in bidding would make allowance for all factors relevant to the cost of&nbsp; executing the contract (excluding the defendant's wrongful acts), and that the plaintiff would not exacerbate the loss by its own acts. </span></p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also share the trial judge's view that speculation about what the plaintiffs would have bid had they known the truth is not necessary in a tort action for negligent misrepresentation.&nbsp; The aim in tort is simply to restore the plaintiff to the position it would have been in had the tortious act not been committed.&nbsp; The only question is whether it can be found (or inferred) that the plaintiffs would not have contracted but for the misrepresentation.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contract the matter is otherwise.&nbsp; In contract the aim of damages is to put the plaintiff in the position it would have been in had the representation been true; i.e., to compensate the plaintiff for its contractual expectation.&nbsp; It therefore becomes necessary to determine what would have happened had the representation made as to the number of meals been true.&nbsp; Even this inquiry, however, does not require the court to speculate on what the plaintiff would have bid had it known the true facts (the test proposed by Sopinka J.).</span></p>

Mardon</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>Doyle v. Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd.</i>, [1969] 2 Q.B. 158, general contractual losses were recoverable.&nbsp; However, as Southin J.A. pointed out, there was no allegation in those cases that part of the loss had been caused by the plaintiffs' acts.&nbsp; The defendant is obliged to compensate the plaintiffs for losses caused by the defendant's wrongful act, but not for losses caused by the acts of others.&nbsp; Were it otherwise, the measure of damages in tort might significantly exceed the measure in contract.&nbsp; I agree with Southin J.A. that as a matter of practical justice, the damages awarded for a given wrongful act should be the same, whether the act is seen as a tort or a breach of contract.&nbsp; </span></p>
