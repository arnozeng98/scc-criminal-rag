Subsequently charged with perjury with respect to his testimony at the earlier trial, appellant was acquitted on the basis of issue estoppel. The trial judge found that the issue before him on the perjury trial‑‑the truthfulness of appellant's alibi‑‑had been determined at the impaired driving trial and that the evidence called on the perjury trial was available to the Crown at the earlier trial. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in allowing issue estoppel as a defence to the charge of perjury, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.</span></p>

On a charge of perjury, the Crown is estopped from re‑litigating an issue decided in favour of the appellant‑‑in this case, the truthfulness of appellant's alibi‑‑unless it is tendering, in addition to or in lieu of the evidence previously adduced, evidence that was not available by the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time of the first trial. Here, the new evidence relevant to the falsity of the alibi was available at the time of the original trial but was not called. Although the Crown was taken by surprise by the appellant's alibi it could have introduced the evidence necessary to disprove that alibi on rebuttal.</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson&nbsp;JJ., <i>dissenting</i>: The availability of issue estoppel, although applicable in principle to criminal proceedings where the Crown brings a second charge tangentially concerning the same facts as the charge on which the accused was acquitted, depends on there being explicit findings of fact on which the initial verdict logically depended. These facts must be affirmatively found by the original court and cannot be inferred from an initial verdict reflecting only a reasonable doubt. A judgment fraudulently obtained cannot form the basis of an estoppel. Therefore, if perjury can be established any estoppel which might otherwise exist will necessarily be lost. In such cases, the record of the initial trial must be put in evidence since the falsity of the accused's testimony is central to the charge. The Crown, however, cannot use the perjury charge as a guise to re‑litigate the original charge on evidence it failed to adduce at the original trial, but there is no logical reason to estop a prosecution from introducing fresh evidence which, although available all along, is probative of the essential elements of the perjury charge. In the case at bar, the defence of issue estoppel was not available to the accused because the factual determination underlying the defence would have had to be inferred from the earlier judgment. Indeed, at the first trial, the judge, not only made no finding that the accused was not the person driving the car at the time alleged by the police, but he gave a strong indication that he did not accept the accused's version of the facts. However, because he also had a reasonable doubt as to the Crown's version of the facts, he felt obliged to acquit. </span></p>

The arresting officer testified at his trial on November 1, 1979 that he had stopped Grdic at 6:30 p.m. on the day in question. A breathalizer certificate was introduced showing that Grdic had provided breath samples at 7:30 p.m. and again at 7:50 p.m. that same day and both samples indicated a blood alcohol level of .17. Grdic's defence was mistaken identity. He acknowledged that he was stopped on the day in question but denied that it was at the time alleged. He testified that he was stopped around noon and was home by 5:30 p.m. His daughter corroborated his testimony. His case therefore was that the police must have confused his breathalizer certificates with someone else's.</span></p>

The Crown also called the breathalizer technician as a witness. His testimony was essentially the same as the information contained in his certificate of analysis which was made an exhibit at the trial in November 1979. The trial judge, relying on this Court's judgment in <i>Gushue v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798, acquitted the appellant on the basis of issue estoppel before he was required to elect whether or not to call evidence. He found that the issue before him on the perjury trial had been determined at the impaired driving trial.

McFarlane J.A., writing for the Court, found that the trial judge misapprehended and misapplied <i>Gushue</i> in the same way as <i>Gushue</i> had been misapprehended and misapplied by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench in <i>R. v. Gordon</i>, [1980] 3 W.W.R. 655, and by the Saskatchewan District Court in <i>R. v. Linnen</i> (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 13. The Court of Appeal did not, however, make clear whether it believed that Chief Justice Laskin's decision in <i>Gushue</i> stands for the proposition that issue estoppel is <i>never</i> available on a perjury charge or whether it is available only where the Crown is attempting to re‑try the accused.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In both <i>Gordon</i> and <i>Linnen</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>Gushue</i> was interpreted as holding that the defence of issue estoppel is available to a person accused of perjury whenever the effect of the perjury charge would be to re‑try the accused on issues considered during the first trial in which the impugned testimony was given. As articulated by Kerans J. in <i>Gordon</i> at p.&nbsp;657, issue estoppel would apply any time a common issue can be made out between the initial trial and the subsequent perjury charge. This view is premised on Chief Justice Laskin's statement that the initial "jury finding ... must be regarded as conclusively true" (<i>Gushue</i> at p. 805). This statement, in turn, was construed by the courts in <i>Gordon</i> and <i>Linnen</i> as grounding issue estoppel in a policy that the integrity of jury verdicts must be protected. By contrast, the Court of Appeal in the case at bar suggests that the alternative interpretation of <i>Gushue</i>, namely that issue estoppel is available only where the accused is placed in double jeopardy, is the more plausible one. The problem confronting the Court in the present appeal, therefore, is to determine the scope of issue estoppel as enunciated in <i>Gushue</i> and particularly its applicability to criminal verdicts and subsequent perjury prosecutions. </span></p>

Accordingly, the doctrine is generally treated as part of the law of estoppel. In its broadest sense a plea of <i>res</i> <i>judicata</i> is an allegation that the entire legal rights and obligations flowing between the parties, including questions of both law and fact, have been conclusively disposed of by an earlier judgment: see <i>Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin</i>, [1909] A.C. 615 (P.C.) An estoppel, however, can apply also to a single issue which may arise between two parties who, although litigating for the second time regarding issues related factually to their first case, face each other in an altogether new cause of action: see <i>Hoystead v. Commissioner of Taxation</i>, [1926] A.C. 155 (P.C.)</span></p>

For purposes of this appeal, however, the most significant criterion is that the issue alleged to trigger the estoppel must have clearly confronted the court in the previous proceeding and must have been determined with certainty in the course of that court's findings: see <i>Re Koenigsberg, Public Trustee v. Koenigsberg</i>, [1949] 1 All E.R. 804 (C.A.); <i>Sterling Engineering Co. v. Patchett</i>, [1955] 1 All E.R. 369 (H.L.) As Dickson J. (as he then was) stated in <i>Angle v.

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1964] A.C. 1254 at pp. 1321‑22, it is only in extremely rare circumstances that the relevant issue whose re‑litigation is sought to be estopped can be with sufficient precision identified in the judgment on the earlier proceedings. Indeed, Lord Devlin in <i>Connelly</i> highlighted the central concern in indicating that a criminal verdict typically entails no determination of separate issues by the trier of fact so that its conclusion on any given issue must, in the words of Dickson J. in <i>Angle</i>, <i>supra</i>, be inferred by argument from the judgment. Accordingly Laskin C.J. in <i>Gushue</i> expressed extreme hesitancy in ever permitting an estoppel of a particular question of fact to be premised on a previous criminal verdict in which no specific findings of fact were articulated. Otherwise, he queried, at p.&nbsp;803:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty in identifying with certainty the factual basis upon which a criminal judgment rests has generally led to a much more limited application of issue estoppel in criminal law than in civil litigation. In the absence of specific findings by the previous court, issue estoppel has been held to "only estop[s] the Crown from questioning in later legal proceedings that which was in substance <i>fundamental</i> to the decision in earlier proceedings": <i>R. v. Carlson</i>, [1970] 3 O.R. 213 (Ont. H.C.) at p. 218. (Emphasis added). The restrictive application of the doctrine may be illustrated by the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys</i>, [1977] A.C. 1, a case which entailed facts identical to those in the present appeal. The accused, having first been acquitted of a motor vehicle offence on the strength of his defence of mistaken identity, was charged with having perjured himself during the course of the testimony he gave on his own behalf. Viscount Dilhorne, while expressing doubts as to the very availability of the doctrine in criminal law, noted that even if issue estoppel could operate as a bar to re‑opening a conclusively determined fact, that fact would have to be so crucial to the verdict of the first court as to preclude its relevance to any other charge (p. 22). As Lord Widgery C.J. pointed out in the Court of Appeal, <i>R. v. Humphrys</i>, [1975] 2 All E.R. 1023, at p. 1026:</span></p>

In stating his suspicion that perjury had been committed he gave a strong indication that, although he had a reasonable doubt as to the Crown's version of the events, he was not prepared to accept the facts as presented by the accused. Having regard to that reasonable doubt he had no alternative but to acquit. Accordingly, in the present case the factual determination on which the estoppel is based is one that would have to be inferred from the earlier judgment since it was not the subject of an express finding as required by Dickson J. in <i>Angle</i>, <i>supra</i>. Since it cannot conclusively be inferred from that judgment, I do not believe that issue estoppel constitutes a bar to the Crown's pursuit of the perjury charge. </span></p>

However, since much of the argument was devoted to this issue and since my colleague has dealt with it at some length in his reasons, I am addressing it briefly.</span></p>

(13th ed.) 644. Perjury may be said to be a species of deceitful conduct which, although not itself actionable, partakes of all of the elements of fraud: see <i>Hargreaves v. Bretherton</i>, [1958] 3 All E.R. 122 (Q.B.); <i>Watson v. M'Ewan</i>, [1905] A.C. 480 (H.L.) Accordingly, it is evident that if perjury or other fraudulent conduct can be established any estoppel which might otherwise exist will necessarily be lost.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The offence of perjury requires for its proof an examination of the record of the initial proceedings since regardless of whether the court was actually misled, the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence is the giving of false evidence and the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> of knowingly doing so can be inferred from such an act: see <i>Wolf v. The Queen</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 107. The record of the prior testimony must be compared with some other objective evidence establishing the falsity of such testimony (<i>R. v. Threlfall</i> (1914), 10 Cr. App. R. 112, at p. 114) so that to a certain extent the record of the prior proceedings always constitutes part of the evidence in the subsequent one. Accordingly, although Lord Widgery correctly points out in <i>Humphrys</i>, <i>supra</i>, that there is no exception <i>per se</i> to the doctrine of issue estoppel in relation to a charge of perjury, and the perjury charge cannot be a guise for re‑trying the initial case against the accused, the doctrine does not operate so as to make inadmissible evidence going to the act of making a false statement under oath. Proof of such an act, of course, then amounts to the fraud required in order to undermine the very basis on which the estoppel is founded. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two accepted limitations to the rule that issue estoppel cannot be set up by a party who obtained the initial judgment by fraud, the first being the requirement that any subsequent case against such an accused be made by the Crown on the basis of fresh evidence. This limitation was accepted by Laskin C.J. in <i>Gushue</i> and is eminently sensible in view of the need to prohibit the Crown from re‑litigating an issue determined adversely to it by the initial court. The fresh evidence rule, however, is not an issue in the present case as the Crown did in fact introduce evidence in the perjury case that had not previously formed part of its case against the accused.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second limitation to the rule that fraud undermines issue estoppel, however, is very much in issue if one accepts for the moment that issue estoppel is available to the accused in the present situation. As it is traditionally stated, this limitation reflects the idea that a prior finding of fact can only be undermined through the introduction of new evidence which was not and could not by reasonable diligence have previously been obtained: see <i>Phosphate Sewage Co. v. Molleson</i> (1879), 4 App. Cas. 801 at p. 814 (H.L.) Lord Hailsham articulated the policy grounds underlying this rule in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 40 where he stated that the fact that the accused was in jeopardy of answering the full case had the Crown been diligent in its conduct of the initial trial leads to a demand that it be barred from compensating for its lack of diligence in a second attempt to convict the accused. Accordingly, the rule reflects the fundamental premise of the entire doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> namely, that it is necessary at some point to put an end to any given piece of litigation. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As expressed by Lord Hailsham, the rule that any fresh evidence brought forward by the Crown must have been unavailable at the initial trial is based on the principle that the Crown must be estopped from increasing the prejudice faced by the accused resulting from the Crown's own lack of diligence. This rule, therefore, makes sense when applied to the ordinary plea of <i>res judicata</i> since the non‑diligent prosecution of the accused for the offence charged cannot give way to a subsequent more thorough prosecution for the same offence. It is in this respect that Friedland in his book <i>Double Jeopardy</i> (1969), makes the assertion (p. 129) referred to by my colleague that an acquittal must be perceived as equivalent to a finding of innocence. However, an acquittal for the offence of impaired driving cannot be said to be equivalent to a finding of innocence in a separate charge for perjury any more than it can apply to an altogether factually distinct offence. Where the question is one of issue estoppel rather than <i>res</i> <i>judicata</i>, and the second offence is different from the one with which the accused was initially charged, the prejudice imposed upon the accused is not increased by a lack of diligence on the part of the Crown. Indeed, the only result of the Crown's failure to bring forward all the evidence going to rebut the accused's allegedly perjured testimony in the first instance is the failure of the prosecution to win a conviction on the initial charge. Accordingly, rather than facing the possibility of two convictions, the accused is in jeopardy of conviction for only one offence. The policy ground of increased prejudice upon which Lord Hailsham's insistence on the requirement of previously unavailable evidence is based has no application here. So long as the Crown introduces some evidence that was not introduced on the initial trial there is no basis in principle for excluding fresh evidence probative of the alleged falsity of the accused's testimony.</span></p>

Such facts must be perceived as having been affirmatively found by the original court and cannot be such as must be gathered only inferentially from the initial verdict or as to the finding of which the initial verdict reflects only a reasonable doubt. </span></p>

Accordingly, at a minimum the record of the initial trial must be put in evidence since the falsity of the accused's testimony is the central issue in the perjury charge. Although the Crown may be barred from using the perjury charge as a guise in which to simply re‑litigate the original charge on evidence it failed to adduce on the original charge, there appears to be no logical reason to estop a prosecution from introducing fresh evidence which, although available all along, is probative of the essential elements of the perjury charge. Such evidence, despite its having been available, may have been perceived as of only minimal relevance to the initial charge and its subsequent introduction in the case to which it is highly relevant cannot be said to prejudice the accused in any way.</span></p>

Ct. J. when he dismissed the original charges; that the Crown was not allowed, in effect, to re‑try an accused through the mechanism of a trial on perjury charges, except if there was fresh evidence which was not available at the time of the original trial. Finding that the evidence to rebut Grdic's alibi was available to the Crown at the time of the original trial and that it did not seek to apply for an adjournment to call rebuttal evidence, he applied the principle of issue estoppel and, as a result, acquitted the accused.</span></p>

In my view, unless it can be said that the subsequent prosecution is an attempt by the Crown to re‑try the accused‑‑and that is not the case here‑‑the preferable policy is to exclude issue estoppel, especially when the contradictory statements on which the charge under s. 124 is founded consist of admissions of the accused himself.</span></p>

But it does mean that any issue, the resolution of which had to be in favour of the accused as a prerequisite to the acquittal, is irrevocably deemed to have been found conclusively in favour of the accused (see <i>R. v. Carlson</i>, [1970] 3 O.R. 213; <i>contra</i>, <i>Villemaire v. The Queen</i> (1962), 39 C.R. 297 at p. 300). This is so even though the judgment might well be the result of a reasonable doubt on that issue, and even when the judge has said so or expressed views that indicate clearly that his finding, though inuring to the benefit of the accused, had been arrived at with reluctance and the judge has suggested that it is not conclusively in favour of the accused. </span></p>

This can only be done through the appeal process finding reversible error resulting in the ordering of a new trial before a different judge. Therefore perjury <i>may</i> defeat issue estoppel but, as said De Grey C.J., only "from without", that is, only if there is additional evidence (I use here the expression "additional evidence" as including any evidence that was not put before the trier of fact in the previous proceeding, whether available or not at the time); it may defeat the estoppel, but not necessarily, and this leads into the second limitation.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">In an indictment for perjury like the present I would think that it is the duty of the court to apply the double jeopardy rule against the Crown not as a matter of discretion but as a matter of law where it is satisfied in substance that all the prosecution is doing is trying to get behind the original verdict by re‑trying the same evidence. But where the prosecution by calling additional evidence which it could not have had available using reasonable diligence at the time of the first trial is in substance as well as in form putting the accused in jeopardy not for the original alleged misdemeanour of which he has been acquitted (or convicted) but for his crime against justice committed by perjuring himself at the first trial, there is no double jeopardy and the prosecution is entitled to adduce the evidence and make the assertions necessary to achieve its purpose whether or not the effect is to give rise to the inference that the previous verdict of acquittal was insupportable, or the previous conviction and punishment right. </span></p>

And I am inclined to think the same rule should be applied: "available" means "available by the exercise of reasonable diligence". (Perhaps it should involve also a question of materiality. Fresh evidence operates as a justifying factor. If there is fresh evidence, then a case may be tried and the fresh evidence as well as all other relevant evidence may be advanced, including some that may have been available but not called at the first hearing. The fresh evidence is the Crown's ticket for a new trial. It should therefore be of some significance.)</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is conceded by the Crown that the new evidence was available at the time of the original trial. It is argued that "it was not called because it could not have been anticipated that it was necessary". I agree that it could not have been anticipated during the Crown's case prior to the defence; indeed Grdic did not give any indication, either prior to trial or through his cross‑examination of witnesses that his defence would be one of mistaken identity through proof of his being present elsewhere at the time of the taking of the sample. That the Crown was taken by surprise by this defence is beyond doubt, as is beyond doubt the fact that the Crown could not, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, foresee the defence. The Crown was therefore entitled to call rebuttal evidence which, under the law, had it chosen to do so, should have been allowed. Indeed, a trial judge should exercise his discretion in favour of allowing rebuttal evidence when the issue raised by the defence arose <i>ex improviso</i>, could not have been foreseen by the Crown, and that the Crown is not in effect attempting to split its case. (See for example <i>R. v. Parkin (No. 2)</i> (1922), 37 C.C.C. 35; <i>R. v. Therien and Sanseverino</i> (1943), 80 C.C.C. 87; <i>R. v. Coombs</i> (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 85; <i>R. v. Campbell</i> (1978), 1 C.R. (3d) 309 and <i>R. v. Kerr</i> (1983), 18 Man. R. (2d) 230). Admissible through rebuttal, the evidence was available to the Crown and the Crown, having heard the defence, was no longer in a position to argue that "it could not have been anticipated that it was necessary" to call that evidence.</span></p>
