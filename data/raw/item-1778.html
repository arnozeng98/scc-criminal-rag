 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">Judicial experience with the effects of mental disorder on criminal responsibility, with the type of evidence that is available to demonstrate it, and with the unjustified skepticism that may be directed at an accused relying on the defence of mental disorder, should have given the Court of Appeal cause for concern that the verdict reached by the jury in the present case was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.&nbsp; Careful and thorough scrutiny of the record confirms that concern was warranted.&nbsp; Apart from the psychiatric evidence, the statements made by the accused to the police, and, prior to that, to the father of his friend, whom he informed of the killing and whom he asked to inform the police, are not inconsistent with the conclusions reached by the experts, nor is the accused‚Äôs conduct surrounding the commission of the offence.&nbsp; It is not necessarily easy for a jury to accept that, in lay person‚Äôs terms, an accused who knows what he is doing and knows that it is a crime could still genuinely believe that he would not be morally condemned by reasonable members of society for his conduct.&nbsp; The defence proved this to be the case and, on the evidence tendered at this trial, it was unreasonable to conclude otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

The proper test is ‚Äúwhether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered‚Äù (<i>Yebes</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 185).&nbsp; In embarking on the exercise mandated by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec686subsec1" target="_blank">s. 686(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>)(i) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, the reviewing court must engage in a thorough re-examination of the evidence and bring to bear the weight of its judicial experience to decide whether, on all the evidence, the verdict was a reasonable one.&nbsp; Inevitably the verdict will be one that was open to the jury, in the sense that it was not an error of law for the trial judge to leave it to the jury for consideration.&nbsp; Moreover, it is not sufficient for the reviewing judge to simply take a different view of the evidence than the jury did.&nbsp; The appeal court, if it is to overturn the verdict, must articulate the basis upon which it concludes that the verdict is inconsistent with the requirements of a judicial appreciation of the evidence.&nbsp; This is what must now be done in this case.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

But if one can see beyond the torrent of obscenities, the statement reveals a deeply disturbed person.&nbsp; At the outset, he was belligerent - interrupting the police officer with obscenities while the officer was attempting to extend to him <i>Charter</i> rights.&nbsp; But when told of his right to counsel, he dissolves into tears and asks that his sister be contacted.&nbsp; The police assure him that they are endeavoring to do so.</p>

Texas</i>, 441 U.S. 418 (1979), in rejecting the ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù standard as inappropriate in civil commitment proceedings, the United States Supreme Court said (at p. 430):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

Shane and Yaren differed in their precise diagnoses, both agreed that they were quite consistent.&nbsp; The diagnosed mental illnesses shared key symptoms, including visual and auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions which together severely impair the sufferer‚Äôs contact with or grasp of reality.&nbsp; Further, both doctors were of the opinion that the appellant‚Äôs act of shooting his grandfather was consistent with his mental disorder having caused him to believe that only in so doing could he save himself from further torment.&nbsp;</p>
