No. 3071 (QL), 2005 BCSC 751, at para. 37).&nbsp; In light of this conclusion, the trial judge found it unnecessary to consider the limited evidence regarding Mr.&nbsp;Beatty’s explanation for the accident.&nbsp; The trial judge added, however, that if she had concluded that Mr.&nbsp;Beatty’s manner of driving was objectively dangerous, she would have found this evidence insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Beatty was acquitted on all three counts.</p>

Unquestionably, conduct which constitutes a departure from the norm expected of a reasonably prudent person forms the basis of both civil and penal negligence.&nbsp; However, it is important not to conflate the civil standard of negligence with the test for penal negligence.&nbsp; Unlike civil negligence, which is concerned with the apportionment of loss, penal negligence is aimed at punishing <i>blameworthy</i> conduct.&nbsp; Fundamental principles of criminal justice require that the law on penal negligence concern itself not only with conduct that deviates from the norm, which establishes the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence, but with the offender’s mental state.&nbsp; The&nbsp; onus lies on the Crown to prove both the <i>actus reus </i>and the <i>mens rea</i>.&nbsp; Moreover, where liability for penal negligence includes potential imprisonment, as is the case under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec249" target="_blank">s. 249<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, the distinction between civil and penal negligence acquires a constitutional dimension.</p>

As contemplated by <i>Hundal</i> Mr. Beatty’s negligent driving undoubtedly falls within the continuum of negligence that is certain to attract considerable civil liability.&nbsp; It is in that forum that redress for his actions will be found. &nbsp;[Emphasis in original; para. 37.]</p>

The court’s reasoning is aptly captured in paras. 22-27 of the reasons for judgment where Finch C.J.B.C., writing for the court, stated as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">In this case, there is no evidence that the respondent was speeding, no evidence that he had consumed alcohol or drugs, and no evidence that he was driving erratically or improperly at any time before his vehicle crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">However, the evidence showed that there was only one lane for travel in each direction, the traffic was proceeding at or near the posted speed limit of 90 kilometres per hour, the highway was well-travelled, there was limited visibility approaching the curve, and the collision occurred within a split second of the respondent’s crossing onto the oncoming lane of traffic.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">Viewed objectively, the respondent’s failure to confine his vehicle to its own lane of travel was in “all the circumstances” highly dangerous to other persons lawfully using the highway, and in particular those approaching in a westerly direction on their own side of the road.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">The trial judge addressed her attention to the respondent’s “momentary lack of attention” and his “few seconds of lapsed attention”.&nbsp; She held that such a momentary lapse should not be characterized as dangerous driving.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">In my respectful opinion the learned trial judge asked the wrong question. The right question was whether crossing the centre line into the path of oncoming traffic at 90 kilometres per hour, on a well-travelled highway was objectively dangerous.&nbsp; I think that question could only be answered in the affirmative.&nbsp; Driving in that way is clearly a “marked departure” from the standard of care a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s situation.</p>

Parliament can, of course, by express words, create criminal offences for which a guilty intention is not an essential ingredient.&nbsp; Equally, <i>mens rea</i> is not requisite in a wide category of statutory offences which are concerned with public welfare, health and safety.&nbsp; Subject to these exceptions, <i>mens rea</i>, consisting of some positive states of mind, such as evil intention, or knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, or reckless disregard of consequences, must be proved by the prosecution.&nbsp; The mental element may be established by inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">It is a basic tenet of the principles of fundamental justice that the state not be permitted to punish and deprive of liberty the morally innocent.&nbsp; Those who have the capacity to live up to a standard of care and fail to do so, in circumstances involving inherently dangerous activities, however, cannot be said to have done nothing wrong.&nbsp; The Law Reform Commission of Canada emphasized this point in the following passage from <i>Workplace Pollution</i>, Working Paper 53 (1986), at pp. 72‑73:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

(as she then was) aptly put it in <i>R. v. Creighton</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at p. 59:&nbsp; “The law does not lightly brand a person as a criminal.”&nbsp; In addition to the largely automatic and reflexive nature of driving, we must also consider the fact that driving, although inherently risky, is a legal activity that has social value.&nbsp; If every departure from the civil norm is to be criminalized, regardless of the degree, we risk casting the net too widely and branding as criminals persons who are in reality not morally blameworthy.&nbsp; Such an approach risks violating the principle of fundamental justice that the morally innocent not be deprived of liberty.</p>

Cory J., in <i>Hundal</i>, gave some useful examples (at p. 887):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">I agree with the Chief Justice (at para. 75) that the analysis in <i>Willock</i> does not have the effect of imposing on the Crown the burden of proving the subjective intention of the accused in order to make out the offence.&nbsp; Doherty J.A. specifically held at para. 31 that “conduct occurring in a two to three second interval can amount to a marked departure from the standard of a reasonable person and demonstrate a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of others”.&nbsp; Doherty J.A. simply recognizes, as I do, that evidence about the actual intention of an accused is relevant to a court’s objective assessment of whether or not conduct constitutes a marked departure from the norm.</p>

The Court of Appeal overturned the conviction on the grounds that in the circumstances, where the accused’s driving had otherwise been wholly proper, the Crown had the burden of proving that the accused deliberately caused his vehicle to swerve.</p>

It was not necessary that the accused subjectively appreciated the risks associated with his conduct or that he appreciated that his conduct represented a marked departure from the reasonable person standard.&nbsp; Doherty J.A. simply held that in the circumstances, evidence of the appellant’s intentions was necessary for assessing his conduct on the objective standard, because on the facts in that case, if the accused had not intentionally caused the car to swerve, the remaining evidence was not sufficient to show a marked departure.</p>
