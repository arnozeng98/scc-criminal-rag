 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliament worded s. 121(1)(<i>c</i>) broadly and did not intend to restrict its application solely to situations where the gift was motivated by the recipient’s position in government.&nbsp; The section’s potentially wide application can be limited through statutory interpretation without introducing an additional element.&nbsp; The first component of the section is that a commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind be given by a person having “dealings with the government”.&nbsp; The proper interpretation of the term “dealings” is the narrow one, whereby only where persons are in the process of having commercial dealings with the government at the time of the offence is the conduct trapped under the section.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second element of the <i>actus reus</i> is the receipt of that “commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind” by a government employee.&nbsp; The phrase “of any kind” was not meant to widen the scope of the provision’s reach.&nbsp; It was not worded or intended to mean “of whatever amount” or “of any value”, but rather was intended to trap diverse forms of&nbsp; benefits other than those of a strictly monetary nature.&nbsp; Many of the absurd consequences of adopting an unlimited wide meaning of the term “advantage or benefit” can be avoided by a stricter reading of the term, and a recognition that it requires the beneficiary to have secured a material or tangible gain before falling into the confines of the section.&nbsp; It is important to consider the relationship between the parties as well as the scope of the benefit.&nbsp; The closer the relationship, the less likely the gift should be perceived as an advantage or benefit to the recipient.&nbsp; Whether a gift can be seen as a true “benefit” to someone is a question of fact for the jury to determine based on all the evidence in the case.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to <i>mens rea</i>, since this offence constitutes a “conduct” crime, it requires that to be culpable the accused know of the conduct he or she committed, and have knowledge of the circumstances in which it occurred.&nbsp; In order to prove the offence in s.&nbsp;121(1)(<i>c</i>), it is thus necessary for the Crown to prove the following fault elements:&nbsp; (a) an employee's conscious decision to accept what in all of the circumstances is found to be a "commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind"; and (b) knowledge (or wilful blindness) at the time of the receipt that the giver was having dealings with the government and that the employee's superior had not consented to his or her receipt of the "commission, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind".&nbsp; Since this level of <i>mens rea</i> is&nbsp; recognized as a valid form of criminal culpability, there is no need to add any additional components.&nbsp; The motivation behind a particular benefit is not a completely irrelevant consideration, however, as it is an important factor in determining the appropriate level of culpability.&nbsp; Clearly, where a government employee actually possessed a corrupt intention in accepting a benefit he or she will usually merit a higher sentence than a person lacking such a motive.</span></p>

Sault Ste. Marie (City</i>), supra, at p. 1324 (S.C.R.), pp. 373‑374 (C.C.C.), (pp. 52-54 C.R.); A. W. Mewett and M.&nbsp;Manning, <i>Criminal Law</i> -- 2d. ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1985), pp.&nbsp;116‑120; Law Reform Commission of Canada, <i>Criminal Law -- The General Part</i> (Working Paper 29) (1982), pp. 24‑26.&nbsp; Knowledge combined with a volitional act may be seen as a minimum level of culpability. However, for many crimes which do not require proof that any consequence flowed or was intended to flow from the doing of the prohibited act in the relevant circumstances, a volitional act combined with knowledge of the relevant circumstances generally constitutes the only culpability requirement. Indeed, in its recent work, <i>Recodifying the Criminal Law</i> (Working Paper No. 31) (1987), at pp. 21‑23, the Law Reform Commission of Canada, in its proposed General Part for a new <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, recommends, where the definition of a crime does not require proof of a particular consequence, that the culpability or fault requirement consist of a volitional act done with knowledge of, or recklessness as to, the existence of the circumstances set out in the statutory definition. The Crown's submission is firmly rooted in contemporary notions of criminal culpability.</span></span></p>

The criminal law is essentially a means whereby society seeks to prevent, and, failing that, punish blameworthy conduct which strikes at the fundamental values of the community. The criminal law is, however, a weapon of last resort intended for use only in cases where the conduct is so inconsistent with the shared morality of society so as to warrant public condemnation and punishment: see <i>The Criminal Law in Canadian Society</i> (Government of Canada, 1982), <i>Libman v.

There must be at least a rough equivalence between what judges say is criminal and what the community regards as morally blameworthy. <u>Judicial interpretation of statutory language so as to declare conduct criminal which members of the community view as innocent or morally neutral does a disservice to the overall operation of the criminal law</u>: see Law Reform Commission of Canada, <i>Our Criminal Law</i> (1976); Sayre, “Public Welfare Offences” (1933), 33 Col.

The offences created by those sections, however, limit the scope of those words by requiring that the advantage or benefit be given or received for a specific purpose, (s.&nbsp;121(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>)) or in relation to the giver's dealings with the government (s. 121(1)(<i>b</i>)): see <i>R. v. Giguere</i>, supra, at p. 458 (S.C.R.), p. 9 (C.C.C.). Those sections differentiate between criminal benefits and other benefits by reference to the giver's or recipient's state of mind. No such limitation is found in s. 121(1)(<i>c</i>). However, that section creates a crime which is as serious and serves the same purpose as the other offences created by s.&nbsp;121. It is therefore necessary to choose, from the available definitions, meanings for the words "advantage or benefit" which limit s. 121(1)(<i>c</i>) to its intended purpose.</span></span></p>

The question is settled by an objective assessment of all of the relevant evidence and not exclusively by reference to the recipient's subjective state of mind.

(<i>Taylor</i>, <i>supra</i>, per Laycraft C.J.A., at p. 269). The part of the body touched, the nature of the contact, the situation in which it occurred, the words and gestures accompanying the act, and all other circumstances surrounding the conduct, including threats which may or may not be accompanied by&nbsp; force, will be relevant (see S.J. Usprich, "A New Crime in Old Battles: Definitional Problems with Sexual Assault" (1987), 29 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 200, at p. 204). <i>The intent or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in&nbsp; considering whether the conduct is sexual</i>. If the motive of&nbsp; the accused is sexual gratification, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence it may be a factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual. It must be emphasized, however, that the existence of such a motive is&nbsp; simply one of many factors to be considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the circumstances.” [Emphasis added by Doherty J.A.]</span></span></p>
