24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Lamer&nbsp;C.J. and Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, Iacobucci and Major&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; The orthodox rule that prior inconsistent statements are not admissible for the truth of their contents is a particular instance of the rule against admitting hearsay.&nbsp; In recent years, however, this Court's decisions have established that the traditional inflexible approach to the hearsay rule and its exceptions is to be rejected in favour of an approach which allows evidence to be admitted and used substantively when it is shown to be reliable and necessary.&nbsp; Both necessity and reliability must be interpreted flexibly, taking account of the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; When the reliability and necessity criteria are met, prior inconsistent statements of witnesses other than the accused are substantively admissible, provided that they would have been admissible as the witness's sole testimony.&nbsp; The gravest danger associated with hearsay evidence, namely the absence of contemporaneous cross‚Äëexamination, simply does not exist in the case of prior inconsistent statements because the witness is available for cross‚Äëexamination.&nbsp; The other two dangers, absence of an oath and absence of demeanour evidence, can be met through appropriate police procedures and occasionally appropriate substitutes can be found.&nbsp; Finally, the prior statement is necessary evidence when a witness recants.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A threshold of reliability can sometimes be established, in cases where the witness is available for cross‚Äëexamination, by a striking similarity between two statements.&nbsp; In order to eliminate, or at least substantially reduce, the likelihood of a similarity between two statements arising through coincidence, the similar factual assertion must be so striking that it is highly unlikely two people would have independently fabricated it.&nbsp; In some cases, the necessary degree of similarity will result from the unique nature of particular factual assertions in both statements.&nbsp; In other situations it may be that the cumulative combination of similar points renders the overall similarity between the two statements sufficiently distinctive to reject coincidence as a likely explanation.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">After the calling party invokes <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec9" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;9<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, and fulfils its requirements in the <i>voir dire</i> held under that section, the party must then state its objectives in tendering the statement.&nbsp; If the statement will only be used to impeach the witness, the inquiry ends at this point.&nbsp; If, however, the calling party wishes to make substantive use of the statement, the <i>voir dire</i> must continue so that the trial judge can assess whether a threshold of reliability has been met.&nbsp; The necessity criterion need not be assessed as it is met whenever a witness recants.&nbsp; If the reliability criterion is to be met, in rare cases, by the striking similarity between the statement being assessed and another statement which is already clearly substantively admissible, the trial judge must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there are striking similarities between the two statements, and that there was neither reason nor opportunity for the declarants to collude, nor improper influence by interrogators or other third parties.&nbsp; The trial judge must also ascertain that the prior statement relates evidence which would be admissible as the witness's sole testimony.&nbsp; If the trial judge determines that the statement meets the threshold reliability criterion and is thus substantively admissible, he or she must direct the trier of fact to follow a two‚Äëstep process in evaluating the evidence.&nbsp; The trier of fact must first be certain that the statement which is being used as a reliability referent was made, without taking into account the prior inconsistent statement under consideration.&nbsp; Once the trier of fact is satisfied that the other statement was made, the trier of fact may compare the similarities between the two statements and, if they are sufficiently striking that it is unlikely that two people would have independently fabricated them, the trier of fact may draw conclusions from that comparison about the truth of the statements.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In this case, the recanting witness was cross‚Äëexamined in detail about her reasons for changing her story at a preliminary inquiry, on a <i>voir dire</i> under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec9" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;9<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, and before the jury.&nbsp; She provided a comprehensive explanation for changing her story which could be assessed by both the trial judge and the jury and therefore eliminates the most important danger of hearsay evidence.&nbsp; The statements made by the accused and by his daughter contained both a significant number of similarities in detail and the strikingly similar assertion that the most recent sexual contact between the two had been the previous evening.&nbsp; As a <i>voir dire</i> was also held with regard to the accused's statement, there was sufficient evidence presented to found a conclusion that the accused and his daughter had neither a reason nor an opportunity to collude, and that the accused was not improperly influenced by the police officers who took his statement.&nbsp; The complainant's statement was therefore substantively admissible at trial.&nbsp; The absence of correct jury instructions does not alter the outcome of this appeal as the statements are so strikingly similar that the jury would inevitably have been satisfied as to their reliability.&nbsp; The objection that the jury instructions left open the possibility that the daughter's statement would be used for the truth of its contents does not arise given the conclusion that the statement was substantively admissible.</span></p>

R.</i>, [1967] 1 All E.R. 80 (P.C.), as an example of a case where the similarity of out-of-court statements was used to draw non-hearsay inferences about something other than credibility.&nbsp; He distinguished the case of <i>McFall v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 321, by noting that in that case the jury had been invited to use the statements of co-accused for their truth, not for the fact that they were made.&nbsp; Continuing, Osborne J.A. declared (at pp. 558-59):</span></p>

Put another way, the fact that the complainant said what she did in her statement adds value to the appellant's confession to the police.&nbsp; The comparison which the jury was invited to make would test the coincidence which is evident from a consideration of the substance of both statements.&nbsp; This analysis does not depend on the truth of the complainant's statement but rather on the fact that she made it.</span></p>
