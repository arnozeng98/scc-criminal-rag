   <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law —Breathalizer test —Statutes —Interpretation —Number of breath samples to be taken —Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.&nbsp;C-34, ss. 235, 237(1)(f) as amended by the Criminal Code Amendment Act 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c.&nbsp;93—Interpretation Act, R.S.C.&nbsp;1970, c.&nbsp;I-23, s.&nbsp;26(7).</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Respondent was acquitted at trial on a charge of driving a motor vehicle contrary to s.&nbsp;236 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> (<i>i.e. </i>while having a blood alcohol level in excess of .08). The only evidence of the blood alcohol level of the respondent introduced at his trial was a certificate of a qualified technician pursuant to s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) of the <i>Code </i>showing the result of one analysis of a breath sample. The Crown appealed by way of stated case on the basis that the trial judge had erred in law by holding, first, that the certificate tendered pursuant to s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) was inadmissible as only one sample of breath was taken and, second, that s.&nbsp;26(7) of the <i>Interpretation Act </i>had no application to the interpretation of ss. 235 and 237 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The Appeal Division dismissed the appeal and held that at least two breath samples had to be taken under s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>) of the <i>Code </i>before certificate can be admitted into evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">:<i> </i>The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">While prior to the amending legislation [<i>Criminal Code Amendment Act 1975, </i>1974‑75‑76 (Can.), c.&nbsp;93] a certificate based on the analysis of only one sample of breath constituted of itself evidence of the blood alcohol level of a person charged under s.&nbsp;236 and was sufficient to create a rebuttable presumption, consideration of the wording of the sections&nbsp;before and after the amendment makes it clear that the rebuttable presumption now arises only where <i>samples </i>of the breath of the accused have been taken. That requirement is not satisfied by showing that only one sample has been taken. Section 26(7) of the <i>Interpretation Act </i>has no application as it is not necessary to give the apparent legislative intent to s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) which taken in context clearly applies only</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 633]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">where more than one breath sample has been taken. Further s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>)(ii), in providing for an “interval of at least fifteen minutes between the time when the samples were taken”, clearly establishes that more than one sample is required.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of the Court was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal, brought with leave of this Court, from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick dismissing an appeal by way of stated case from the acquittal of the respondent at his trial before Provincial Court Judge Harper, on a charge of driving a motor vehicle contrary to s.&nbsp;236 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>which provides, in part, that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Every one who drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres… of blood is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable by summary conviction…</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The case stated by the learned trial judge at the instance of the Attorney General, pursuant to s.&nbsp;762 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>is set out in full in the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr.&nbsp;Justice Limerick in the Appeal Division and it reveals that</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">A certificate of a qualified technician pursuant to Section 237(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Criminal Code of Canada showing the result of one analysis of a breath sample….</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 634]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">was the only evidence of the blood alcohol level of the respondent introduced at his trial in proof of the offence charged.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The following grounds of appeal are stipulated in the “stated case”:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law by holding that a Certificate of a Qualified Technician tendered in evidence pursuant to section&nbsp;237(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Criminal Code of Canada is inadmissible if only one sample of breath is taken.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">2. The learned Trial Judge erred in law by holding that section&nbsp;26(7) of the <i>Interpretation Act </i>of Canada R.S.C. 1970 has no application to the interpretation of Section 235 and Section 237 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA">.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the combined effect of ss. 235 and 237 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>as amended by the <i>Criminal Code Amendment Act 1975, </i>1974-75-76 (Can.), c.&nbsp;93, is that the certificate of a qualified technician based on the analysis of only one sample of breath, constitutes <i>of itself </i>evidence of the blood alcohol content of a person charged under s.&nbsp;236 at the time of the alleged offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I have no doubt that, before the amendment above referred to, such a certificate was sufficient to create a rebuttable presumption as to the blood alcohol content of the blood of such a person but the question here at issue is whether the amendment has had the effect of requiring the certificate to be based on the analysis of two or more such samples before it can be acceptable as evidence of its contents without further proof.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It appears to me that this question can best be answered by a consideration of the wording of the relevant parts of these sections&nbsp;before and after the amendment and these are reproduced hereunder side by side for the purpose of comparison:</span></p>

   <p class="Para" align="right" style="text-align:right"><span lang="EN-CA">[The italics throughout are my own]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Sections (<i>d</i>)<i> </i>and (<i>e</i>) of s.&nbsp;237(1) remain as they were before the amendment.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The central contention advanced on behalf of the appellant is that under the wording of s.&nbsp;235 as amended, the number of samples of his breath which a suspected person may be required to provide is dependant entirely upon the opinion of the qualified technician as to what is <i>necessary </i>to enable a proper analysis to be made and that</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 638]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">accordingly as there is nothing to preclude the acceptance by the technician of only one sample for analysis, it must follow that one sample so analyzed is acceptable at trial as evidence of the blood alcohol content of a person charged under s.&nbsp;236. This argument is said to be strengthened by the further contention that the words “such samples of his breath” as they occur in the amended s.&nbsp;235(1) are to be construed as meaning “such sample or samples” in accordance with s.&nbsp;26(7) of the <i>Interpretation Act, </i>1967-68 (Can.), c.&nbsp;7 which provides that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The questions raised by this stated case are, however, in no way dependant on whether or not the technician was satisfied that only one sample was necessary for his analysis; what is at issue here is whether or not a technician’s certificate based on the analysis of only one sample is, of itself, without further proof, <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the statements contained in it and this must depend on whether the rebuttable presumption accorded to such a certificate by s.&nbsp;237, before the amendment, subsists under the section&nbsp;as amended or whether the new wording requires that the certificate be based upon two or more analyses before it can be accepted without further proof of its contents.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The effect of s.&nbsp;237 both before and after the amendment is to establish the conditions under which the certificate of a qualified technician is admissable, without further evidence, as proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused. These provisions are obviously designed to assist the Crown in proving its case, and as they serve to restrict the normal rights of the accused to cross-examination and saddle him with the burden of proving that the certificate does not accurately reflect his blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offence, they are to be strictly construed and, where ambiguous, interpreted in favour of the accused.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I subscribe to the opinion expressed by Chief Justice Hughes in the last two paragraphs of his reasons for judgment in the Appeal Division where he said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 639]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">In my opinion the new s.&nbsp;237(1) makes it amply clear that the rebuttable presumption as to the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time of the alleged offence arises only ‘where <i>samples </i>of the breath of the accused have been taken…’ and this requirement is not satisfied by showing that only one sample has been taken.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Both clauses (<i>c</i>)<i> </i>and (<i>f</i>)<i> </i>of s.&nbsp;237(1) confer special advantages on the prosecution and impose a particular burden upon an accused to meet the burden of proof which arises when the certificate of a qualified technician is received in evidence. Such a provision must, in my opinion, be strictly construed and the requirement that a certificate of a qualified technician is admissible only ‘where <i>samples </i>of the breath of the accused have been taken’ cannot be extended by the provisions of the Interpretation Act declaring the singular to include the plural and vice versa to a case where only one sample of the breath of the accused has been taken. Such a provision, in my opinion, should only be resorted to where it is necessary to give effect to the apparent legislative intent of the Act being considered. No such necessity arises in construing clause (<i>f</i>) of s.&nbsp;237(1) which in the context of the amendments referred to above clearly applies only where more than one sample of the breath of the accused has been taken.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am of opinion also that s.&nbsp;237(1)(<i>c</i>)(ii) in providing for “an interval of at least fifteen minutes between the time when the samples were taken”, clearly establishes that more than one sample is required.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">For all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.</span></p>
