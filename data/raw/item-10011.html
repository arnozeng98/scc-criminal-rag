 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown alleged that P and his co‑accused, S, participated in a fraudulent scheme involving the fictitious sale of heavy equipment to generate harmonized sales tax that was then not remitted to the federal government as required. &nbsp;The fraudulent nature of the scheme was never challenged. &nbsp;The involvement of P and S in the scheme was also conceded. &nbsp;The question for the jury was whether either or both accused were aware of the fraudulent nature of the scheme. &nbsp;P did not testify, but was incriminated by S’s testimony. In his closing address, S’s counsel invited the jury to infer P’s guilt from P’s failure to testify. &nbsp;The trial judge refrained from giving a remedial instruction to the jury about P’s right to silence. &nbsp;P was convicted and sentenced and his appeal was dismissed.</p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In assessing the credibility and reliability of evidence upon which the Crown can and does rely, a jury is entitled to take into account, among other things, the fact that the evidence stands uncontradicted, if that is the case, and the jury may be so instructed. &nbsp;The fact that evidence is uncontradicted does not mean that the jury must accept it and an instruction to that effect should also be given.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, S’s counsel could have relied on the fact that his client had testified to argue that S was innocent and had “nothing to hide”.&nbsp; Moreover, he could have emphasized that S’s testimony stood uncontradicted and that the jury could consider this in assessing whether they believed his evidence or whether it left them in a state of reasonable doubt. &nbsp;What S’s counsel could not do is mislead the jury on a matter of law. &nbsp;He could not invite the jury to use P’s silence at trial as evidence, much less evidence of guilt.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While counsel’s comment should not have been made, the judge would not have allowed the trial to proceed if he truly believed that the comment had irretrievably compromised P’s fair trial rights. &nbsp;He only allowed it to proceed — with the acquiescence of P’s counsel who did not move for severance — on the belief that he could disabuse the jury of the notion that P’s silence at trial could be used as evidence of his guilt. &nbsp;Although an explicit remedial instruction from the trial judge would have been preferable, his jury charge, when considered as a whole, was adequate. &nbsp;The jury would have understood that the Crown could prove P’s guilt only on the evidence and, as P’s silence at trial did not constitute evidence, it could not be used to prove his guilt.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the hearsay evidence, the trial judge’s error in admitting it was harmless and there is no realistic possibility that the verdict would have been different had the error not been made. &nbsp;The trial judge had warned the jury that this evidence should be approached with caution and other items of confirmatory evidence were available to the jury. &nbsp;Accordingly, this is a case where the curative proviso of s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> can safely be applied to uphold P’s conviction.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</i> McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. and LeBel, Fish and Cromwell&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting): &nbsp;The trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that no adverse inference could be drawn from P’s silence. &nbsp;Whenever there is a significant risk ― as the trial judge found in this case ― that the jury will otherwise treat the accused’s silence as evidence of guilt, an appropriate remedial direction ought to be given to the jury. &nbsp;That was not done here.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard instructions on the definition of evidence, the presumption of innocence, the Crown’s burden of proof and the reasonable doubt standard will not suffice. &nbsp;That is particularly true where, as here, counsel for one accused has suggested unmistakably to the jury that the guilt of a co‑accused may be inferred from that person’s failure to testify.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of principle, there is no reason why counsel whose client has testified cannot refer to that fact and suggest this indicates the client is innocent and has “nothing to hide”. &nbsp;Counsel may certainly emphasize as well that the client’s testimony stands uncontradicted, even when the client asserts his or her own innocence and imputes guilt to the co-accused. &nbsp;The right to make full answer and defence is not constrained by the unfavourable impact its effective exercise may have on others in jeopardy of conviction. &nbsp;However, it is not absolute and cannot be exercised with total disregard for the constitutional rights of a co‑accused, including that person’s right not to have his or her silence treated as evidence of guilt.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the absence of a remedial direction is sufficient to require a new trial.&nbsp; Moreover, that error was exacerbated by the erroneous admission of hearsay evidence. &nbsp;On any view of the matter, neither of the errors committed by the trial judge can be characterized as trivial.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the Crown has not satisfied its onerous burden in invoking the curative proviso<i>.</i></p>

V, at p. 17).&nbsp; That comment was improper in that it implicitly invited the jury to treat Mr. Prokofiew’s silence at trial as evidence of guilt.&nbsp; It should not have been made.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite his strong language, I consider it significant that neither the trial judge, on his own motion, nor counsel who was acting for Mr. Prokofiew at the time, raised the prospect of severance.&nbsp; The option of severing Mr. Prokofiew’s trial from Mr. Solty’s was clearly open if the trial judge believed that severance was warranted in the interests of justice: <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec591subsec3" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec591subsec3" target="_blank">, s. 591(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>b</i>) — and it would have solved the problem if, as Mr. Prokofiew now argues and my colleague accepts, the risk identified by the trial judge was so great that it could not be overcome by instructions tailored to address, albeit indirectly, the erroneous message conveyed by Mr. Solty’s counsel.&nbsp; Presumably, Mr. Prokofiew’s trial counsel ascribed to the view that the judge’s instructions to the jury would suffice, and thus refrained from moving for severance.&nbsp; I prefer to view the matter that way, rather than to treat his failure to move for severance as a tactical decision designed to preserve a ground of appeal should things go badly at trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the trial judge, I cannot accept that he would have allowed the trial against Mr. Prokofiew to proceed if he truly believed that the impugned remarks had irretrievably compromised Mr. Prokofiew’s fair trial rights.&nbsp; On the contrary, I am satisfied that he proceeded — with the acquiescence of Mr. Prokofiew’s trial counsel — on the belief that he could disabuse the jury of the notion that Mr. Prokofiew’s silence at trial could be used as evidence of his guilt.&nbsp; And that, in my view, is precisely what the trial judge proceeded to do.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague states that the trial judge’s instructions “left [the jury] to determine for themselves, with no assistance from the judge, the evidentiary and legal effect of Mr. Prokofiew’s failure to testify at trial” (para. 87).&nbsp; He further contends that, absent an explicit instruction from the trial judge, “[w]e have no basis for supposing that the jury understood . . . which [of the two] counsel had stated the law correctly” (para. 89).&nbsp; With respect, I do not share his view that the jury was left on its own without guidance, relegated in the end to choose, presumably as a matter of guesswork, which of the two counsel had accurately stated the law.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[17]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the jury was told by the trial judge that he (the trial judge) was supreme in the law and that they must take the law from him.&nbsp; The jury was also told that if they had questions, they were to put the questions in writing and the trial judge would answer them in open court.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of those instructions, I believe that if the jury had been faced with the quandary my colleague poses — as to which of the two counsel, who had made “diametrically opposite submissions on a fundamental principle of law” (para. 88), they should believe — they would have asked the trial judge for clarification.&nbsp; I do not accept that they would have left the matter to guesswork or any other form of conduct that would indicate that the jury was being untrue to its oath.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it is, the jury did not ask a question about the two “diametrically opposite submissions”.&nbsp; That leads to a second area of disagreement with my colleague.&nbsp; It relates to the instructions the jury received and whether those instructions, though not explicit, were sufficient to overcome the risk that the trial judge had flagged — that the jury would use Mr. Prokofiew’s silence at trial as evidence of guilt.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated, my colleague maintains that the jury received no assistance from the trial judge in this regard.&nbsp; They were “left free”, he maintains, “to treat Mr. Prokofiew’s failure to testify as evidence of his guilt and to convict him, at least in part, for that reason” (para. 92).&nbsp; With respect, I disagree.&nbsp; I prefer instead Doherty J.A.’s analysis of the instructions, and his conclusion that, considered in their entirety, the jury would have understood that the Crown could prove Mr. Prokofiew’s guilt only on the evidence, that his silence at trial did not constitute evidence, and that it could therefore not be used to infer guilt.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Doherty J.A. points out, the trial judge made it clear to the jury that the Crown carried the burden of proof throughout the proceedings and that there was no obligation on the part of Mr. Prokofiew to present evidence or prove anything.&nbsp; The trial judge also emphasized that the jury was to base its verdict on the evidence given during the trial and nothing else.&nbsp; Importantly, he defined “evidence” as being “[o]nly things that are admitted, the exhibits and the things witnesses say in testimony before you” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 143).&nbsp; Like Doherty J.A., I believe the jury would have understood from this that Mr. Prokofiew’s silence did not constitute evidence, and, as such, it could not be used in determining his guilt.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague points out that the trial judge did not give an explicit instruction to the jury about the impropriety of using Mr. Prokofiew’s silence at trial as evidence of guilt.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; However, I do not agree that the jury received no assistance from the trial judge on the matter.&nbsp; On the contrary, I am satisfied that the trial judge implicitly endorsed the remarks Mr. Prokofiew’s counsel made in direct response to the improper remarks made by Mr. Solty’s counsel.&nbsp; At the very least, the trial judge went a long way in that direction.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to the impugned remarks, counsel for Mr. Prokofiew juxtaposed other jurisdictions in the world where accused persons were required to disprove their guilt with the situation in Canada:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not, thankfully, the way things are done here in Canada.&nbsp; We have the luxury and we have the thankfulness that we have a system that requires the State to prove our guilt before a conviction or a finding of guilt can be entered.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this situation, this is the situation why Mr. Prokofiew does not have to call evidence, and this is why Mr. Prokofiew did not call evidence. [A.R., vol. V, at p. 27]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge picked up on this theme and endorsed it as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Solty and Mr. Prokofiew do not have to present evidence or prove anything in this case.&nbsp; In particular, they do not have to prove that they are innocent of the crimes charged [<i>sic</i>].&nbsp; From start to finish, it is the Crown that must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; It is Crown counsel who must prove Mr. Solty’s guilt and/or Mr. Prokofiew’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not Mr. Prokofiew or Mr. Solty who must prove their innocence. [A.R., vol. V, at p. 133]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Doherty J.A. observed that this jury instruction “tied the presumption of innocence into the burden of proof in a manner that spoke almost directly to the irrelevance of the appellant’s failure to testify” (para. 49).&nbsp; I agree.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, while I agree that an explicit remedial instruction from the trial judge would have been preferable — and would have been warranted in these circumstances — I am satisfied that the instructions that were given in the instant case, when considered as a whole, were adequate.&nbsp; Like Doherty J.A., I am confident that the jury would have understood, in the context of the entirety of the instructions, that the Crown could prove Mr. Prokofiew’s guilt only on the evidence and, as Mr. Prokofiew’s silence at trial did not constitute evidence, it could not be used to prove his guilt.&nbsp; However, I do not fault the trial judge for concluding — wrongly but understandably — that he was prohibited by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec4subsec6" target="_blank">s. 4(6)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">CEA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> from making any reference at all to Mr. Prokofiew’s failure to testify.&nbsp; My colleague has addressed that matter and it should not pose a problem in future cases.</p>

Solty and Tulloch (the latter being a co-accused who had pled guilty before the trial of Messrs. Solty and Prokofiew and had since become a Crown witness).&nbsp; The jury was told to proceed with caution and to look for confirmatory evidence before acting on their testimony to convict Mr. Prokofiew.&nbsp; Depending on their assessment of the cheque stubs and deposit book, the jury was instructed that those items could constitute confirmatory evidence of Mr. Tulloch’s testimony, which in turn would bear on the jury’s evaluation of Mr. Solty’s credibility.&nbsp; Hence, according to my colleague, the error was not harmless, because the jury “may [have relied] on the impugned evidence to take a small but critical first step in a chain of deductions leading to a finding of guilt” (para.&nbsp;111).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was uncontested at trial that the scheme was fraudulent and that Mr. Prokofiew and Mr. Solty had both participated in it.&nbsp; The only live issue was whether they were aware of its fraudulent nature.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Solty testified that he was an innocent participant.&nbsp; He was induced, he said, to participate in the fraud by Mr. Prokofiew, who orchestrated the scheme.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s clear that Mr. Solty never ran and [n]ever tried to hide from his involvement in this case. . . . &nbsp;And when it came to his turn to tell his side of the story, he did not, like Ewaryst Prokofiew, shirk from that challenge. And why did he do all this? Especially when there was absent no obligation for him to do anything? Because, I suggest, he had nothing to hide. Because he’s innocent. Innocent people don’t make themselves scarce when the troubles begin. They stand up with their friends and colleagues and try and deal with the problem. I suggest to you that at every turn, Peter Solty acted in a manner that is consistent with an innocent person.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" align="center" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:
center">. . .</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Lastly, Peter Solty took the stand and told his story, warts and all. Ewaryst Prokofiew did not. Mr. Solty accused him of massive monetary fraud, and backed up that accusation with the hand-written invoices and other documentation that he provided to the police. What was Mr. Prokofiew’s response? Ask yourself why Ewaryst Prokofiew did not testify. Did he have something to hide or did he simply have no response that could help him since there is no point in trying to contradict the truth? [A.R., vol. V, at pp. 10-11 and 16-17]</p>

As earlier mentioned, he felt there was a “significant risk” that the jury would infer that Mr. Prokofiew’s silence could be taken as evidence of guilt, in contravention of <i>R. v. Noble</i>,<i> </i>[1997] 1 S.C.R. 874 (A.R., vol.&nbsp;I, at p. 7).&nbsp; It was therefore necessary, said the judge, to make clear to the jury that no such inference was permitted — “that they may not consider Mr. Prokofiew’s silence . . . as indicative of [his] guilt” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 92).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that Sopinka J. did state in <i>Noble </i>and <i>Crawford</i> that s. 4(6) prohibits any mention of the accused’s failure to testify.&nbsp; However, Doherty J.A., speaking for a unanimous Court, found that Justice Sopinka’s statements to this effect in both <i>Noble </i>and <i>Crawford</i> were <i>obiter dicta</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Doherty recognized that lower courts should presume that <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Supreme Court are binding upon them (para. 21).&nbsp; And he then proceeded to explain, persuasively and with care, why that presumption was inapplicable in this instance.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Doherty first noted that the impugned <i>obiter dicta</i> were plainly inconsistent with the <i>ratio decidendi </i>of decisions predating <i>Crawford </i>and <i>Noble —</i> in particular, <i>McConnell v. The Queen</i>, [1968] S.C.R. 802, and <i>Avon v. The Queen</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 650.</p>

Yet to do so here would have the opposite effect.&nbsp; It would disregard precedent that was not questioned in <i>Crawford</i>,<i> Noble</i> or subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court — and, indeed, applied recently and consistently at the appellate level in Ontario, and elsewhere in Canada (para. 29, citing, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>R. v.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal recognized that “no one knows for sure what the jury used or did not use”, but found that the absence of a remedial instruction would only be fatal where the “appellant shows a real risk that his silence was misused” (para. 42).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding that Mr. Prokofiew had not discharged that burden, the Court of Appeal pointed to various passages of the judge’s charge.&nbsp; Essentially, in the passages considered by the Court of Appeal (paras. 46-48), the trial judge instructed the jury that their verdict must be based on “the evidence put before you, and only on that evidence” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 125); that both Mr. Prokofiew and Mr. Solty were presumed innocent throughout the trial; that they did not have to prove their innocence; and that the presumption of their innocence “is only defeated if and when Crown counsel has satisfied all of you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that either or both Mr. Prokofiew and Mr. Solty are guilty of either or both of the crimes with which they are each charged” (p. 132).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on the entirety of the judge’s instructions, and notably on the instructions mentioned, the court was satisfied “that the jury would understand that the Crown could prove the appellant’s guilt based only on the evidence, and that the appellant’s silence at trial ― or indeed, any other non-evidentiary matter ― could not be used to infer the appellant’s guilt” (para. 51).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal also characterized as a “direct response” (para. 44) to the prejudicial comments by counsel for Mr. Solty, the following passages from the closing address of counsel for Mr. Prokofiew:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Prokofiew, as [counsel for Mr. Solty] pointed out, chose not to testify in this case. There are many jurisdictions in the world that are, frankly, not as kind as ours; that when a person has an allegation against them, that they have to stand up; you’re alleged to do this; or you prove to us, you tell us why you are not guilty. That is not, thankfully, the way things are done here in Canada. We have the luxury and we have the thankfulness that we have a system that requires the State to prove our guilt before a conviction or a finding of guilt can be entered.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this situation, this is the situation why Mr. Prokofiew does not have to call evidence, and this is why Mr. Prokofiew did not call evidence. In the context of [counsel for Mr. Solty’s] statement, well, yes, Mr. Solty testified, but with respect, Mr. Solty had no choice but to testify. He was implicated at every turn of these transactions. He was in transactions up to his neck. And as a result, with respect to him, he had no choice but to take the stand. In response to Mr. Prokofiew, as I will mention in my submission, the evidence comes down to the evidence of Mr. Tulloch, and juxtaposed by the evidence of Peter Solty. With the greatest respect to them, their evidence does not come close to establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in this case. And in the context of what Mr. Solty testified to will simply adjust the position of the evidence of Mr. Tulloch. Nothing more, nothing less. [A.R., vol. V, at pp. 27-28]</p>

Daley</i>,<i> </i>2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 58).&nbsp; However, we are not dealing in this case with a failure by the trial judge to mention evidence that is brought to the jury’s attention by counsel in their closing submissions.&nbsp; Nor are we concerned with uncontested or uncontroversial matters inadvertently omitted from the judge’s charge.&nbsp; Or with any other gap of the kind contemplated by <i>Daley</i>.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that the addresses of counsel may in some circumstances adequately complement the judge’s charge.&nbsp; But that cannot be so where counsel for two antagonistic accused make diametrically opposite submissions on a fundamental principle of law, as in this case.</p>

The jury had no informed reason to believe one lawyer rather than the other.&nbsp; The guiding hand of the trial judge was essential — and absent.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most importantly, <i>neither</i> the judge’s instructions cited by the Court of Appeal <i>nor</i> the comments by counsel for Mr. Prokofiew address the impermissibility of drawing an adverse inference from Mr. Prokofiew’s silence.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[92]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impugned comments by Mr. Solty’s counsel, as the trial judge recognized, cried out for an explicit, remedial instruction.&nbsp; They received no remedial instruction at all.&nbsp; I agree with the Court of Appeal that “no one knows for sure what the jury used or did not use” (para. 42).&nbsp; What we do know for sure is that they were left free to treat Mr. Prokofiew’s failure to testify as evidence of his guilt and to convict him, at least in part, for that reason.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[93]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my respectful view, this alone is fatal to their verdict.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[94]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Trial judges must take care to ensure that the right to silence becomes neither a snare nor a delusion (<i>Noble</i>, at para. 72). &nbsp;To this end, whenever there is a “significant risk” ― as the trial judge found in this case ― that the jury will otherwise treat the silence of the accused as evidence of guilt, an appropriate remedial direction ought to be given to the jury. That was not done here.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[95]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standard instructions on the definition of evidence, the presumption of innocence, the Crown’s burden of proof, and the reasonable doubt standard will not suffice.&nbsp; That is particularly true where, as here, counsel for one accused has suggested unmistakably to the jury that the guilt of a co-accused may be inferred from that person’s failure to testify.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is now well established that the <i>proviso</i> may only be applied where the Crown satisfies the court that the evidence of the appellant’s guilt is overwhelming or that the trial judge’s errors of law were harmless because there is “no realistic possibility that a new trial would produce a different verdict” (<i>R. v. Jolivet</i>,<i> </i>2000 SCC 29, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, at para. 46; <i>R. v. Sarrazin</i>, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at paras. 23-24).&nbsp; I am not satisfied that the Crown has discharged its burden in this case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal held that the case against Mr. Prokofiew was “overwhelming” (para. 57).&nbsp; This conclusion overlooks the fact that the strength of the Crown’s case depends on the credibility of the two witnesses who incriminated Mr. Prokofiew, both disreputable.&nbsp; And it rests on the assumption that neither of the judge’s errors of law has any bearing on their credibility, tainted to begin with.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I refer, of course, to the co-accused, Mr. Solty, and to Andrew Tulloch, a Crown witness. Mr. Tulloch had pleaded guilty prior to the trial.&nbsp; They alone asserted that Mr. Prokofiew was the architect of the fraudulent scheme.&nbsp; None of the Crown’s other witnesses had dealt with Mr. Prokofiew directly or were able to attest to his knowing participation in the fraud. Some documentary evidence demonstrated Mr. Prokofiew’s involvement in the transactions.&nbsp; But nothing in the documents or elsewhere — independent of Mr. Solty and Mr. Tulloch’s testimony — showed conclusively that he conducted them with fraudulent intent.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was, of course, open to the jury to consider the testimony of Mr. Solty and Mr. Tulloch credible.&nbsp; Quite properly, however, the trial judge warned the jury against resting its verdict on their uncorroborated evidence.&nbsp; Mr. Tulloch was a<i> Vetrovec</i> witness (<i>Vetrovec v. The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1982] 1 S.C.R. 811).&nbsp; The trial judge therefore instructed the jury that it would be “dangerous” to rely on his testimony absent confirmatory evidence (A.R., vol. V, at p. 160).&nbsp; The trial judge also cautioned the jury against relying on Mr. Solty’s evidence when considering the case against Mr. Prokofiew:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should consider that testimony of Mr. Solty with particular care, because he may have been more concerned about protecting himself and damaging Mr. Prokofiew than in telling the truth. [A.R., vol. V, at p. 156]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, counsel for Mr. Prokofiew suggested at trial that Mr. Solty was motivated by a powerful animus against Mr. Prokofiew: Mr. Solty was aware that Mr. Prokofiew had had an affair with Mr. Solty’s wife.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When confronted with tainted witnesses of this sort, triers of fact must act on their evidence with caution (<i>Vetrovec</i>; <i>R. v. Bevan</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599; <i>R. v. Kehler</i>, 2004 SCC 11, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 328).&nbsp; Accordingly, they will not lightly accept the unsupported assertions of potentially unreliable witnesses where little but the word of those witnesses implicates the accused in the commission of the crime charged (<i>Kehler</i>, at para. 17; <i>Bevan</i>, at pp. 614-15; <i>R. v. Brooks</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 661 (C.A.), at pp. 694-95).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And when such witnesses are central to the Crown’s case, as they were here, corroboration becomes particularly significant.&nbsp; In this regard, an evidential error that might otherwise appear insignificant raises particular concern when it goes to the credibility of potentially unreliable witnesses.&nbsp; Unaware of its erroneous admission, the trier of fact may rely on the impugned evidence to take a small but critical first step in a chain of deductions leading to a finding of guilt.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[112]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On any view of the matter, neither of the errors committed by the trial judge can be characterized as trivial.&nbsp; As I have already mentioned, the absence of a remedial direction is in my view sufficient to require a new trial.&nbsp; That error was exacerbated by the erroneous admission of hearsay evidence.&nbsp; In his charge to the jury, the trial judge referred to that evidence as tending to corroborate the evidence of Mr. Tulloch (A.R., vol. V, at p. 161).&nbsp; If they found that it did, this would likely bear as well on the jury’s evaluation of the credibility of Mr. Solty, whose evidence, the trial judge said, was in turn corroborated by Mr. Tulloch’s (A.R., vol. V, at p. 161).&nbsp; And the acceptance of their evidence, I repeat, was essential to the Crown’s case against Mr. Prokofiew.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[113]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, the Crown cannot be said to have satisfied its onerous burden in invoking the curative <i>proviso</i> of s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</i></p>
