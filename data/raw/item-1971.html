 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The motions judge reached this conclusion prematurely.&nbsp; While there are undoubtedly some obstacles to the admission of R‚Äôs evidence, it is not clear that it will be inadmissible.&nbsp; First, there is a significant degree of necessity to her testimony, in that, absent a successful <i>McClure</i> application, it is the only evidence of the appellant‚Äôs confession, which may exculpate the accused.&nbsp; Second, it may be considered sufficiently reliable to be admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; Finally, there is some potential that the confession to R may be admissible as a declaration against penal interest.&nbsp; The motions judge ought to have held a <i>voir dire</i> to determine the admissibility of R‚Äôs hearsay testimony before concluding that the requested information was not available from another source.&nbsp; If it is found to be admissible, then the <i>McClure</i> application should fail on the threshold question because the requested information is available from another source as admissible evidence.&nbsp; Furthermore, prior to ruling on the <i>McClure</i> application, the motions judge should have decided whether the appellant waived his solicitor-client privilege by telling R about his solicitor-client communications.&nbsp; Only if the motions judge had concluded that there was no waiver and that R‚Äôs testimony was inadmissible should he have proceeded to the other elements of the <i>McClure </i>test.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The motions judge erred in reaching his conclusion that the accused could not raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt in any other way.&nbsp; Although it is too early to decide the issue, with only circumstantial evidence it is speculative that the Crown could prove its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The only other evidence that may implicate the accused is that of the jailhouse informant who allegedly overheard the accused confessing to another inmate.&nbsp; As there has yet been no decision to call the informant to testify, it would be premature to conclude that the accused will be unable to raise a reasonable doubt without invading the appellant‚Äôs solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The motions judge applied the first stage of the innocence at stake test correctly.&nbsp; There was a sufficient evidentiary basis to find that some solicitor-client communications exist.&nbsp; Further, the solicitor-client communications, if they exist, are capable of raising a reasonable doubt as to the accused‚Äôs guilt.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">After all, while the circumstances when the privilege should give way are narrow, the rationale for setting aside the privilege is clear:&nbsp; the privilege will yield where it stands in the way of an innocent person establishing his or her innocence.&nbsp; Viewed in that light, it becomes apparent that where the accused has <u>information</u> about a fact, but the solicitor‚Äôs file will yield <u>evidence</u> of that fact, and the <u>evidence</u> is not otherwise available, then the prerequisite is met.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Dambrot J. found that Brown had established a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which to conclude that the privileged communication exists.&nbsp; Robertson‚Äôs statement to the police suggested that Benson had confessed to Mr. Greenspan and that he, in turn, had recommended Mr. Copeland and Mr. Ducharme to him.&nbsp; In addition, Robertson had produced the business card with instructions purporting to invoke the right to silence in the face of police questioning.&nbsp; Dambrot J. also found that Benson‚Äôs confession, if it exists, was capable of raising a reasonable doubt as to Brown‚Äôs guilt.&nbsp; Therefore, Brown had satisfied the first element of the innocence at stake test.&nbsp; Dambrot J. accordingly ordered that the relevant files be produced to the court for examination.</p>

Proulx and D. Layton in <i>Ethics and Canadian Criminal Law</i> (2001), a lawyer cannot disclose privileged communications unless ordered to do so by a court, even though ‚Äú[o]ften the lawyer will alone be aware of the exculpatory information, meaning that no other interested party has any reason or basis to invoke the court process in order to defeat the privilege‚Äù (p. 183).</p>

Williams</i> (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 321, that this requirement may be relaxed in some circumstances.&nbsp; In that case, Martin J.A. discussed the United States Supreme Court decision of <i>Chambers v. Mississippi</i>, 410 U.S. 284 (1973), where the court found that confessions made by a third party were admissible, notwithstanding that the third party declarant was available and, in fact, did testify at the accused‚Äôs trial.&nbsp; Powell J. noted, at pp. 300-301, that the statements were made ‚Äúunder circumstances that provided considerable assurance of their reliability‚Äù, and that, ‚Äúwhatever may be the parameters of the penal-interest rationale, each confession here was in a very real sense self-incriminatory and unquestionably against interest‚Äù.</p>

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">The disclosure of the privileged communication should generally be limited as much as possible.&nbsp; The judge setting aside the solicitor-client privilege should strive to strictly limit disclosure to those aspects of the report or document which indicate that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily harm or death to an identifiable person or group.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The requirement that the disclosure be limited must be emphasized.&nbsp; For example, if a report contained references to criminal behaviour that did not have an imminent risk of serious bodily harm but disclosed, for example, the commission of crimes of fraud, counterfeiting or the sale of stolen goods, those references would necessarily be deleted.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">Any state action that coerces an individual to furnish evidence against him- or herself in a proceeding in which the individual and the state are adversaries violates the principle against self-incrimination.&nbsp; Coercion, it should be noted, means the denial of free and informed consent.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The Chief Justice also noted that the rationale for the principle was rooted in two other principles:&nbsp; ‚Äú(1) protection against unreliable confessions; and (2) protection against the abuse of power by the state‚Äù (p. 250).&nbsp; While Lamer C.J. was in dissent in <i>Jones</i>, the above principles have been cited by this Court in subsequent cases, <i>infra</i>, and ought to be taken as authoritative.</p>

White</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, where he concluded that mandatory reporting of motor vehicle accidents did bring the principle against self-incrimination into play.</p>

Berger, <i>Taking the Fifth:&nbsp; The Supreme Court and the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination</i> (1980), at p. 70.&nbsp; More importantly, it would unnecessarily compromise the public interest in bringing criminals to justice.</p>
