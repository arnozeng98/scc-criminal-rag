(dissenting):&nbsp; Since the accused was deprived at his trial of the presumption of innocence and the right to remain silent, his conviction cannot stand.&nbsp; The trial judge drew an adverse inference from the fingerprint evidence in this case, and required the accused to provide an innocent explanation for it.&nbsp; This affected the presumption of innocence because the Crown was thereby relieved of its burden of establishing possession by the accused of the LSD contained in the plastic bag.&nbsp; The right to remain silent was infringed by the implied requirement that the accused had to explain the presence of his fingerprints on the plastic bag.</span></p>

Johnson</i> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 340 (C.A.), at pp. 347-48, is on point:</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">No adverse inference can be drawn if there is no case to answer.&nbsp; A weak prosecution's case cannot be strengthened by the failure of the accused to testify.&nbsp; But there seems to come a time, where, in the words of Irving J.A. in <i>R. v. Jenkins</i> (1908), 14 C.C.C. 221 at p. 230, 14 B.C.R. 61 (C.A.), "circumstantial evidence having enveloped a man in a strong and cogent network of inculpatory facts, that man is bound to make some explanation or stand condemned".&nbsp; That point, it seems to me, can only be the point where the prosecution's evidence, standing alone, is such that it would support a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Viewed that way, it would be better said that the absence of defence evidence, including the failure of the accused to testify, justifies the conclusion that no foundation for a reasonable doubt could be found on the evidence.&nbsp; <u>It is not so much that the failure to testify justifies an inference of guilt;&nbsp; it is rather that it fails to provide any basis to conclude otherwise</u>.&nbsp; When linked in that fashion to the strength of the Crown's case, the failure to testify is no different than the failure to call other defence evidence. . . . If the Crown's case cries out for an explanation, an accused must be prepared to accept the adverse consequences of his decision to remain silent:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Boss</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523, 68 C.R. (3d) 123 (C.A.), at p. 542 C.C.C., p. 42 [<i>sic</i>] C.R.&nbsp; But the failure to testify cannot be used as simply one of the circumstances from which the guilt of the accused can be inferred: <i>R. v. Armstrong</i> (1989), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 190 . . . As Doherty J. pointed out in <i>R. v. Manchev</i>, an unreported judgment of the Ontario High Court, August 23, 1990, the accused's failure to testify is not an independent piece of evidence, to be placed on the evidentiary scale.&nbsp; It is rather a feature of the trial which may assist in deciding what inferences should be drawn from the evidence adduced.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

(as he then was) wrote for this Court in <i>Morris v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, at pp. 201-2:</span></p>

(at p. 45) that the trial judge did believe Thelland's testimony "at least to the extent that he did not own the L.S.D., otherwise she would have been obliged to acquit" the respondent.&nbsp; Pardu J. does not explain why she accepted some of Thelland's evidence in view of her comment about his tarnished credibility.&nbsp; Given the importance of Thelland's testimony in supplementing the fingerprint evidence to support the verdict, it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have explained more clearly which part of his evidence she accepted and for what reasons.&nbsp; Nonetheless, her failure to do so does not amount to an error of law.&nbsp; See <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The underlined portions demonstrate, in my view, the essential nature of Thelland's testimony as relating solely to the character and disposition of the accused, rather than to the specific facts of the offence with which he was charged. Thelland did not testify that he had seen Lepage handle the bag of LSD or have the bag in his possession. He did not testify that he saw Lepage place the bag under the couch. Nor did he testify that Lepage had admitted possessing the LSD. The only purpose of this evidence in my view was to show the disposition of the accused, or his propensity to traffic in narcotics and associate with dealers. This is an impermissible purpose. </span></p>

B. (F.F.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697. In Justice Sopinka's view, the evidence of Thelland was relevant not solely to character, but also to possession, in that someone in the business of dealing narcotics had more opportunity and was more likely to be in possession of narcotics. With respect, this is evidence of propensity to deal in drugs, and nothing more. This is what is precluded by the general exclusion of character evidence. The accused is only forced to stand trial for the transactions forming the subject matter of the charge for which he is being tried. The Crown must therefore&nbsp; demonstrate more than a "likelihood" or "opportunity" arising from the past history of the accused. It must demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this accused person was in possession of the drugs which form the subject matter of the charge. The testimony of Thelland, in my view, could not assist the Crown in this respect. The prejudicial effect of such testimony would clearly outweigh its minimal probative value with respect to the charge of possession for the purposes of trafficking.</span></p>

If she did rely on it in coming to her decision, this was an error of law. However, there remained the evidence of the fingerprints on the plastic bag containing the LSD to consider. Once Thelland's testimony is excluded, the fingerprints are the only evidence against the respondent. It is my opinion that this evidence is not sufficient, and that the trial judge erred in concluding that the respondent should have provided an explanation for the presence of the fingerprints on the plastic bag and impliedly drawing an adverse inference from his failure to do so.</span></p>

O'Keefe</i> (1958), 121 C.C.C. 273 (Ont. C.A.), as does my colleague in his reasons. In that case, the accused was charged with breaking and entering and committing theft. The only evidence of possession of the goods by the accused was his fingerprints on the stolen goods. The Court of Appeal was unanimous in concluding that the trial judge erred in not giving effect to the explanation of the accused that he had innocently handled the goods, not knowing that they were stolen. However, the majority (Morden and Lebel JJ.A.) of the Court found that the fingerprints founded a prima facie case of possession in law against the appellant, which could be rebutted by his explanation. Laidlaw J.A., on the other hand, had this to say, at p. 279:</span></p>

That fact alone does not raise any presumption that they came into his possession in a dishonest or unlawful manner. The inference cannot be drawn from that fact alone that he had any control whatsoever in respect of the stolen goods. Indeed, the mere fact of handling stolen goods and leaving fingerprints on them is equally consistent with innocence as with any wrongful act in respect of them. </span></p>

In <i>R. v. Bowes</i> (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 367 (N.B.C.A.), the accused's fingerprints were found on a stolen object, a fibreglass globe located on a post on the property of the complainant. Ryan J.A. for the court followed the majority's reasoning in <i>O'Keefe</i> and held that the trial judge ought to have found that the accused was in possession of the object due to the presence of the fingerprints. In <i>Bowes</i>, however, there was no reasonable innocent explanation for the presence of the fingerprints on the globe, and they were found on the stolen object itself rather than on the container. </span></p>

The Queen</i> (1956), 116 C.C.C. 306 (N.B.C.A.), the fingerprints of the accused, charged with break and enter, were found on the inside of a broken window. No explanation was offered by the accused. The Court of Appeal held that the magistrate was entitled, as a question of fact, to draw an inference of guilt from the fingerprint evidence. In <i>Dufresne v. The Queen</i> (1966), 50 C.R. 208 (Que. C.A.), the accused was convicted of armed robbery largely on the basis of the presence of a fingerprint on the rear view mirror of the stolen car used to commit the offence. In the absence of any explanation, the jury was entitled to infer that the accused had participated in the crime, and the weight of the fingerprint evidence was a question for the jury. Choquette J.A. for the court explicitly recognized that this was not a case where it was necessary to prove possession of stolen goods. In <i>R. v. Keller</i> (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 360 (Sask. C.A.), the fingerprints of the accused were found on a matchbook cover recovered near a safe which had been opened by a cutting torch.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">63</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more recent decision, <i>R. v. Mehrabnia</i> (1993), 26 C.R. (4th) 98, (Ont. Ct. (Prov. Div.)), considered this issue in the context of a preliminary inquiry into charges of possession of heroin for the purposes of trafficking. The only evidence against one of the accused was a palm print on a piece of tissue paper which had been used to wrap the bags of heroin. There was no evidence connecting the accused with the premises where the heroin was found, nor of any relationship with the other accused who resided at those premises.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">64</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fairgrieve Prov. J. concluded that this evidence was not sufficient to commit the accused for trial. After reviewing the case law, including the decisions mentioned above, Fairgrieve Prov. J. stated, at pp. 106-7:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">. . . I think that the principle that emerges from all these cases is that whether an accused's fingerprint on an article will support an inference that he was in possession of the article will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. The nature of the article will clearly be of significance, such that a fingerprint on a frying pan, as in <i>O'Keefe</i>, for example, would much more readily establish possession of that item than a fingerprint on a container, such as the bottle in <i>Kuhn (No. 1)</i>, which might prove prior handling of the bottle, but not necessarily knowledge and control of its contents at the relevant time. Whether the further inference of possession would be available would presumably depend on the presence or absence of such evidence as when the fingerprint was placed on the bottle, whether the contents could be seen when handling the bottle, or whether the nature of the substance in the container was readily recognizable.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">65</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An adverse inference may be drawn from the failure to testify in certain circumstances, namely where the Crown has already adduced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case supporting a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the accused does not adduce evidence in such a case, he or she is at risk of conviction. As Arbour J.A. explained in <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 340 (C.A.), at pp. 347-48:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">No adverse inference can be drawn if there is no case to answer. A weak prosecution's case cannot be strengthened by the failure of the accused to testify. But there seems to come a time, where, in the words of Irving J.A. in <i>R. v. Jenkins</i> (1908) 14 C.C.C. 221 at p. 230, 14 B.C.R. 61 (C.A.), "circumstantial evidence having enveloped a man in a strong and cogent network of inculpatory facts, that man is bound to make some explanation or stand condemned". <u>That point, it seems to me, can only be the point where the prosecution's evidence, standing alone, is such that it would support a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Viewed that way, it would be better said that the absence of defence evidence, including the failure of the accused to testify, justifies the conclusion that no foundation for a reasonable doubt could be found on the evidence</u>. It is not so much that the failure to testify justifies an inference of guilt; it is rather that it fails to provide any basis to conclude otherwise.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">66</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, there was a foundation in law for reasonable doubt in this case given that all three tenants of the house had access to the kitchen drawers where plastic bags similar to that containing the LSD were kept. It was thus possible that the respondent had innocently handled the bag in the kitchen prior to its use as a container for the LSD. The fingerprints on the container were not sufficient, in and of themselves, to draw an inference of guilt requiring the accused to provide an explanation. </span></p>

In the circumstances of the case at bar, however, I would conclude that the inference should not be drawn. The fingerprints were on the container, rather than on the prohibited substance. That container could have been handled by the respondent in an innocent manner. There was no other evidence, aside from the inadmissible character evidence of Thelland, which would link the respondent to the possession of the LSD found under the couch, in a common area of a house shared by two other individuals. This was not a case where the presence of fingerprints on the container was sufficient to meet the burden resting on the Crown.</span></p>
