The police investigated the complaint the evening it was made and videotaped the complainant’s statement describing the incident.&nbsp; At trial, the complainant was shown the videotape following her examination‑in‑chief.&nbsp; She identified herself in the videotape, confirmed that she made the statements on the videotape and that they were true.&nbsp; The trial judge ruled that the complainant had adopted the videotaped statement and admitted it as evidence pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec715.1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;715.1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; On cross‑examination the complainant made statements which contradicted in part the videotaped statements.&nbsp; The Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the conviction and directed a new trial at the discretion of the Crown.&nbsp; At issue here were the requirements for the admissibility of a videotaped statement under s.&nbsp;715.1 and the effect of an inconsistency between the child’s <i>viva voce</i> evidence and her videotaped statement. Also at issue was whether a <i>voir dire</i> should have been held with respect to the admissibility of the complainant’s videotaped statement.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Once the trial judge rules that the statement has been adopted, the video becomes evidence of the events described as if the child were giving the statements on the videotape in open court.&nbsp; An adopted videotaped statement should, together with the <i>viva voce</i> evidence given at trial, comprise the whole of the evidence‑in‑chief of the complainant.&nbsp; Any questions which arise concerning the circumstances in which the video was made, the veracity of the witnesses’ statements, or the overall reliability of the evidence, are matters for the trier of fact to consider in determining how much weight the videotaped statement should be given. Parts of the video contradicted during cross‑examination are not rendered inadmissible but may well be given less weight in the final determination of the issues.&nbsp; The fact that the video is contradicted in cross‑examination does not necessarily mean that the video is wrong or unreliable.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Although it is preferable for the police to refrain, to the extent that it is reasonably possible, from interviewing the complainant before the videotaped statement is recorded, the ultimate reliability of the videotaped statement is not a question which should be resolved at the <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; The fact that a pre‑video interview was conducted, and any effect it may have had on the subsequently videotaped statement, should go to the weight to be accorded the evidence and not to its admissibility.&nbsp; The police officers conducting the videotaped interview should pose simple, open‑ended questions to the child.&nbsp; In some situations, however, it will be necessary and appropriate to ask leading questions.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

L. (D.O.)</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, the constitutional validity of s.&nbsp;715.1 was considered.&nbsp; The section was unanimously held to be constitutionally valid.&nbsp; Chief Justice Lamer, writing for six members of the Court, made this comment upon the aim and purpose of the section at p.&nbsp;429:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

R. Spencer, “Do Children Forget Faster?”, [1991] <i>Crim. L.R.</i> 189, at p.&nbsp;190.)&nbsp; It follows that the videotape which is made within a reasonable time after the alleged offence and which describes the act will almost inevitably reflect a more accurate recollection of events than will testimony given later at trial. Thus the section enhances the ability of a court to find the truth by preserving a very recent recollection of the event in question.</p>

McAuliff, “The Use of Videotaped Child Testimony:&nbsp; Public Policy Implications” (1993), 7 <i>Notre Dame J.L. Ethics &amp; Pub. Pol’y</i> 387).&nbsp; As the authors state, at p.&nbsp;420:</p>

The King</i>, [1947] S.C.R. 531).&nbsp; Initially, the conditions that had to exist before a witness could “adopt” a prior inconsistent statement were not considered by the courts.&nbsp; Instead, judges relied upon their assessment of the witness’ demeanor and reaction upon being confronted with a prior statement to determine whether the witness adopted it as true.</p>

Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, and <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, that cross‑examination is not the only guarantee of reliability.&nbsp; There are several factors present in s.&nbsp;715.1 which provide the requisite reliability of the videotaped statement.&nbsp; They include:&nbsp; (a) the requirement that the statement be made within a reasonable time; (b) the trier of fact can watch the entire interview, which provides an opportunity to observe the demeanor, and assess the personality and intelligence of the child; (c) the requirement that the child attest that she was attempting to be truthful at the time that the statement was made.&nbsp; As well, the child can be cross‑examined at trial as to whether he or she was actually being truthful when the statement was made.&nbsp; These <i>indicia</i> provide enough guarantees of reliability to compensate for the inability to cross‑examine as to the forgotten events.&nbsp; Moreover, where the complainant has no independent memory of the events there is an obvious necessity for the videotaped evidence.&nbsp; In <i>Meddoui</i>, it was recommended that in such circumstances, the trier of fact should be given a special warning (similar to the one given in <i>Vetrovec v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811) of the dangers of convicting based on the videotape alone.&nbsp; In my view, this was sage advice that should be followed.</p>

Recently, an Ontario Court of Appeal decision was upheld in which the possibility of witness tainting was ruled a question of weight not admissibility: see <i>R. v. Buric</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 535.</p>
