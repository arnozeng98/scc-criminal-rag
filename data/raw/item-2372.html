I do not think the police can be put in a position where they may have to turn their back on the occupants of the vehicle without first conducting a “pat-down” search. While my conclusion that a “pat-down” search would be warranted extends the police power, it also significantly increases the interference with individual liberty occasioned by the roadblock stop. As that interference grows, arguments which are said to make the conduct justifiable must become all the more compelling. [para. 67]</p>

Phillips</i>, [[1975] 3 All E.R. 682].&nbsp; The interference with liberty must be necessary for the carrying out of the particular police duty <u>and it must be reasonable, having regard to the nature of the liberty interfered with and the importance of the public purpose served by the interference</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

(over the dissent of Dickson C.J. supported by Beetz and Chouinard JJ.). In the majority view, the public interest in combatting drunk driving outweighed the relatively minor intrusion on the lives of randomly selected members of the motoring public, and the police power of random stops was “reasonably necessary” to perform their duty to maintain public safety on the roads, an area of activity that is in any event licensed and highly regulated.</p>

Durham Regional Police Force </i>(1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 1, the Ontario Court of Appeal declined to find that a roadblock targeting a biker gang was authorized by a generalized apprehension of a potential (rather than imminent) breach of the peace.</p>

State of Florida</i>, 422 So.2d 957 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982).&nbsp; The present case is not one of “imminent danger”.&nbsp; It lacks the urgency of a kidnapping or the existence of “dangerous criminals in fresh flight” (<i>Murray</i>, at p. 203) who were “capable, indeed, of firing on pursuing officers” (<i>Murray</i>, at p. 204).&nbsp; On the other hand, a “gun call” imports a threat to public order including real concerns for the safety of the investigating officers.&nbsp; Canadian society has emphatically rejected the existence of the sort of “gun culture” that affects some societies, and rightly expects the police to be able to respond effectively to 911 “gun calls”.&nbsp; Here, the proximity in terms of place (the blockade was limited to cars exiting the property where the guns had been sighted) and proximity in time (the police were on the scene within five minutes of the 911 call) greatly increased the likelihood of effective police action.&nbsp; (While the effectiveness itself of police action does not confer legitimacy, the <i>absence</i> of likely effectiveness would argue strongly against a valid blockade.)&nbsp; The tip was hot.&nbsp; Quick police action promised success.&nbsp; As in <i>Dedman</i>, the interference with exiting motorists was “of relatively short duration and of slight inconvenience” (p. 36).</p>
