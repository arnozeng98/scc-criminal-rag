Moreau</i> and <i>R. v. Crosthwait</i> are distinguishable from the present case as they address the presumption of accuracy rather than the presumption of identity.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; "Evidence to the contrary" of the presumption in s.&nbsp;258(1)(<i>c</i>) is evidence which tends to show that there is a legally material difference between the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of testing and at the time of the offence.&nbsp; Section 258(1)(<i>c</i>) is the source of both the presumption of accuracy and the presumption of identity.&nbsp; "Evidence to the contrary" is evidence which will tend to negate either (1)&nbsp;the presumption that the breathalyzer result is an acceptably accurate indicator of the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the test; or (2)&nbsp;the presumption that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the test is acceptably representative of his blood alcohol level at the time of the offence.</span></p>

Gibson</i> (1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 28, case law establishes two distinct sets of circumstances in which it has been argued that there was "evidence to the contrary" within the meaning of s. 258(1)(<i>c</i>) and hence the presumption should not apply. First, where evidence is tendered to show that the reading was inaccurate at the time it was taken, for example cases where the evidence suggests inaccurate reading results, margin of error in the breathalyzer apparatus, or the quantity of alcohol consumed could not have produced the results recorded: see <i>R. v. Moreau</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>R. v. Crosthwait</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>R. v. Davis</i> (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 513 (B.C.C.A.). Second, where evidence is tendered to show that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was likely to have been different from what it was at the time of the test, for example cases where there is evidence that the accused consumed some alcohol after his or her arrest, or testifies as to his weight, quantity drunk, and expert evidence to suggest that the level at the time of driving would likely have been within the permissible limit.<i> </i>In the former group of cases, the Supreme Court has held that the presumption is only displaced by evidence capable of raising a doubt that the results were inaccurate to the point that the blood level of the accused at the relevant time would have been, on that evidence, below the prohibited level.</span></p>

The central issue of this appeal is the manner in which this presumption may be rebutted. Before discussing that issue directly, I think it important to review the operation of the presumptions that are employed in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> in this area and to follow with a brief review of the jurisprudence which I believe has introduced some confusion into the area.</span></p>

It is crucial, therefore, to keep in mind that presumptions are merely legal or evidentiary shortcuts designed to bridge difficult evidentiary gaps, and that they are rebuttable upon the leading of "evidence to the contrary".

When the Crown loses the benefit of the presumption, for instance because of evidence indicating that the accused consumed alcohol between the two points in time, the Crown does not lose the benefit of the presumption that the certificate accurately represents the blood alcohol level at the time of the test. The Crown may still prove, with or without recourse to expert evidence, that the blood level of the accused at the time of the offence was over 80. One of the relevant pieces of evidence will be, of course, the reading taken by the breathalyzer, the accuracy of which is not disputed.</span></p>

Hence, the presumption of identity is a temporal presumption designed to simplify the evidentiary necessity of bridging the time gap between the time of the breathalyzer and the time of the offence.&nbsp; The presumption is simply a "short-cut" for the Crown, and if the accused is able to show that the short-cut should not apply in this case, and that his or her blood alcohol level was different at the time of driving from that at the time of the test, then it would be unreasonable to apply the presumption, and on the wording of the section, the presumption would be rebutted.</span></p>

It may be possible to bridge the time gap between the test and the driving by the use of expert evidence on absorption rates of alcohol to work "backwards" in order to establish what the accused's blood alcohol level would have been at the time of driving.&nbsp; Thus, for example, if an accused blew .250 on the breathalyzer, but had consumed 100 ml of vodka one hour before the test, it would be open for an expert in this area to work backwards to give an opinion on what the accused's blood alcohol level would have been at the time of driving.&nbsp; Such an opinion would be given in terms of a range, and if the expert said that the accused would have been between .170 and .200, for instance, then a conviction would in all likelihood follow because it must be remembered that the mere fact that the presumption of identity is rebutted does not render the certificate of analysis inadmissible.&nbsp; This is still admissible evidence under s. 258(1)(<i>g</i>) for the facts contained therein and it, along with the expert's testimony and any other relevant evidence, may be easily capable of supporting a conviction.</span></p>

Essentially, the adoption of the line of reasoning advanced by the majority would place the onus on the accused to establish his or her own innocence. Specifically, if an accused were required to rebut the s. 258(1)(<i>c</i>) presumption in the manner put forward by the majority, the accused would necessarily have to <u>prove</u> that his or her blood alcohol content was less than .08.&nbsp; If this position is accepted, and the materiality of the evidence of the accused depends upon reference to the legal limit, a grey area exists between the breathalyzer result and the legal limit, and the burden of clarifying this will be placed on the accused when, in fact, the burden should rest with the Crown to prove its case.</span></p>

If the Crown cannot establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's blood alcohol level exceeded .08 this should not be sufficient to ground a conviction. If the Crown in this appeal is correct, the accused must raise a doubt as to his guilt despite the fact that the Crown may have introduced no evidence.

If <u>any</u> evidence of difference between the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the testing and at the time of the driving could be considered "evidence to the contrary" within the meaning of s. 258(1)(<i>c</i>) so as to rebut the presumption, then the presumption could be rebutted in every case.&nbsp; The simple reason for this is that an intoxicated person's blood alcohol level is constantly changing as a result of absorption and elimination of alcohol into and out of the blood.&nbsp; A person charged with "over 80" could simply show that his blood alcohol level changed between driving and being stopped because some of the alcohol had been metabolized in the interim, and suddenly the presumption in s. 258(1)(<i>c</i>) would be gone.&nbsp; In such cases, a conviction would not be difficult to obtain, because in most cases the blood alcohol level will have gone down after driving, or, if it was going up as a result of absorption, in most cases it would not have risen rapidly if nothing else was consumed.&nbsp; But, with the presumption rebutted, the Crown would, in every case, have to call expert witnesses to establish these facts and provide a range of what the accused's blood alcohol level would have been.&nbsp; If this normal process of absorption and elimination were considered to be "evidence to the contrary", then the presumption would be useless, since it could always be rebutted.</span></p>

In the words of Beetz J. in <i>Moreau</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 271 S.C.R., p. 533 C.C.C., such evidence would be aimed not at "rebutting the presumption ... but at denying its very existence".</span></p>
