Since that time period had passed before the respondent in this case was made aware of the charges against him and the certificate evidence upon which the Crown relied, and since he, therefore, was not in a position within the three-month period set by the <i>Code</i> to make an informed decision on whether to exercise his right to request production of one of his blood samples, he was effectively denied the opportunity of invoking the procedure required to obtain the mandatory release of the sample to which he was clearly entitled under s.&nbsp;258(1)(<i>d</i>).</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;566, at pp.&nbsp;568-69, 575).&nbsp; In such circumstances, no CQT may exist and notice must be given by means other than service of the CQT.</span></p>

B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, the general rule with respect to determination of vital issues in the criminal process requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Gardiner</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p.&nbsp;415.&nbsp; The issue here is very different from a question of admissibility of evidence.&nbsp; The effect of satisfying the burden of proving preliminary facts to the admissibility of evidence is only that the evidence is admitted:&nbsp; it determines neither the weight of the evidence nor the guilt of the accused.&nbsp; This occurs in the next step in the process during which the Crown must satisfy its legal burden.&nbsp; When admission of the evidence may itself have a conclusive effect with respect to guilt, the criminal standard is applied.&nbsp; This accounts for the application of this standard with respect to the admission of confessions (see <i>Ward v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R.&nbsp;30, at p.&nbsp;40, <i>per</i> Spence J., for the Court, and <i>Rothman v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;640, at pp.&nbsp;670, 674-75, <i>per</i> Martland J., for the majority, and at p.&nbsp;696, <i>per</i> Lamer J. (as he then was), concurring).&nbsp; Establishing the facts which trigger a presumption with respect to a vital issue relating to innocence or guilt is a step further advanced than the admissibility of evidence and is only reached after crossing the hurdle of admissibility.&nbsp; The effect of the presumption in this case is to provide conclusive proof of the accused's blood alcohol concentration at the critical time, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; This conclusion respecting the application of the criminal standard is supported by the view which has been taken relating to the presumption which arises by virtue of s.&nbsp;258(1)(<i>a</i>).&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Appleby</i>, [1972] S.C.R.&nbsp;303, confirmed in this regard by <i>R. v. Whyte</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R.&nbsp;3, <i>per</i> Dickson C.J., at p.&nbsp;13, it was accepted that "[t]he presumption was included to allow the Crown to prove care or control by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused occupied the driver's seat".</span></p>

Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R.&nbsp;345.&nbsp; At page 374, the majority judgment states:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

The Queen</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.&nbsp; It is the duty of the Crown to satisfy the court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the jury had been properly instructed.</span></p>

The King</i>, [1946] S.C.R.&nbsp;20, at p.&nbsp;49, and <i>Wexler v. The King</i>, [1939] S.C.R.&nbsp;350, at p. 353.</span></p>
