Araujo</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992, 2000 SCC 65; <i>Cloutier v. Langlois</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158.&nbsp; Following the adoption of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>and the articulation therein of the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, this Court established a general presumptive requirement obligating law enforcement authorities to obtain a warrant before conducting a search; see <i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145.&nbsp; Nevertheless, several exceptions to the general presumption that prior authorization is required exist; see <i>R. v. M.&nbsp;(M.R.)</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 393.<i> </i>&nbsp;Among the exceptions recognized by this Court as constitutionally valid is the long-standing common law authority to search incident to arrest without prior authorization; see <i>R. v. Beare</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, and <i>Cloutier</i>, <i>supra</i>. The particular circumstances of this case do not require a new definition of this broad common law exception, but rather require a closer examination of the prerequisites for the reasonable exercise of this power when the nature of the search, in this case a strip search, affects more directly the privacy interests of the accused.&nbsp; The privacy interest is upheld not by removing or limiting the actual authority to search, but rather by ensuring the reasonableness of the search.</p>

The courts have long acknowledged that the effectiveness and the legitimacy of the law enforcement system depends on the ability of police to find and preserve relevant evidence which may assist in the investigation and prosecution of the accused: see <i>Cloutier</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R. v. Lim (No. 2)</i> (1990), 1 C.R.R. (2d) 136 (Ont. H.C.J.); <i>Beare</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; My colleagues would severely limit the availability of this justification for strip searches by requiring police officers to conduct all strip searches at the police station. I do not agree that the discovery of evidence should be postponed to a time where the search can take place at a police station.&nbsp; The common law requirements that the evidence sought be related to the reason for the arrest and that the search be conducted in a manner that is not abusive apply to protect accused persons from indiscriminate or unreasonable searches regardless of whether the search occurs at the station or in the field.&nbsp;</p>

The common law rules must have regard to the realities of the situation. Police officers are not always close to a station.&nbsp; They operate in remote areas and are often alone.&nbsp; In my view, the argument that the risk of the detainee getting rid of the evidence is minimal is as unrealistic as the belief that an accused can never escape during his transfer to the police station or that a detainee can never escape from a prison. Also unrealistic is the assumption that evidence dropped or left behind by an accused could ‚Äúeasily‚Äù be linked circumstantially back to the accused.&nbsp;</p>

Although foreign legislation can be useful as a source of criteria to determine the reasonableness of a search, I think it is clearly excessive to adopt foreign legislation to reinvent the common law rule in Canada.&nbsp; This is particularly inopportune given that the foreign legislation referred to by my colleagues was specifically adopted to supersede the common law.&nbsp; In my view, the proposed rule that all strip searches proceed at a police station absent exigent circumstances should be left to Parliament.</p>

There is no demonstrated need for such a radical change to the common law power.&nbsp; My colleagues come to the conclusion that the trial judge erred in determining that the search was reasonable in all of the circumstances principally on the basis that there were no exigent circumstances to justify a search outside the police station.&nbsp; I disagree with their conclusion on the basis that the police are under no obligation to defer the search.</p>

A. Cohen, ‚ÄúSearch Incident to Arrest‚Äù (1989-90), 32 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 366.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
13.6pt;line-height:24.4pt">The nature of activity, the small quantity apparently involved, the manner in which it was handled, the colour of the substance, the locale in which it occurred, all of these would provide an objective basis on which the officer could found a belief, which he did form, on those reasonable and probable grounds that trafficking had occurred.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Moreover, the arrest took place immediately after the second transaction, and was based on information and descriptions provided by Constable Theriault, who was stationed at the observation post and had witnessed the transactions through a telescope.&nbsp; Thus, not only did this officer have reasonable and probable grounds for believing the appellant committed an offence, but so did Constable Ryan, the arresting officer on the ‚Äútake-down‚Äù team.</p>

Finding that the search was reasonable and did not violate the appellant‚Äôs right to privacy, McNeely J. held that the evidence obtained from the search would be admissible at trial.&nbsp; He thus concluded his reasons for judgment as follows at para. 26:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

In <i>Naylor</i>, the trial judge directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on the basis that the police officers did not have the right to search the plaintiff and remove her jewellery and that the defendant was therefore entitled to resist in the way that she did.</p>

Robinson</i>, 414 U.S. 218 (1973), the police arrested the accused for operating a vehicle after his operator‚Äôs permit had been revoked.&nbsp; They conducted a ‚Äúpat-down‚Äù search of the accused‚Äôs clothing and pockets and found a quantity of heroin on his person.&nbsp; The majority held that this search did not contravene the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.&nbsp; In determining whether the police had the power to conduct such a search, the majority reviewed the U.S. precedents, and concluded that they had recognized a power to search a lawfully arrested person as an incident to arrest. Such power was found to be well-rooted in the American legal tradition, and served the practical function of removing weapons from an arrestee and preventing the destruction of evidence in his or her possession. In reaching its conclusion, the majority (<i>per</i> Rehnquist J., as he then was) stated the following (at p. 235):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The authority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.&nbsp; A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.&nbsp; It is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search, and we hold that in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô search under that Amendment.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The reasoning in <i>Robinson</i> was reiterated by the Supreme Court in <i>Gustafson v.

Ackerman</i>, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984).&nbsp; On the other hand, legislation authorizing warrantless strip searches has been held to be constitutional provided that the search was based on ‚Äúindividualized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband‚Äù: <i>&nbsp;State v. Audley</i>, 894 P.2d 1359 (Wash. Ct. App. 1995), at p. 1365.&nbsp; In <i>Swain v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The restricted availability of powers of personal search in this context [the criminal law context], however, is due less to a heightened respect for personal integrity on the part of Anglo-Canadian lawmakers than to the historical association of the warrant with searches of private dwellings.&nbsp; Indeed, the development over the last three centuries of the warrant, with its safeguards against unjustified entry into private domains, has been accompanied by the accrual of relatively discretionary warrantless powers to search persons.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Thus, searches of the person incident to arrest fall to be governed by the common law.</p>

(4th) 53, the accused was observed for several hours at a house where police suspected drug trafficking took place.&nbsp; The police later stopped the accused‚Äôs vehicle, searched his vehicle and checked his name on CPIC.&nbsp; They then noticed a bulge in the accused‚Äôs pants, and discovered, after undoing his pants, that he was concealing a bag containing cocaine.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal ruled that the search violated s. 8 because it was conducted on the basis of mere suspicion, rather than reasonable and probable grounds.&nbsp; Although the violation of s. 8 was found primarily on the basis that there was a lack of reasonable and probable grounds, the court also noted the intrusive method of the search.&nbsp; The court held that the s. 8 violation was serious and that the evidence should therefore be excluded under s. 24(2) and an acquittal entered.&nbsp;</p>

Miller</i>, [1993] B.C.J.

Lyons, Toronto Police Services Board Review,&nbsp; <i>Search of Persons Policy</i> -- <i>The Search of Persons</i> -- <i>A Position Paper</i> (April 12, 1999)).&nbsp; Some commentators have gone as far as to describe strip searches as ‚Äúvisual rape‚Äù (P. R. Shuldiner, ‚ÄúVisual Rape:&nbsp; A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip Searches‚Äù (1979), 13 <i>J. Marshall L.

At the <i>voir dire</i> hearing, McNeely J. held that had the appellant ‚Äúrelaxed and not attempted to retain the substance‚Äù, the search would have been shorter and less intrusive.&nbsp; The respondent endorsed McNeely J.‚Äôs reasoning, relying on the British Columbia Court of Appeal‚Äôs decision in <i>R. v. Garcia-Guiterrez</i> (1991), 5 C.R. (4th) 1. In that case, police observed the accused reach into his mouth, remove something and give it to another person, who gave the accused money in return. After arresting the accused for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, an officer grabbed his throat to prevent him from swallowing and breathing, and instructed him to open his mouth.&nbsp; The accused refused and a second officer punched him in the stomach.&nbsp; A majority of the Court of Appeal held that the search was reasonable, as it was found necessary to preserve the evidence. In this regard, Macdonald J.A. held (at para. 17) that the accused was ‚Äúin complete control‚Äù of the violence inflicted upon him, since, had he simply opened his mouth, the police would have ceased applying physical force.</p>
