The Alberta Court of Appeal set aside the stay entered by the trial judge and ordered a new trial. The appeal to this Court was dismissed at the conclusion of oral arguments with reasons to follow. I find that when the prosecution has lost evidence that should have been disclosed, the Crown has a duty to explain what happened to it.&nbsp; So long as the explanation is satisfactory, it discharges the Crown’s constitutional obligation to disclose.&nbsp; There will, however, be a breach of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> if the explanation does not satisfy the trial judge.&nbsp; Moreover, I would not rule out a remedy in the extraordinary case in which a satisfactory explanation is given for the loss of evidence and no abuse of process is found, but the evidence is so important that its loss renders a fair trial problematic.</span></p>

During this time she spoke to the police officers, as well as others, including her mother.&nbsp; Const.

Witness statements raised a special problem in that case. We found that police notes should be disclosed if they exist, and if they do not, a “will say” statement based on the information in the Crown’s possession and summarizing the anticipated evidence of the witness should be disclosed; see p. 344.</span></p>

During the interview, the witness had expressed doubts about the accuracy of her earlier testimony. The officer who interviewed her had died of a brain tumour. However, the Crown disclosed a transcript of the interview. In setting aside the stay of proceedings entered by the trial judge, the Alberta Court of Appeal noted that it is information contained in witness statements that must be disclosed, not the original statement:<i> Stinchcombe (No. 2)</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; This Court agreed, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 754, at para. 2:</span></p>

The right of disclosure would be a hollow one if the Crown were not required to preserve evidence that is known to be relevant.&nbsp; Yet despite the best efforts of the Crown to preserve evidence, owing to the frailties of human nature, evidence will occasionally be lost.&nbsp; The principle in <i>Stinchcombe (No. 2)</i>, <i>supra</i>, recognizes this unfortunate fact.&nbsp; Where the Crown’s explanation satisfies the trial judge that the evidence has not been destroyed or lost owing to unacceptable negligence, the duty to disclose has not been breached.&nbsp; Where the Crown is unable to satisfy the judge in this regard, it has failed to meet its disclosure obligations, and there has accordingly been a breach of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Such a failure may also suggest that an abuse of process has occurred, but that is a separate question.&nbsp; It is not necessary that an accused establish abuse of process for the Crown to have failed to meet its s. 7 obligation to disclose.</span></p>

The main consideration is whether the Crown or the police (as the case may be) took reasonable steps in the circumstances to preserve the evidence for disclosure. One circumstance that must be considered is the relevance that the evidence was perceived to have at the time. The police cannot be expected to preserve everything that comes into their hands on the off-chance that it will be relevant in the future. In addition, even the loss of relevant evidence will not result in a breach of the duty to disclose if the conduct of the police is reasonable.&nbsp; But as the relevance of the evidence increases, so does the degree of care for its preservation that is expected of the police.</span></p>

This is often best assessed in the context of the trial as it unfolds. Accordingly, the trial judge has a discretion as to whether to rule on the application for a stay immediately or after hearing some or all of the evidence.&nbsp; Unless it is clear that no other course of action will cure the prejudice that is occasioned by the conduct giving rise to the abuse, it will usually be preferable to reserve on the application.&nbsp; This will enable the judge to assess the degree of prejudice and as well to determine whether measures to minimize the prejudice have borne fruit. This is the procedure adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the context of lost evidence cases. In <i>R. v. B. (D.J.)</i> (1993), 16 C.R.R. (2d) 381, the court said at p. 382:</span></p>

In my view, it was. Although the record is scanty, there is no suggestion that Const. Hollinger was negligent in his handling of the tape recording of the interview with M.F. The conversation was not tape-recorded for the purposes of a criminal investigation, but for the secure treatment application.&nbsp; He did not consider it to be a detailed conversation. Const. Hollinger made the tape before the investigation of the activities of the accused began and did not turn it over to the police officer who investigated the charges in issue. Nor was he involved in that investigation. It appears from the record that Const. Hollinger listened to the tape in preparation for his testimony at the secure treatment application hearing. It follows that he took care to preserve the tape, at least until the hearing. The manner of the tape’s subsequent disappearance remains unknown: Const. Hollinger explained that he did not know what had happened to the tape, but that he had searched for it and had been unable to find it. He also testified that he was involved in a fairly stressful and traumatic incident shortly after making the tape, namely, his shooting at a car and the investigation that followed. These factors lead me to the conclusion that Const. Hollinger did not fail to take reasonable steps in the circumstances to preserve the tape.</span></p>

It does not. The trial judge rejected entirely the defence’s contention that the conduct of the Crown amounted to an abuse of process, and was not satisfied that any improper motive could be attributed to the Crown or the police. Although the trial judge did not specifically address the issue of negligence, I am satisfied that the tape was lost in circumstances that did not amount to an abuse of process.</span></p>

Hollinger’s testimony at the Family Court proceeding that M.F. told “a few lies” during this interview. As well, the appellant claims, prejudice arises because there are inconsistencies between M.F.’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry and that of other witnesses, and the missing statement was made prior to her later written statement, which was made after she had the opportunity to collaborate with other witnesses.</span></p>

The interview recorded on the tape was not regarded by Const. Hollinger to be a detailed conversation, and he was investigating a runaway teen, not a prostitution ring.&nbsp; M.F. provided four other statements to the police. She testified at the preliminary inquiry.&nbsp; Most importantly, an alternative source of information is available: Const. Hollinger has already testified that M.F. told “a few lies”. That in itself is highly useful to the defence in attacking her credibility.&nbsp; Const. Hollinger was cross-examined during a <i>voir dire</i> at the trial.&nbsp; He was not asked, however, to elaborate on the lies that M.F. told nor whether there were discrepancies between what was said by M.F. on the tape and the statements which were taken subsequently.&nbsp; Until that evidence is heard it is at least premature to allege that the appellant’s rights to full answer and defence are seriously prejudiced.&nbsp; Moreover, adopting an optimistic view as to what the tape would have disclosed, it is difficult for me to accept that even a successful cross-examination would be appreciably more damaging to the credibility of M.F. than the evidence of Const. Hollinger that she told a few lies.</span></p>

Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326 (“<i>Stinchcombe (No. 1)</i>”), <i>per</i> Sopinka J., at p. 336.&nbsp; To establish the very <u>process</u> of disclosure as a distinct constitutional right would be, in my view, a substantial departure from the jurisprudence in this area and would needlessly complicate this area of law.</p>

Young, <i>Adversarial Justice and the Charter of Rights: Stunting the Growth of the “Living Tree” </i>(1997), 39 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 406, at p. 419, that “<i>Stinchcombe</i> did not create a new right with respect to disclosure as the common law has always considered full disclosure to be an integral part of the process”.&nbsp; See also <i>R. v.

Cook</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1113<span lang="EN-GB">.</span>&nbsp; There are a number of other practical advantages to full disclosure, not the least of which is the encouragement of early resolution of criminal charges: <i>Stinchcombe (No. 1)</i>, at p. 334.&nbsp; See also the <i>Report of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure, and Resolution Discussions</i> (1993), under the Chair of G. Arthur Martin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, for constitutional purposes, it is crucial to recall that disclosure is no more than a process, albeit an important one, which exists to further the rights of an accused as set out above.&nbsp;</p>

Burlingham</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, at p. 286, where, although I agreed with the majority that the Crown's conduct in disregarding the plea bargain made with the accused did not amount to one of the "clearest of cases" requiring a stay of proceedings, I would have nonetheless found a violation of the accused's rights under s. 7 and substituted a conviction for the lesser included offence which was the object of the plea bargain.</span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp; As Graeme G.&nbsp; Mitchell favourably noted, the decision of this Court in <i>O’Connor</i>,<i> supra</i>, “signals a radical change in the concept of what constitutes an abuse of process”:&nbsp;&nbsp; “Abuse of Process and the Crown’s Disclosure Obligation” (1996), 44 C.R. (4th) 130, at p. 136; see also Lee Stuesser, “Abuse of Process: The Need to Reconsider” (1994), 29 C.R. (4th) 92, at p. 103; Ursula Hendel and Peter Sankoff, “R. v. Edwards: When Two Wrongs Might Just Make&nbsp; a Right” (1996), 45 C.R. (4th) 330, at p. 334.&nbsp; It cannot be said, therefore, that a violation of s. 7 based on an abuse of process will be impossible for an accused to establish in an appropriate case.</span></p>
