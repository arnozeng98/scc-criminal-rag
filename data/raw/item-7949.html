Law Society of Alberta</i>, 2002 SCC 65, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372.&nbsp; Subject to the abuse of process doctrine, supervising one litigant’s decision-making process — rather than the conduct of litigants before the court — is beyond the legitimate reach of the court.&nbsp; The Crown’s decision in this case to resile from the plea agreement and to continue the prosecution clearly constituted an act of prosecutorial discretion subject to the principles set out in <i>Krieger</i>:&nbsp; it is only reviewable for abuse of process.&nbsp; Prosecutorial discretion is not spent with the decision to initiate the proceedings, nor does it terminate with a plea agreement.&nbsp; So long as the proceedings are ongoing, the Crown may be required to make further decisions about whether the prosecution should be continued, and if so, in respect of what charges. </span></p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The repudiation of a plea agreement may well constitute an abuse of process, either because it results in trial unfairness or meets the narrow residual category of abuse that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.&nbsp; The more difficult question in this appeal is how the initial exercise of prosecutorial discretion — Crown counsel’s offer to resolve the matter on the basis of a plea to a lesser charge — should figure in the analysis regarding abuse of process.&nbsp; A plea agreement should not be regarded as a contractual undertaking.&nbsp; Vitiating factors, such as mistake, misrepresentation or fraud, which usually inform a private party’s right to resile from a bargain, do not fully capture the public interest considerations which are at play.&nbsp; However, the analogy can usefully underscore the utmost importance of honouring the agreement.&nbsp; The situations in which the Crown can properly repudiate a plea agreement are, and must remain, very rare.&nbsp; Moreover, the reasonably defensible test applied by the application judge to Crown counsel’s decision to enter into a plea agreement is not the appropriate measure to determine whether there is an abuse of process.&nbsp; Indeed, it is the circumstances surrounding the repudiation of a plea agreement which should be reviewed to determine whether that decision amounts to an abuse of process.&nbsp; Reviewing for “reasonableness” a decision made in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion runs contrary to the constitutionally separate role of the Attorney General in the initiation and pursuit of criminal prosecutions as well as the principles set out in <i>Krieger</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that acts of prosecutorial discretion are generally beyond the reach of the court, there is good reason to impose a threshold burden on the applicant who alleges abuse of process.&nbsp; A court should not embark on an inquiry into the reasons behind the exercise of prosecutorial discretion without a proper evidentiary foundation.&nbsp; However, evidence that a plea agreement has been entered into and subsequently reneged by the Crown meets the requisite threshold.&nbsp; Further, to the extent that the Crown is the only party who is privy to the information, the evidentiary burden shifts to the Crown to enlighten the court on the circumstances and reasons behind its decision to resile from the agreement.&nbsp; The ultimate burden of proving abuse of process, however, remains on the applicant.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the Crown’s repudiation conduct cannot be considered so unfair or oppressive to the accused, or so tainted by bad faith or improper motive, that to allow the Crown to now proceed on the dangerous driving <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> charges would tarnish the integrity of the judicial system and thus constitute an abuse of process.&nbsp; Indeed, the Acting Assistant Deputy Minister, in good faith, determined that Crown counsel’s assessment of the strength of the evidence was erroneous and, on that basis, having regard to the seriousness of the offences, concluded that it would not be in the public interest to terminate the prosecution on the criminal charges.&nbsp; This can hardly be regarded as evidence of misconduct.&nbsp; Finally, the accused was returned to the position she was in at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing before the plea agreement was entered into and thus suffered no prejudice as a result of the repudiation. </span></p>

Ct. J. of the Provincial Court of Alberta embarked on an inquiry into the matter, at the conclusion of which he reserved judgment.&nbsp; At the outset of his written reasons, the application judge noted that the Attorney General has the ultimate power to initiate, conduct and terminate prosecutions, as affirmed by this Court in <i>Krieger v. Law Society of Alberta</i>, 2002 SCC 65, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372.&nbsp; He also acknowledged that the courts will rarely interfere with the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.&nbsp; In his view, however, “when that discretion is exercised in favour of proceeding, the matter becomes subject to the processes and procedures sanctioned by the court” (para. 12).&nbsp; Thus, he held that negotiations between counsel after charges are laid were matters of tactics or conduct which were subject to review by the court.</span></p>

In his view, Ms. Nixon was prejudiced because defence counsel was led to believe that the evidence of breath samples would not be adduced at trial and, consequently, did not explore that issue at the preliminary hearing.</span></p>

The Court explained that the principle of independence requires that the Attorney General “act independently of partisan concerns when supervising prosecutorial decisions” and how it “finds further form in the principle that courts will not interfere with his exercise of executive authority, as reflected in the prosecutorial decision‑making process” (paras. 30 and 31).&nbsp; The Court stressed the fundamental importance of the principle of independence in these terms (at para 32):</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">The court’s acknowledgment of the Attorney General’s independence from judicial review in the sphere of prosecutorial discretion has its strongest source in the fundamental principle of the rule of law under our Constitution.&nbsp; <u>Subject to the abuse of process doctrine, supervising one litigant’s decision-making process — rather than the conduct of litigants before the court — is beyond the legitimate reach of the court.</u>&nbsp; . . . The quasi-judicial function of the Attorney General cannot be subjected to interference from parties who are not as competent to consider the various factors involved in making a decision to prosecute.&nbsp; To subject such decisions to political interference, <u>or to judicial supervision</u>, could erode the integrity of our system of prosecution.&nbsp; Clearly drawn constitutional lines are necessary in areas subject to such grave potential conflict.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">“Prosecutorial discretion” is a term of art.&nbsp; It does not simply refer to any discretionary decision made by a Crown prosecutor.&nbsp; Prosecutorial discretion refers to the use of those powers that constitute the core of the Attorney General’s office and which are protected from the influence of improper political and other vitiating factors by the principle of independence.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Without being exhaustive, we believe the core elements of prosecutorial discretion encompass the following:&nbsp; (a) the discretion whether to bring the prosecution of a charge laid by police; (b) the discretion to enter a stay of proceedings in either a private or public prosecution, as codified in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec579" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec579" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Osborne</i> (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 405 (N.B.C.A.); and (e) the discretion to take control of a private prosecution:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Osiowy</i> (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 189 (Sask.

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Significantly, what is common to the various elements of prosecutorial discretion is that they involve the ultimate decisions as to <u>whether</u> a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased, and <u>what</u> the prosecution ought to be for.&nbsp; Put differently, prosecutorial discretion refers to decisions regarding the nature and extent of the prosecution and the Attorney General’s participation in it.&nbsp; Decisions that do not go to the nature and extent of the prosecution, i.e., the decisions that govern a Crown prosecutor’s tactics or conduct before the court, do not fall within the scope of prosecutorial discretion.&nbsp; Rather, such decisions are governed by the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control its own processes once the Attorney General has elected to enter into that forum.&nbsp; [First emphasis added; second and third emphases in original; paras. 43 and 46-47.]</span></p>

She contends that the Crown’s decision to resile from the agreement constitutes a reversal in tactic subject to broader review.&nbsp; Given that Crown counsel’s offer had been accepted by the defence, the resulting plea agreement is akin to a contractual undertaking.&nbsp; A bargain is a bargain, it is argued.&nbsp; Absent some vitiating flaw in the negotiating process, such as mistake, misrepresentation or fraud, the Crown should be held strictly to its word.&nbsp; It is not necessary for the applicant to show that she has been prejudiced, or to establish independent acts of “bad faith” or “flagrant impropriety”.&nbsp; Unless the Crown can satisfy the court that implementing the plea agreement would itself bring the administration of justice into disrepute, the repudiation of a valid plea agreement, in and of itself, constitutes an abuse of process.&nbsp; In short, Ms. Nixon argues that the application judge adopted the correct approach and urges the Court to restore his decision.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The intervener Criminal Trial Lawyers’ Association (“CTLA”) supports Ms. Nixon’s argument that the Crown’s promise to enter into a plea agreement is an undertaking “like any other given by a lawyer”.&nbsp; It argues that the undertaking “must be strictly and scrupulously fulfilled” and that an abuse of process need not be shown before the agreement may be summarily enforced by a court (Factum of the CTLA, at para. 2).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario) (“CLA”) also supports Ms.&nbsp;Nixon’s position that the repudiation of a plea agreement does not fall within “core” Crown discretion identified in <i>Krieger</i>.&nbsp; Thus, the CLA submits that judicial review of a repudiation decision is warranted even in the absence of “flagrant impropriety” or bad faith.&nbsp; Rather, the test for allowing Crown repudiation of a plea agreement should be essentially the same as the test applied for allowing a sentencing judge to reject a joint submission:&nbsp; would the proposed resolution bring the administration of justice into disrepute?&nbsp; The CLA submits that “[r]epudiation is an abuse of process <u>unless</u> the Crown discharges its onus of demonstrating that the contemplated agreement would have brought the administration of justice into disrepute and the accused can be restored to his or her initial position” (Factum of the CLA, at para. 1 (emphasis in original)).</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Attorneys General from three provinces intervened in support of the respondent’s position.&nbsp; In particular, they submit that the approach adopted by the application judge runs afoul with the principle of independence affirmed in <i>Krieger</i>.<i> </i>The Attorney General of Ontario submits that this Court’s decision in <i>Krieger</i> has been misinterpreted by lower courts.&nbsp; It asks this Court to confirm that <i>Krieger</i> was never intended to narrow the area of protected prosecutorial discretion, or to create a schism in threshold tests for finding an abuse of process depending on whether a decision is considered “core” or “non-core”.&nbsp; All acts of prosecutorial discretion are immune from judicial supervision, subject only to the same high threshold for abuse of process.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Along the same lines, the Attorney General of British Columbia (“AGBC”) emphasizes the importance of criminal trial courts not proceeding with a review of prosecutorial discretion in the absence of a “threshold determination” that the inquiry is warranted.&nbsp; In the absence of evidence of irremediable impairment to the fair trial interests of the accused, a criminal trial court should only proceed with an application for relief challenging prosecutorial discretion under the residual category of abuse of process if there is an evidentiary record capable of supporting the claim.&nbsp; This approach helps to avoid scenarios such as the case at bar, where the trial judge engaged in a full examination of the reasons behind the decision to renege on the plea agreement, even though there was nothing to suggest that the decision was motivated by improper considerations, or was made in bad faith.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, the Attorney General of Manitoba (“AGM”) intervenes to underscore the importance of the Attorney General’s supervisory role over the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.&nbsp; Acknowledging that the repudiation of plea agreements is and should be rare, it argues that “when the Attorney General, or a senior delegate, makes a <i>bona fide </i>decision to overturn a plea agreement that he or she determines is contrary to the public interest, that decision is part of the proper and usual institutional checks and balances necessary for the justice system to function properly” (Factum of the AGM, at para. 3).</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">None of the participants in this appeal disputes that Crown counsel’s decision to resolve the proceedings by accepting a plea to a lesser offence falls within the scope of prosecutorial discretion as defined in <i>Krieger</i>.&nbsp; To the extent that the application judge’s analysis suggests that anything occurring after the charges are laid falls outside the scope of prosecutorial discretion, it cannot be sustained.&nbsp; If the line were to be drawn at the point seemingly chosen by the application judge, namely “when [the] discretion is exercised in favour of proceeding” (para. 12), Crown counsel’s decision to enter into a plea agreement would itself be subject to review by the court as a matter of conduct or tactic without regard to the principles of judicial restraint set out in <i>Krieger</i>.&nbsp; As noted by Paperny J.A., to artificially draw the line at the courtroom door “effectively neuters some of the primary purposes of prosecutorial discretion, to resolve cases by accepting pleas to lesser charges and to discontinue prosecutions” (para. 32).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the question of whether the ADM’s decision to repudiate the plea agreement is an act of prosecutorial discretion, although disputed in this appeal, is just as easily resolved.&nbsp; As aptly put by Paperny J.A., in determining whether any impugned decision falls within the core of prosecutorial discretion, it is useful to ask: “. . . is it a decision as to whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased, and if so, what it should be for?” (para. 32).&nbsp; Applying this test, she held that the ADM’s decision to repudiate the plea agreement “fell squarely within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion” (para. 33).&nbsp; I agree. In my respectful view, it is difficult to see how the ADM’s decision could otherwise be characterized.&nbsp; The ADM effectively decided that the prosecution against Ms. Nixon should be<i> </i>continued<i> </i>and that it should be for the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>offences of dangerous driving, not for the traffic infraction of careless driving.&nbsp; Clearly, the ADM’s decision to repudiate the plea agreement also constitutes an act of prosecutorial discretion.&nbsp; Prosecutorial discretion was not spent with the decision to initiate the proceedings, nor did it terminate with the plea agreement.&nbsp; So long as the proceedings are ongoing, the Crown may be required to make further decisions about whether the prosecution should be continued and, if so, in respect of what charges.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Thus, it follows that the Crown’s ultimate decision to resile from the plea agreement and to continue the prosecution is subject to the principles set out in <i>Krieger</i>:&nbsp; it is <i>only </i>subject to judicial review for abuse of process.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The more difficult question in this appeal is how the initial exercise of prosecutorial discretion — Crown counsel’s offer to resolve the matter on the basis of a plea to a lesser charge — should figure in the analysis regarding abuse of process.&nbsp; As outlined earlier, the parties and interveners present very divergent views on how this question should be answered.&nbsp; Before dealing with these arguments, I will review the law on abuse of process.</span></p>

Jewitt</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, there was much controversy about whether a court had the power to stay validly instituted criminal proceedings for abuse of process.&nbsp; The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to control its own process by staying abusive proceedings had long been recognized in Canada.&nbsp; However, it remained uncertain whether criminal courts had the discretion to stay proceedings for abuse of process, or whether this was a power reserved for the Attorney General under s. 508 (now s. 579) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> (pp. 131-32).</span></p>

O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, the Court noted that there was much overlap between the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and the common law doctrine of abuse of process, as the latter had found application in circumstances involving state conduct touching upon both “the integrity of the judicial system and the fairness of the individual accused’s trial” (para. 73).&nbsp; Consequently, L’Heureux-Dubé J., writing for a unanimous Court on this point, held that the two regimes should be merged under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Depending on the circumstances, different <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>guarantees may be engaged by the alleged abuse of process and thus some claims may be better addressed by reference to the specific procedural guarantee.&nbsp; For example, “where the accused claims that the Crown’s conduct has prejudiced his ability to have a trial within a reasonable time, abuses may be best addressed by reference to s. 11(<i>b</i>)” (para. 73).&nbsp; The Court identified two categories of abuse of process which would be caught by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>:&nbsp; (1) prosecutorial conduct affecting the fairness of the trial; and (2) prosecutorial conduct that “contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process” (para. 73).</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Remedies less drastic than a stay of proceedings are of course available under s. 24(1) in situations where the “clearest of cases” threshold is not met but where it is proved, on a balance of probabilities, that s. 7 has been violated.

 <p class="Citation-AltC"><span lang="EN-CA">To define “oppressive” as requiring misconduct or an improper motive would, in my view, unduly restrict the operation of the doctrine.&nbsp; In this case, for example, where there is no suggestion of misconduct, such a definition would prevent any limit being placed on the number of trials that could take place.&nbsp; Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation are but two of many factors to be taken into account when a court is called upon to consider whether or not in a particular case the Crown’s exercise of its discretion to re-lay the indictment amounts to an abuse of process.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Under the doctrine of abuse of process, the unfair or oppressive treatment of an appellant disentitles the Crown to carry on with the prosecution of the charge.&nbsp; <u>The prosecution is set aside</u>, not on the merits (see <i>Jewitt</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 148), but <u>because it is tainted to such a degree that to allow it to proceed would tarnish the integrity of the court</u>.&nbsp; The doctrine is one of the safeguards designed to ensure “that the repression of crime through the conviction of the guilty is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values as a society” (<i>Rothman v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 689, <i>per</i> Lamer J.)&nbsp; It acknowledges that courts must have the respect and support of the community in order that the administration of criminal justice may properly fulfil its function. Consequently, <u>where the affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest in the effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of justice is best served by staying the proceedings</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 1667.]</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">A plea agreement cannot be summarily enforced by the court as any other lawyers’ undertaking, as Ms. Nixon contends.&nbsp; It is also wrong to suggest that repudiation, in and of itself, warrants a judicial remedy even in the absence of prejudice (as the application judge concluded, at para. 55), or in the absence of conduct amounting to an abuse of process.&nbsp; This argument is founded on the erroneous premise that the decision to repudiate a plea agreement falls outside the scope of prosecutorial discretion and, as such, is not subject to the constitutional principles set out in <i>Krieger</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[46]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">However, to the extent that the lawyers’ undertaking analogy underscores the importance of honouring plea agreements, it can usefully contribute to the analysis.&nbsp; Indeed, in the oft-quoted Ontario <i>Report of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure, and Resolution Discussions </i>(1993)<i> </i>(the “<i>Martin Committee Report</i>”), the Committee found resolution agreements in criminal proceedings to be “in the nature of undertakings”.&nbsp; The duty of counsel to honour resolution agreements was regarded as “a particular example of the duties of integrity and responsibility” that lie “at the heart of counsel’s professional obligations”.&nbsp; Honouring resolution agreements was not only “ethically imperative”, but also a “practical necessity”, as these agreements “dispose of the great bulk of the contentious issues that come before the criminal courts in Ontario” (commentary to Recommendation 53, at pp. 312-13 of the <i>Martin Committee Report</i>).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In light of this practical necessity, the <i>binding effect</i> of plea agreements is a matter of utmost importance to the administration of justice.&nbsp; It goes without saying that plea resolutions help to resolve the vast majority of criminal cases in Canada and, in doing so, contribute to a fair and efficient criminal justice system.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Of course, there may be instances where different Crown counsel will invariably disagree about the appropriate plea agreement in a particular case.&nbsp; Given the number of complex factors that must be weighed over the course of plea resolution discussions, this reality is unsurprising.&nbsp; However, the vital importance of upholding such agreements means that, in those instances where there is disagreement, the Crown may simply have to live with the initial decision that has been made.&nbsp; To hold otherwise would mean that defence lawyers would no longer have confidence in the finality of negotiated agreements reached with front-line Crown counsel, with whom they work on a daily basis.&nbsp; Further, if agreements arrived at over the course of resolution discussions cannot be relied upon by the accused, the benefits that resolutions produce for <i>both</i> the accused and the administration of justice cannot be achieved. &nbsp;As a result, I reiterate that the situations in which the Crown&nbsp; can properly repudiate a resolution agreement are, and must remain, very rare.</span></p>

However, the lawyers’ undertaking analogy can only go so far on the question that occupies us.&nbsp; The analogy can usefully underscore the importance of honouring plea agreements, but it cannot inform the standard against which any repudiation conduct is to be measured.&nbsp; The<i> Martin Committee Report </i>made this clear in the same commentary quoted above, stating the following:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Thus, it is plain that resolution agreements must not undermine the integrity of the court, or otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute.&nbsp; While the sanctity of agreements entered into is an important principle of the administration of justice, Crown counsel’s primary duty is to the integrity of the system.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the rare cases where these two values clash, the latter must prevail.&nbsp; [p. 314]</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">As a result, the argument that a plea agreement can simply be characterized as a contractual undertaking must fail.</span></p>

As she noted, the application judge’s mistaken approach not only had the effect of reversing the onus of proof, his “selected framework for analysis caused him to ask the wrong question”.&nbsp; Instead of reviewing&nbsp; Crown counsel’s decision to enter into the plea agreement to see if it was defensible, he should have reviewed the circumstances surrounding the repudiation to determine whether <i>that</i> decision amounted to an abuse of process (para. 45).</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Quite apart from this fundamental difficulty with the reasonably defensible test, I would add that, conceptually, the analogy to the trial judge’s rejection of a joint submission on sentencing is not particularly helpful in determining the standard against which to measure the repudiation conduct.&nbsp; The sentencing judge who is faced with a joint submission is engaged in a qualitatively different process than the prosecutorial authority faced with the decision of whether or not to resile from a plea agreement.&nbsp; The role of the sentencing judge is to impose a fit sentence, that is, one that “fits” the circumstances of the offence and of the offender as presented to the court.&nbsp; When there is a trial, these circumstances are largely defined by the findings of the court based on the evidence adduced at trial and at the sentence hearing.&nbsp; When the accused pleads guilty, the circumstances of the offence and of the offender are generally determined on the basis of agreed facts.&nbsp; This is particularly so if the plea of guilty is entered pursuant to a resolution agreement.&nbsp; All contentious issues will usually have been ironed out between the Crown and the defence prior to the plea.&nbsp; Counsel certainly have an ethical obligation not to mislead the court about those circumstances, but the fact remains that the judge is presented with the <i>end product</i> of the plea negotiations, not with the entire set of circumstances or considerations that went into the mix.&nbsp; By contrast, the prosecuting authority who is faced with the decision whether to honour or to resile from a plea agreement must consider the entirety of circumstances, including the public interest, in proceeding to trial.&nbsp; Thus, sentencing principles relating to joint submissions cannot usefully be transposed in this context.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">First, she describes in an affidavit the emotional and psychological trauma she suffered following the incident and laying of the criminal charges, and then explains how she suffered increased anxiety as a result of the Crown’s change of position.&nbsp; There is no reason to doubt that Ms. Nixon was affected by the course of events as she describes in her affidavit.&nbsp; However, this has no bearing on the fairness of her trial.</span></p>

However, it is my view that evidence that a plea agreement has been entered into and subsequently reneged by the Crown meets the requisite threshold. &nbsp;I will explain.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">As the AGBC rightly points out, mandating a preliminary determination on the utility of a <i>Charter</i>-based inquiry is not new:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Pires</i>, 2005 SCC 66, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 343.&nbsp; Similar thresholds are also imposed in other areas of the criminal law, they are not an anomaly.&nbsp; Threshold requirements may be imposed for pragmatic reasons alone.&nbsp; As this Court observed in <i>Pires</i> (at para. 35):</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC"><span lang="EN-CA">For our justice system to operate, trial judges must have some ability to control the course of proceedings before them.&nbsp; One such mechanism is the power to decline to embark upon an evidentiary hearing at the request of one of the parties when that party is unable to show a reasonable likelihood that the hearing can assist in determining the issues before the court.</span></p>

Without more, there would be no basis for the court to look behind the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">However, the repudiation of a plea agreement is not just a bare allegation. It is evidence that the Crown has gone back on its word.&nbsp; As everyone agrees, it is of crucial importance to the proper and fair administration of criminal justice that plea&nbsp; agreements be honoured.&nbsp; The repudiation of a plea agreement is a rare and exceptional event.&nbsp; In my view, evidence that a plea agreement was entered into with the Crown, and subsequently reneged by the Crown, provides the requisite evidentiary threshold to embark on a review of the decision for abuse of process. Further, to the extent that the Crown is the only party who is privy to the information, the evidentiary burden shifts to the Crown to enlighten the court on the circumstances and reasons behind its decision to resile from the agreement.&nbsp; That is, the Crown must explain why and how it made the decision not to honour the plea agreement.&nbsp; The ultimate burden of proving abuse of process remains on the applicant and, as discussed earlier, the test is a stringent one.&nbsp; However, if the Crown provides little or no explanation to the court, this factor should weigh heavily in favour of the applicant in successfully making out an abuse of process claim.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">This approach is consistent with the principles set out in <i>Krieger</i>.&nbsp; Acts of prosecutorial discretion are not immune from judicial review.&nbsp; Rather, they are subject to judicial review for abuse of process.&nbsp; Depending on the circumstances, the repudiation of a plea agreement may well constitute an abuse of process, either because it results in trial unfairness or meets the narrow residual category of abuse that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.&nbsp; In applying the <i>Krieger</i> standard to the repudiation of plea agreements, the principles set out in these reasons, notably at paras. 46-48, on the importance of honouring resolution agreements must be kept in mind.&nbsp; Consider, for example, if the repudiation was made arbitrarily, without inquiry into the circumstances leading to the plea agreement, and without regard to any resulting prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; Alternatively, consider if there was evidence of a systemic problem in a particular jurisdiction where Crown counsel regularly and summarily overruled the preceding Crown counsel’s exercise of discretion whenever they disagreed with the terms of the agreed upon plea resolution.&nbsp; In my view, an application judge may well be persuaded in such circumstances that the Crown acted in bad faith or with flagrant impropriety to a degree sufficient to constitute an abuse of process.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Thus, it is my view that a threshold showing must be made before the court embarks on a judicial review of an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Evidence of repudiation meets that threshold.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In this case, I agree with the Court of Appeal that there is no evidence to support a finding of abuse of process.&nbsp; While the application judge asked the wrong question and applied the wrong test for abuse of process, he did inquire into the considerations that informed the decision to repudiate, the process adopted, and the conduct of all Crown actors who were involved.&nbsp; In rejecting Ms. Nixon’s claim that the ADM’s decision was made for an improper motive, he concluded that “there is absolutely no evidence” of political interference (para. 22) and “nothing to suggest that [the ADM’s] action was taken in bad faith or to accommodate a real or perceived political stance of his Minister of Justice” (para. 25).&nbsp; There was also nothing improper in the considerations that informed the ADM’s decision to resile from the agreement.&nbsp; The application judge described these considerations as follows (at para.&nbsp;26):</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Those who influenced [the ADM’s] decision to repudiate the resolution agreement took exception to a pair of [Crown counsel’s] conclusions: first, that the analyses of the breath samples provided by Ms.&nbsp;Nixon would be inadmissible at trial and second, that the evidence of Ryan Galloway, who had earlier observed erratic driving by a van with the same licence plate as hers, was too remote in the circumstances to be relevant to the prosecution.&nbsp; <u>In view of those two mistakes, the Assistant Deputy Minister was persuaded that any agreement which permitted Ms.&nbsp;Nixon to escape <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> convictions was contrary to the public interest, especially considering that two people had died and another had been orphaned as the result of her driving.&nbsp; He therefore concluded that to honour it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[67]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The application judge erred by summarily dismissing the ADM’s considered opinion on the ground that the Crown had to show more than “establish that other, even more senior counsel, have reached a different conclusion” than&nbsp; Crown counsel did (para. 27).&nbsp; On this point, the application judge adopted the reasoning of Hill J. in <i>R. v. M. (R.)</i> (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 349 (S.C.J.).&nbsp; However, the approach adopted in <i>M. (R.)</i> is based on the erroneous view that “the act of <i>repudiation</i> is not an exercise of core prosecutorial discretion” (<i>M. (R.)</i>,<i> </i>at<i> </i>para.&nbsp;65 (emphasis in original)).&nbsp; Hill J. was thus of the view that, while the plea agreement is not reviewable subject only to abuse of process, the repudiation is governed by the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control its own process (para.&nbsp;62).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">As discussed earlier, the ADM’s decision to resile from the plea agreement falls within the scope of prosecutorial discretion.&nbsp; In the absence of any prosecutorial misconduct, improper motive or bad faith in the approach, circumstances, or ultimate decision to repudiate, the decision to proceed with the prosecution is the Crown’s alone to make.&nbsp; Reasonable counsel may indeed, and often do, differ on whether a particular disposition is in the public interest in the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; The ADM, in good faith, determined that Crown counsel’s assessment of the strength of the evidence was erroneous and, on that basis, having regard to the seriousness of the offences, concluded that it would not be in the public interest to terminate the prosecution on the criminal charges.&nbsp; This can hardly be regarded as evidence of misconduct.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">This does not mean that plea agreements can be overturned on a whim.&nbsp; The method by which the decision was reached can itself reveal misconduct of a sufficient degree to amount to abuse of process.&nbsp; But that is not what occurred here.&nbsp; The act of repudiation was indeed a rare and exceptional occurrence.&nbsp; The evidence revealed that there have been only two prior occurrences in Alberta, “one in the 1980s and one within the year prior to the trial in this matter” (Court of Appeal decision, at para. 48).&nbsp; There was also no evidence of abusive conduct in the process leading to the decision to repudiate.&nbsp; I agree with the analysis of Paperny J.A. in this regard (at para. 50):</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:.2pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Further, this is not a case where the repudiation was done “unfairly” or when the discretion of the Attorney General was exercised “irrationally, unreasonably or oppressively”.&nbsp; The ADM carefully reviewed the evidence that was the subject of concern and relied on legal opinions and took guidance from the Ontario Attorney General’s policy to instruct himself on the relevant considerations.&nbsp; Having satisfied himself that the original view of the trial prosecutor was incorrect and that the resulting plea resolution agreement would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, he acted expeditiously in communicating the decision to withdraw the plea resolution agreement to the respondent.&nbsp; He also considered possible prejudice to the respondent and concluded that there would be no such prejudice.&nbsp; The ADM’s conduct, viewed in its totality, cannot be characterized as unfair, unreasonable, oppressive or irrational. The high threshold to find abuse of process has not been met here.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, Ms. Nixon was returned to the position she was in at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing before the plea agreement was entered into. There is no merit to the contention that she suffered prejudice as a result of the repudiation.</span></p>
