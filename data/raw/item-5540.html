   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Appellant, who was then fifteen years old, was called as a witness in the trial of the accused before a judge and twelve jurors. As a result of his refusal to testify, the judge of the Superior Court, criminal side, hearing the case, sentenced him to two months’ detention. The judge had previously dismissed the preliminary objection regarding his jurisdiction <i>ratione personae: </i>appellant argued that he was a child within the meaning of the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act, </i>and that his case could only be heard by a judge of the Youth Court. The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment: hence the appeal to this Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">: The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">It was admitted that if the refusal by the child to testify constituted a <i>Criminal Code </i>offence, the Youth Court had sole jurisdiction. However, in the case at bar, no charge was laid against appellant for a breach of any provision of the <i>Criminal Code </i>or for any other offence making him liable to be committed to an industrial school or juvenile reformatory. Appellant was not prosecuted under s.&nbsp;8 of the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act. </i>As he pointed out himself, the judge acted in accordance with the inherent power of the Court to impose penalties for contempt committed “in the face” of the Court. In the case at bar, the judge was exercising this power by imposing a penalty for the refusal by appellant to testify, and the power may be exercised even with respect to a witness covered by the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act.</i></span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of the Court was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">CHOUINARD J.—Appellant, who was then fifteen years old, a child within the meaning of the <i>Juvenile Delinquent Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, was given two months’ detention for contempt of court as a result of his refusal to testify.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The question is whether the judge of the Superior Court, criminal side, could impose such a penalty or whether appellant should have been tried in the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Social Welfare Court</span><span lang="EN-CA">, now the Youth Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Counsel for the appellant submitted the following summary, which counsel for the respondent described as “scrupulously in accordance with the facts”:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">[TRANSLATION] On November 22, 1976 appellant, Serge Vaillancourt, was convicted of contempt of Court by Jean Moisan, J.S.C., as a result of his refusal to answer certain questions put to him by counsel for the prosecution and the judge during his testimony in the case of Evans Ward.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Mr.&nbsp;Evans Ward was charged with rape and tried before a judge and twelve jurors in the district of Mingan. Appellant was called as a witness by the Crown counsel and asked to testify concerning events involving Mr.&nbsp;Ward. When he appeared in court, appellant answered a number of questions put by the Crown counsel. However, at some point, appellant refused to answer any more questions. In view of this situation, Jean Moisan, J.S.C. cited appellant for contempt of court and deferred the hearing on this contempt to </span><span lang="EN-CA">October 28, 1976</span><span lang="EN-CA">, to allow appellant to obtain counsel.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 71]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">On October 28, 1976 appellant appeared before Jean Moisan J.S.C., accompanied by his counsel, to be tried on the charge of contempt of court. At this appearance counsel for the appellant raised a preliminary objection to the honourable trial judge’s jurisdiction ratione personae. This objection was debated at length and the judgment on the objection handed down on </span><span lang="EN-CA">November 22, 1976</span><span lang="EN-CA">.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, on November 22, 1976 the trial judge rendered judgment on the objection made by counsel for the appellant and dismissed the Iatter’s arguments regarding his jurisdiction ratione personae.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Following this dismissal appellant was convicted of contempt of court and representations were made on either side as to his sentence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">As a result of the representations on sentencing, appellant was ordered to serve two (2) months in prison, with a recommendation that this sentence be served at the Foyer Richelieu in the Town of Hauterive, an institution specializing in youth below the age of eighteen (18).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Appellant’s argument is that as he is a child within the meaning of the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act, </i>his case could only be heard by a judge of the Youth Court. He maintained that his refusal to testify constitutes a criminal offence, one that is covered by the definition of juvenile delinquent. Accordingly, under s.&nbsp;8(1) of the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act, </i>and aside from the exception in s.&nbsp;9 authorizing referral to the ordinary courts, he can only be tried before the Youth Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 2(1) of the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act </i>defines juvenile delinquent as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">“Juvenile delinquent” means any child who violates any provision of the <i>Criminal Code </i>or of any federal or provincial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality, or who is guilty of sexual immorality or any similar form of vice, or who is liable by reason of any other act to be committed to an industrial school or juvenile reformatory under any federal or provincial statute.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Respondent admitted that the Youth Court has sole jurisdiction if, as appellant maintained, his refusal to testify made him a “child who violates</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 72]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">any provision of the <i>Criminal Code</i>…” within the meaning of this subsection, or in the French version of the same subsection “<i>un enfant qui commet une infraction à quelqu’une des dispositions du Code criminel</i>…”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">However, respondent submitted that appellant’s sentence did not result from a conviction for a <i>Criminal Code </i>offence, or any other offence, but from the inherent power of the Court [TRANSLATION] “to punish any action likely to detract from the respect due to the Court or interfere with the administration of justice”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The power enjoyed by a court at common law to impose a penalty for contempt of court was preserved when, in 1953-54, the <i>Criminal Code </i>was amended to abolish common law offences. It is contained in s.&nbsp;8 <i>Cr. </i>C., which reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">8.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act no person shall be convicted</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>of an offence at common law,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>of an offence under an Act of the Parliament of England, or of Great Britain, or of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>c</i>) of an offence under an Act or ordinance in force in any province, territory or place before that province, territory or place became a </span><span lang="EN-CA">province of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA">,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">but nothing in this section&nbsp;affects the power, jurisdiction or authority that a court, judge, justice or magistrate had, immediately before the 1st day of April 1955, to impose punishment for contempt of court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As the trial judge observed:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">[TRANSLATION] The first point to be noted from reading this section&nbsp;is that the legislator makes a very clear distinction between an offence contained in the Criminal Code or in an Act or ordinance in force, and the <u>power, jurisdiction or authority of a Court</u> to impose a penalty for contempt of court. He has accordingly created a very clear distinction between offences and crimes on the one hand, and the power to impose a penalty for contempt of court on the other.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There is no question that the refusal to be sworn or testify constitutes a contempt of court committed “in the face” of the Court according to the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 73]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">wording of the <i>Criminal Code </i>(s. 9). See <i>Re Gerson, Re Nightingale</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[1]</span></span></span></a>.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There is no question in the case at bar that the contempt of court was committed “in the face” of the Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is possible that appellant could have been charged with disobeying an order of the Court under s.&nbsp;116 <i>Cr.C., </i>or with obstructing justice under s.&nbsp;127, and that in such a case only the Youth Court would have had jurisdiction, in accordance with the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act. </i>However, it is not necessary to decide this point because that is not the case.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">No charge was laid against appellant for a breach of any provision of the <i>Criminal Code </i>or of any federal or provincial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality,… or for any other offence making him liable to be committed to an industrial school or juvenile reformatory. Appellant was not prosecuted under s.&nbsp;8 of the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act. </i>As he pointed out himself, the judge hearing the case at bar acted in accordance with the inherent power of the Court to impose penalties for contempt committed “in the face” of the Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>Re Gerson, Re Nightingale, supra, </i>Kerwin J., as he then was, commenting on ss. 165 and 180 <i>Cr. </i>C., now ss. 116 and 127 respectively, said for the Court at p.&nbsp;549:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The argument on this point was that the applicant could be prosecuted under either of these sections&nbsp;and that these proceedings being available the right of the Court to punish for a contempt had been abrogated. Without deciding whether either of these sections&nbsp;would apply in the circumstances, we are of opinion that even if that were so it is a necessary incident to every superior Court of justice to imprison for a contempt of Court committed in the face of it.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This inherent power has been recognized for</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 74]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">several hundred years. In <i>R. v. Almon</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>Wilmot J. expressed the following opinion at p.&nbsp;99:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The power which the Courts in Westminster Hall have of vindicating their own authority, is coeval with their first foundation and institution; it is a necessary incident to every court of Justice, whether of record or not, to fine and imprison for a contempt to the Court, acted in the face of it, 1 Vent. 1. And the issuing of attachments by the Supreme Courts of Justice in Westminster Hall, for contempts out of Court, stands upon the same immemorial usage as supports the whole fabrik of the common law; it is as much as the “lex terrae”, and within the exception of Magna Charta, as the issuing any other legal process whatsoever.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>In re Johnson</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[3]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>Bowen J. of the British Court of Queen’s Bench observed at p.&nbsp;74:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The law has armed the High Court of Justice with power and imposed on it the duty of preventing <i>brevi manu </i>and by summary proceedings any attempt to interfere with the administration of justice.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>Morris v. The Crown Office</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[4]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>Lord Denning noted at p.&nbsp;1081:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The phrase “contempt in the face of the Court” has a quaint old-fashioned ring about it: but the importance of it, is this: of all places where law and order must be maintained, it is here, in these courts. The course of Justice must not be deflected or interfered with. Those who strike at it, strike at the very foundations of our society. To maintain law and order, the judges have, and must have, power at once to deal with those who offend against it. It is a great power—a power instantly to imprison a person without a trial—but it is a necessary power. So necessary indeed that until recently the judges exercised it without any appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>In the matter of Lewis Duncan</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The objection taken by Mr.&nbsp;Duncan to our jurisdiction to cite him for contempt has no foundation. By the provisions of the <i>Supreme Court Act, </i>R.S.C. 1952, c. 529, this Court is a common law and equity Court of record and its power to cite and, in proper circumstances, find a barrister guilty of contempt of Court for words uttered in its presence is beyond question. That</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 75]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">power has been exercised for many years and it is not necessary that steps be taken immediately.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">And Kerwin C.J. cited the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of <i>Halsbury, vol.8 </i>(1954), at p.&nbsp;5:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The power to fine and imprison for a contempt committed in the face of the Court is a necessary incident to every court of justice.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Court was referred to two Canadian cases, in which the power to impose penalties for contempt of court, namely the refusal to testify, was admitted even with respect to a witness covered by the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The first case is that of <i>Daniel Simard v. M. le juge Anatole Corriveau et al., </i>No.&nbsp;200‑38‑000‑003-765, from the Superior Court of Quebec, decided on October 12, 1976. It concerned an application for <i>certiorari </i>against a decision of a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace who, acting as a justice and presiding over a preliminary inquiry, sentenced applicant to seven days in prison for refusing to testify. Dismissing the application, Roberge J. of the Superior Court said, <i>inter alia</i>:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">[TRANSLATION] AS mentioned above, a judge at a preliminary inquiry has powers to impose punishment, when necessary, and it matters little whether the recalcitrant witness is a minor or not; to hold the contrary would be to decide in favour of chaos in the administration of justice.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The other case is <i>Re B.</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[6]</span></span></span></a> from which I reproduce the headnote:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The refusal of a witness to testify after having been sworn may constitute contempt of Court and a superior Court of record has inherent power to commit such a person for contempt. Where the witness is a juvenile the fact that the act of refusing to testify may also constitute an offence under the <i>Criminal Code </i>which, pursuant to s.&nbsp;4 of the <i>Juvenile Delinquents Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, must be tried by a Judge of the juvenile Court does not abrogate from the superior Court’s jurisdiction, which is preserved by s.&nbsp;8 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>to punish the witness for contempt and the Judge of the superior Court may so deal with the contempt if he prefers.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 76]</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">My conclusion is the same. The judge in the case at bar had the power to impose a penalty for contempt committed “in the face” of the Court, namely appellant’s refusal to testify.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Disposition"><i>Appeal dismissed.</i></p> 
   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">Solicitors for the appellant: Hamel, Bernatchez &amp; Associates, Quebec.</span></p> 
   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">Solicitor for the respondent: Paul Chevalier, Sept-Îles.</span></p>
