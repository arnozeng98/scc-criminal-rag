He was one of the principals of a company ("KPA") which offers, for a fee, financial planning services, including advice respecting investment in real estate and tax planning strategies. In 1980, the accused persuaded a property development company to give KPA the exclusive right to sell the units of its MURB project. KPA sold all the units, mainly to its clients, within the relatively short time prescribed in the agreement and received a commission from the development company for each unit sold. These commissions were the same as those which the development company would have paid to any salesman. At trial, the evidence indicated that KPA's clients were unaware of the commissions paid by the development company to KPA. At their initial meeting with new clients, KPA only gave vague and general information as to its sources of remuneration on a "white board". The accused himself later advised his associates that, with respect to the MURB project, he did not want further disclosures in writing. In defence, the accused testified that the clients purchasing the MURB units should have known of the commissions to be paid to KPA from two small references in the Offering Memoranda on the "Issuing and Sales Costs". The accused was convicted on all four counts. The trial judge found that he had an obligation to make full, frank and fair disclosure of the sales commission. The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. The question raised on this appeal is what the Crown must prove in order to obtain a conviction pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec426subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;426(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. In particular, this Court must determine whether s.&nbsp;426 has any application where the party making the payments was not part of a corrupt bargain with the taker.</span></p>

There are three elements to the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence set out in s.&nbsp;426(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) as they apply to an accused agent/taker with regard to the acceptance of a commission: (1)&nbsp;the existence of an agency relationship; (2)&nbsp;the accepting by the agent of a benefit as consideration for doing or forbearing to do any act in relation to the affairs of the agent's principal; and (3)&nbsp;the failure by the agent to make adequate and timely disclosure of the source, amount and nature of the benefit.&nbsp;The word "corruptly" adds that third element to the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence.&nbsp;This word in the context of secret commissions means secretly or without the requisite disclosure.&nbsp;The Crown is not required to prove the existence of a corrupt bargain between the giver and the taker of the reward or benefit.&nbsp;It is thus possible to convict a taker despite the innocence of the giver. </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The requisite <i>mens rea</i> must also be established for each element of the <i>actus reus</i>. Pursuant to s.&nbsp;426(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii), an accused agent/taker (1) must be aware of the agency relationship, (2) must knowingly accept the benefit as consideration for an act to be undertaken in relation to the affairs of the principal, and (3) must be aware of the extent of the disclosure to the principal or lack thereof. When an accused is aware that some disclosure was made, the court must determine whether, in all the circumstances of the particular case, the disclosure was in fact adequate and timely. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here,&nbsp;the Crown has established all the elements requisite for conviction under s.&nbsp;426.&nbsp;It is clear that an agency relationship existed between the accused and his clients and that he was aware of the existence of that relationship.&nbsp;It is also clear that the nature of the commission paid by the development company was to encourage the accused to influence his clients to purchase the MURB units and that he was aware of this intention. He accepted the commission secretly and influenced the affairs of his principals. Finally, the payment of the commission was not disclosed in an adequate and timely manner. At the time of the sales, KPA's clients were not aware that KPA would receive a sales commission from the development company for each MURB unit sold to KPA clients. KPA disclosure of its sources of remuneration was vague and general and did not meet the objectives of s.&nbsp;426. The accused himself made a conscious decision to limit the extent of the disclosure. While the Offering Memoranda for the MURB units contained two one-line references to "Issuing and Sales Costs" for the projects, there was no specific reference to the fact that it was the accused who was to receive these costs as a commission. </span></p>

No corrupt bargain is required. However, since criminal law must be certain and definitive, the time and the degree of disclosure must be clearly defined. Agents must be given fair notice in advance whether a proposed course of conduct is criminal. With respect to the timing of disclosure, certainty requires that where the gravamen of the offence is the taking of a secret commission disclosure to the principal must be made by the time the commission is accepted. If the agent accepts a commission without beforehand (or simultaneously) advising the principal of the fact, the offence is established. With respect to the degree of disclosure, it is not enough to state at the beginning of a relationship between an agent and his principal that commissions may from time to time be taken. The requirements of s. 426(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) will only be satisfied if the agent discloses to the principal that he will receive a commission with respect to the transaction in question. The amount of the commission is secondary and need not be disclosed in order to escape liability. The communication that the agent will receive a commission with respect to the particular transaction in issue will put the principal on notice that the agent is in a potential conflict of interest. Here, since there was no disclosure of the particular commission to the principals involved, the offence is made out. </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Sopinka&nbsp;J. (dissenting): When an agent is charged with accepting a benefit under s. 426(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) of the <i>Code</i>, it must be established that he accepted the benefit as a <i>quid pro quo</i> to influence him. To secure a conviction, the Crown must prove two essentials of the mental element of the offence: (1) that the benefit was so accepted with the agent's knowledge or belief that it was given for the purpose of influencing him; and (2) that the agent entered into the transaction <i>mala fide</i>. The first requirement looks to the state of mind of the agent at the time of the transaction. The corruption in this action is the belief that the valuable consideration is intended to influence the agent to show favour to some person in relation to the affairs of his principal. The taker is thus caught even if he was mistaken as to the true intention of the giver. The offence is complete without the necessity of showing that the agent was in fact influenced in his actions. It is his state of mind in accepting the consideration that is crucial. The second requirement is most easily satisfied through proof of dishonesty.&nbsp; Non-disclosure by the taker is not synonymous with the terms "corruptly" or <i>mala fides</i>, although it may be a strong indicator that the agent has acted in bad faith. In some situations disclosure or the intent to disclose will be highly relevant.&nbsp; </span></p>

The agreement was entered into at arm's length, the commissions were the same amount as was paid to any other salesmen and they were to be paid regardless of to whom the units were sold. The decision to sell to his clients was one that the accused made unilaterally. His failure to make full disclosure amounted to a breach of his duty but he is not guilty of the offence charged.</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The disclosure must be timely in the sense that the principal must be made aware of the benefit as soon as possible.&nbsp; Certainly the disclosure must be made at the point when the reward may influence the agent in relation to the principal's affairs.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">This passage begs a number of questions.&nbsp; When is the crime complete?&nbsp; What is meant by "as soon as possible"?&nbsp; Is it a defence for the agent to say that the point had not yet been reached when he or she might be influenced?&nbsp; If so, when is that point?&nbsp; To pose these questions is to admit of the possibility of a variety of different answers.</span></p>

An offence is complete upon commission of a particular act or acts, the <i>actus reus</i>, accompanied by the requisite blameworthy mental state, the <i>mens rea</i>. Thus, for example, the offence of assault is complete when a person without the consent of another applies force to that other person, the <i>actus reus</i>, and does so with the intention of applying force to that other person without that other person's consent. The act is committed with the necessary intent and the offence is complete in a single, unified transaction. Under Cory J.'s analysis of the offence of taking secret commissions the agent may commit part of the <i>actus reus</i>, the taking of the commission in the requisite circumstances, and do so with part of the <i>mens rea</i>, namely knowledge of the circumstances constituting the <i>actus reus</i> to that point. But his ultimate guilt is at that point uncertain, dependent upon whether he fails "to make adequate and timely disclosure of the source, amount and nature of the benefit", the remainder of the <i>actus reus</i>, with an awareness of "the extent of the disclosure to the principal or lack thereof", the remainder of the <i>mens rea</i>.&nbsp; Under Cory J.'s analysis the commission of part of this offence can be deferred in accordance with the prevailing circumstances.&nbsp; If at that point in time which a trial judge with the benefit of hindsight determines to have been "timely" the agent has not made full disclosure and is aware of the lack of disclosure, the <i>actus reus</i> and&nbsp; <i>mens rea</i> appear, transforming non-criminal conduct into criminal conduct. It is as if the offence lies dormant, waiting to be brought to germination by the bright light of judicial contemplation.</span></p>

First, a law that does not give fair notice to a person of the conduct that is contemplated as criminal, is subject to a s. 7 challenge to the extent that such a law may deprive a person of liberty and security of the person in a manner that does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice. Clearly, it seems to me that if a person is placed at risk of being deprived of his liberty when he has not been given fair notice that his conduct falls within the scope of the offence as defined by Parliament, then surely this would offend the principles of fundamental justice. Second, where a separate <i>Charter</i> right or freedom has been limited by legislation, the doctrine of vagueness or overbreadth may be considered in determining whether the limit is "prescribed by law" within the meaning of s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">It is vagueness in the first sense mentioned by Lamer J. which is raised by the "after-the-fact" approach to the determination of when disclosure is timely that is advocated by Cory J.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dickson C.J., La Forest and Sopinka JJ. concurring, agreed that it would be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice to permit a person to be deprived of his or her liberty for the violation of a vague law.&nbsp; As Dickson C.J. put it (at p. 1141):</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Certainly in the criminal context where a person's liberty is at stake, it is imperative that persons be capable of knowing in advance with a high degree of certainty what conduct is prohibited and what is not. It would be contrary to the basic principles of our legal system to allow individuals to be imprisoned for transgression of a vague law. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hovering possibility of criminality, which may come into being when in the circumstances it is deemed (after the fact) to have been timely to disclose, offends the fundamental requirement that the criminal law be certain. Simply put, agents will not thereby be given fair notice in advance whether a proposed course of conduct is criminal. Not only is this lack of predictability potentially unfair, it is also calculated to lessen the deterrent effect of the existence of the criminal prohibition, since people may put off disclosure which they ought to make because, as they see the circumstances at the time, no disclosure is necessary.&nbsp; Finally, it raises the question of whether an agent, who, at a certain time ought in all the circumstances to have disclosed a reward, is entitled to be acquitted because he did not realize that it was time to disclose.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, if lack of disclosure is an element of the offence, then the time for disclosure must be clear and certain in law.&nbsp; Rather than holding the offence in suspended animation pending some future event which will determine the timeliness of disclosure, I would fix the time at which disclosure must be made.&nbsp; Where the <i>actus reus</i> is the <u>taking</u> of a secret commission, then the relevant time to see whether there has been a failure to disclose is the time the commission is <u>taken</u>.&nbsp; For practical purposes, this means that if the agent accepts a commission without beforehand (or simultaneously, if that can be conceived) advising the principal of the fact, the offence is established.&nbsp; It is up to the agent to refuse the commission unless he or she has first advised the principal of his or her intention to take it.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, in my view, makes practical sense.&nbsp; To allow an agent to accept a secret commission on the basis that he or she will tell the principal "as soon as possible" is to encourage the acceptance of such commissions: the road to crime, as to hell, may be paved with good intentions.&nbsp; On the other hand, to require the agent to clear the matter with his or her principal before accepting the commission imposes no undue hardship.&nbsp; Assume, for example, the arrival in the mail of an unsolicited commission.&nbsp; The agent cannot accept the cash or cash the cheque, as the case may be, until he or she has advised the principal of the commission. I see only good coming from such a requirement.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn from the timing of disclosure to the question of degree of disclosure.&nbsp; Here again the governing consideration is that the criminal law must be clear and certain.&nbsp; Cory J. states that the amount of the commission must be stated to the "best of the agent's ability", and concludes (at p. 000):</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the accused was aware that some disclosure was made then it will be for the court to determine whether, in all the circumstances of the particular case, it was in fact adequate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">This "after-the-fact" standard is, in my opinion, too vague to meet the requirements of the criminal law.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Cory J. that the extent of disclosure required depends on the purpose which the disclosure requirement is intended to further.&nbsp; I agree with Cory J. as well that "disclosure is essential to alert the principal to the existence of conflict of interest situations" (p. 23).&nbsp; It is to the avoidance of conflicts of interest and the consequent danger that the agent may not act exclusively in the best interests of his or her principals that the disclosure requirement is directed.&nbsp; The <u>amount</u> of the commission is purely secondary.&nbsp; A large commission might tempt one agent; a small one might suffice for another.&nbsp; Moreover, a requirement that the amount of the commission be disclosed poses practical difficulties of calculation, as Cory J. recognizes. These are exacerbated if disclosure is to be made either simultaneously with acceptance of the commission, or, as would be practically necessary under my reasoning, in advance.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, all that is required by the criminal law is that if an agent is contemplating taking a commission from a third party with respect to a transaction with his principal, then the agent must disclose the fact that he will receive the commission to the principal, specifically advising the principal of the transaction to which the commission will relate.&nbsp; Such a communication will put the principal on notice that the agent is in a potential conflict of interest.&nbsp; It will then be open to the principal to decline to enter the transaction, to ask for further details or amounts, or to take such other steps as he or she may choose. The objective of the section will be achieved, and the question as to whether the agent's conduct is criminal will not hang on arguments over whether the agent has made a "reasonable effort" to state the amount of the commission to the "best of [his or her] ability" "in all the circumstances of the particular case".&nbsp; I add that it cannot be enough to state at the beginning of a relationship that commissions may from time to time be taken.&nbsp; The offence relates to a particular taking, and so, it follows, must disclosure.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the facts of this case it is clear that there was no disclosure of the particular commissions to the principals involved.&nbsp; Therefore the offence is made out.</span></p>
