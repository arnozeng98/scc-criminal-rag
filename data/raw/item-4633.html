line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal raises two central issues. First, what is the appropriate standard to be applied by courts in reviewing a decision by the Minister to order surrender? Second, in light of that standard, should the Minister’s decision be set aside in this case? In connection with these issues, the appellant also contends that the Minister did not provide adequate reasons for ordering his surrender.&nbsp; He argues that while deference is generally owed to a decision by the Minister to order surrender, where an individual’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights are engaged, the appropriate standard of review is correctness. The respondent submits that, according to the jurisprudence of this Court, the Minister’s assessment of a fugitive’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights is also entitled to deference. The nature of the Minister’s decision requires him, even when considering a fugitive’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights, to weigh competing factors, many of which include foreign policy considerations in which the Minister has superior expertise. Heightened scrutiny and interference by the judiciary has the potential to seriously disrupt the extradition regime, which engages Canada’s international obligations and serves as an important tool in the suppression of crime.</p>

The Crown alleged that at the time, he was a U.S. citizen residing in Detroit.&nbsp; The charges were laid as a result of an undercover operation of the Windsor unit of the O.P.P. Drug Enforcement Branch.&nbsp; Mr. Lake became known to one of the investigators, Constable Ralph Faiella, as a result of a meeting between Constable Faiella and the appellant’s cousin, Aaron Walls, in Windsor. In August&nbsp;1997, Mr. Walls, a lifetime resident of Windsor, offered to sell Constable Faiella crack cocaine, which he said Mr. Lake would bring from Detroit. The officer agreed and a meeting was arranged. At the meeting, Constable Faiella was introduced to Mr. Lake and paid him C$1,700 in exchange for 25 grams of crack cocaine.</p>

The transaction was intercepted and recorded by the F.B.I. The total weight of the cocaine purchased by Constable Faiella was later determined to be approximately 99.2 grams.</p>

On December 8, 1997, he telephoned Mr. Lake and set up a transaction for another four ounces of cocaine the following day. He met Mr. Walls and another man at a Windsor convenience store, where both men were immediately arrested. A search warrant was then executed at the Walls residence, and when the police arrived, Mr. Lake was in the backyard with another man and was seen to be placing something at the base of a fence. Mr. Lake was arrested, and the item seized next to the fence was found to be a plastic bag containing 65 grams of crack cocaine.</p>

Crown counsel indicated that the motivating factor in his agreeing to a three-year sentence, which he acknowledged to be “on the low end of the range with respect to these types of offences”, was that he had recently received a copy of an indictment against the appellant issued in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, for the offence of trafficking in cocaine allegedly committed on September 22, 1997. Given the compelling evidence against the appellant, Crown counsel was of the view that Mr. Lake faced a strong likelihood of conviction in the United States on this charge and would therefore likely serve time there in addition to his sentence on the Canadian charges. At the time, although the appellant claimed to be a Canadian citizen by virtue of the fact that his mother had been born in Canada, he could not offer any proof of his Canadian citizenship and it was expected that deportation proceedings would take place upon conclusion of his sentence.</p>

On June 30, 2003, the Minister issued an authority to proceed. On May 31, 2004, Mr. Lake was committed for extradition. His counsel made submissions to the Minister, arguing against surrender on several grounds. However, the Minister ordered Mr. Lake’s surrender on February 28, 2005.</p>

Although the Minister indicated that he would not interfere with this exercise of prosecutorial discretion, he nevertheless went on to consider whether the decision to prefer extradition over prosecution in Canada was consistent with Mr. Lake’s rights under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec6subsec1" target="_blank">s. 6(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Given that the transfer of cocaine was alleged to have taken place in Detroit, the Minister concluded that Canada did not have jurisdiction to prosecute the offence. Even if some form of prosecution in Canada were possible for this offence, he would have yielded to the superior interest of the United States in protecting its own public and maintaining public confidence in its laws and criminal justice system through prosecution. In the Minister’s opinion, surrender would not unjustifiably infringe Mr. Lake’s rights under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec6subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;6(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

He decided that although the Canadian and American charges arose from the same investigation and involved overlapping conduct, they were separate and distinct and concerned two different wrongs. Ordering Mr. Lake’s surrender therefore would not violate Art. 4 of the <i>Treaty on Extradition Between Canada and the United States of America</i>, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3, or <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1999-c-18-en#!fragment/sec47" target="_blank">s. 47<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1999-c-18-en" target="_blank">Extradition Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1999-c-18-en" target="_blank">, S.C. 1999, c. 18<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.

He noted that the delay between the end of Mr. Lake’s Canadian sentence and the request was only two years, and that Mr. Lake was aware of the indictment at the time of his Canadian sentencing hearing and could have turned himself in at any time in order to deal with the charge expeditiously. There was no suggestion that the delay had affected the possibility that Mr. Lake would receive a fair trial in the United States or his ability to make full answer and defence. The Minister also observed that the mandatory 10-year minimum sentence Mr. Lake would face if convicted in the United States would not “shock the conscience” of Canadians, nor would it be unjust or oppressive in light of the seriousness of the allegations against him. Nor would Mr. Lake’s personal circumstances justify refusing surrender. According to the Minister, while it was commendable that Mr.&nbsp;Lake was supporting his common law spouse and their children in Windsor, this fact did not amount to a compelling or overriding circumstance that outweighed the importance of ensuring that Canada was not used as a safe haven by fugitives from justice.</p>

Such reasons should explain why the surrender order was made and should be sufficient to permit the reviewing court to determine whether the Minister applied the proper principles and fairly considered any submissions against surrender.

In making this assessment, the Minister was required to apply the correct legal test, but his weighing of the factors relevant to that test was entitled to deference. Though the Minister had erred in concluding that Canada had no jurisdiction to prosecute Mr. Lake for the substantive offence of trafficking, this error was unimportant given that he had gone on to conclude that even if some form of prosecution in Canada was in fact possible, the United States had a greater interest in prosecuting Mr. Lake. Contrary to the appellant’s submission, the Minister is not required to refer expressly to all the <i>Cotroni</i> factors. Citing this Court’s decision in <i>United States of America v. Kwok</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 532, 2001 SCC 18, Laskin J.A. concluded that the Minister’s decision would be upheld if it was “clearly reasonable”.

Rather, to infringe s. 7, the foreign sentence must “shock the conscience” (<i>Canada v. Schmidt</i>,<i> </i>[1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p.&nbsp;522) or be “simply unacceptable” (<i>United States v. Allard</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 564, at p. 572). Under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1999-c-18-en#!fragment/sec44subsec1" target="_blank">s. 44(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, the sentence must be “unjust” or “oppressive”.&nbsp; A mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for distributing nearly 100 grams of a lethal drug is not so shocking or unjust as to warrant judicial intervention. The appellant had also argued that the sentence would be disproportionate given that courts generally impose concurrent sentences for a conviction on a substantive offence and a conviction on conspiracy to commit that offence. He submitted that he would effectively be serving consecutive sentences for the offences in the instant case. In Laskin J.A.’s view, however, proportionality is relevant only if the sentence is so extreme that it offends what is fair and just. He considered the sentence faced by the appellant to fall far short of that standard, particularly given that the U.S. indictment had been taken into account at Mr. Lake’s sentencing hearing in Canada.</p>

La Forest J. elaborated on these objectives, and on the importance of international co-operation in achieving them, in <i>Cotroni</i>, at p. 1485:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The investigation, prosecution and suppression of crime for the protection of the citizen and the maintenance of peace and public order is an important goal of all organized societies. The pursuit of that goal cannot realistically be confined within national boundaries. That has long been the case, but it is increasingly evident today. Modern communications have shrunk the world and made McLuhan’s global village a reality. The only respect paid by the international criminal community to national boundaries is when these can serve as a means to frustrate the efforts of law enforcement and judicial authorities. The trafficking in drugs, with which we are here concerned, is an international enterprise and requires effective tools of international cooperation for its investigation, prosecution and suppression. Extradition is an important and well-established tool for effecting this cooperation.</p>

After canvassing the important objectives of extradition, La Forest J., for the majority, rejected the argument that extraditing a Canadian citizen to face charges on which he can be prosecuted in Canada is irrational. It may be easier to prosecute a Canadian citizen in a foreign jurisdiction owing to the availability of witnesses or evidence. In addition, the foreign jurisdiction may have a greater interest in prosecuting the offence. In concluding that the right was minimally impaired by the extradition process, he noted that “extradition practices have been tailored as much as possible for the protection of the liberty of the individual” (p. 1490).</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>On the issue of where a fugitive should be prosecuted, La Forest J. stated that “to require judicial examination of each individual case to see which could more effectively and fairly be tried in one country or the other would pose an impossible task and seriously interfere with the workings of the system” (p. 1494). Citing this Court’s decisions in <i>R. v. Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, and <i>R. v. Beare</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, he noted that prosecutorial discretion is consistent with the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and will not be interfered with absent evidence of improper or arbitrary motives. La&nbsp;Forest&nbsp;J. went on to list the considerations, now known as the “<i>Cotroni</i> factors”, that will generally be considered in determining whether to prosecute in this country or to allow authorities in a foreign jurisdiction to seek extradition. These factors include:</p>

The list merely identifies some of the factors that will tend to favour either extradition or prosecution in Canada. To instruct prosecutorial authorities on how to decide whether to prosecute would deprive the concept of prosecutorial discretion of all meaning. The responsibility for deciding which factors are determinative lies with the authorities themselves; the list serves simply to highlight the relevant factors. The exercise of prosecutorial discretion will be interfered with in only the clearest of cases, such as where there is evidence of bad faith or improper motives. Absent such evidence, the infringement of an individual’s s.&nbsp;6(1) mobility rights upon surrender will not be unjustified merely because the Minister has decided, rather than prosecuting the individual in Canada, to defer to the foreign authorities seeking extradition.</p>

In <i>Schmidt</i>, La&nbsp;Forest J. emphasized that deference is owed to the Minister’s assessment:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">The courts have the duty to uphold the Constitution. Nonetheless, this is an area where the executive is likely to be far better informed than the courts, and where the courts must be extremely circumspect so as to avoid interfering unduly in decisions that involve the good faith and honour of this country in its relations with other states. In a word, judicial intervention must be limited to cases of real substance. [p. 523]</p>

In <i>United States v. Burns</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, 2001 SCC 7, the Court reaffirmed the <i>Kindler </i>approach but added that the words “shock the conscience” should not “be allowed to obscure the ultimate assessment that is required: namely whether or not the extradition is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice” (para. 68). In making this assessment, the relevant factors may be specific to the fugitive, such as age or mental condition, or general, such as considerations associated with a particular form of punishment.</p>

In addition, the Minister was unable to “poin[t] to any public purpose that would be served by extradition <i>without</i> assurances that is not substantially served by extradition <i>with </i>assurances” (para. 125 (emphasis in original)). <i>Burns </i>thus serves as an example of the kind of critical circumstances in which a reviewing court will interfere with the Minister’s decision.</p>

The assertion that interference with the Minister’s decision will be limited to exceptional cases of “real substance” reflects the breadth of the Minister’s discretion; the decision should not be interfered with unless it is unreasonable (<i>Schmidt</i>) (for comments on the standards of correctness and reasonableness, see <i>Dunsmuir v.

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>First, it should be noted that in<i> Kwok</i>, Arbour J. was responding to an argument by the appellant in that case that <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec6subsec1" target="_blank">s. 6(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is relevant at the committal stage. In support of this argument, Mr. Kwok had stated that the Minister is not a “‘court of competent jurisdiction’, empowered by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>to grant constitutional remedies”:&nbsp; para. 80. Although she acknowledged that the Minister cannot grant remedies for a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breach, Arbour J. pointed out that the Minister’s decision is subject to judicial review by the provincial court of appeal. If a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breach occurs, the appellate court is empowered to grant an appropriate remedy. However, this line of reasoning sheds no light on the standard the appellate court should apply in reviewing the Minister’s decision in order to determine whether such a breach has occurred. It merely refutes the argument that any infringement of s. 6(1) rights must be assessed at the committal hearing.</p>

Whereas the Minister’s discretion must be exercised in accordance with the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, his assessment of any <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> infringement that could result from ordering an individual’s surrender is closely intertwined with his responsibility to ensure that Canada fulfills its international obligations. The right of a Canadian citizen under s. 6(1) to remain in Canada is <i>prima facie </i>infringed by a decision to order that citizen’s surrender for extradition, but the infringement can generally be justified under s. 1, as this Court held in <i>Cotroni</i>.&nbsp; In determining whether the infringement is justified, the Minister is required to consider not only “the possibility of prosecution in Canada, but also the interest of the foreign State in prosecuting the fugitive on its own territory”: <i>Kwok</i>, at para. 93. Accordingly, the Minister’s assessment of whether the infringement of s. 6(1) is justified rests largely on his decision whether Canada should defer to the interests of the requesting state. This is largely a political decision, not a legal one. The legal threshold&nbsp; for finding it unacceptable is evidence that the decision not to prosecute in Canada was made for improper or arbitrary motives.&nbsp; This leaves room for considerable deference to the Minister’s conclusion that the infringement of s. 6(1) is justified.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Similarly, the Minister’s assessment of whether extradition accords with the fugitive’s s. 7 rights involves a balancing test. As I mentioned above, the Minister must weigh the factors for and against extradition to determine whether the circumstances are such that extradition would “shock the conscience”. In<i> Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, 2002 SCC 1, this Court considered the appropriate standard of review for the Minister’s decision whether a refugee faces a substantial risk of torture upon deportation. In its view, the Minister’s decision in that context requires a fact-driven inquiry involving the weighing of various factors and possessing a “negligible legal dimension” (para. 39). Accordingly, the Court concluded that the Minister’s decision would be entitled to deference upon judicial review.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Whether extradition would “shock the conscience” involves a similar type of inquiry. The Minister must balance the individual’s circumstances and the consequences of extradition against such factors as the seriousness of the offence for which extradition is sought and the importance of meeting Canada’s international obligations and generally ensuring that Canada is not used as a safe haven by fugitives from justice. This inquiry will also often involve consideration of the protections that would be available to the fugitive and the conditions he or she would face in the requesting state. To say, as does the appellant in the instant case, that the decision whether surrender would unjustifiably infringe a fugitive’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights remains fundamentally a legal matter is to disregard the reality that <i>all</i> executive and administrative decisions involving one’s rights are in essence “legal matters”. Yet not all such decisions are subject to judicial review on a correctness standard.&nbsp; The decision in issue in <i>Suresh</i> was clearly a legal matter. The Court concluded that deference was owed to the Minister’s decision because it was based primarily on the Minister’s assessment of the facts; there was generally no need for the court to re-weigh the facts. The same is true in the extradition context.</p>

Canada (Minister of Justice) </i>(1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 423; <i>United States of America v. Gillingham </i>(2004), 184 C.C.C. (3d) 97; <i>United States of America v. Maydak </i>(2004), 190 C.C.C.

Fordham </i>(2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 39;<i> Ganis v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i> (2006), 216 C.C.C. (3d) 337. In <i>Stewart</i>, the first case in which a court held that the appropriate standard was correctness, Donald&nbsp;J.A. expressed the concern that “[i]f deference were accorded [the Minister’s] assessment of the constitutional validity of [his] own act then I believe that judicial review would be unacceptably attenuated” (para. 18). With respect, this concern is misplaced.&nbsp; It rests on an incorrect understanding of the Minister’s role in&nbsp; assessing the interests at stake in the extradition context.&nbsp; It is also inconsistent with this Court’s jurisprudence on the judicial review of extradition decisions.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[41]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Reasonableness does not require blind submission to the Minister’s assessment; however, the standard does entail more than one possible conclusion. The reviewing court’s role is not to re-assess the relevant factors and substitute its own view. Rather, the court must determine whether the Minister’s decision falls within a range of reasonable outcomes. To apply this standard in the extradition context, a court must ask whether the Minister considered the relevant facts and reached a defensible conclusion based on those facts. I agree with Laskin J.A. that the Minister must, in reaching his decision, apply the correct legal test. The Minister’s conclusion will not be rational or defensible if he has failed to carry out the proper analysis. If, however, the Minister has identified the proper test, the conclusion he has reached in applying that test should be upheld by a reviewing court unless it is unreasonable. This approach does not minimize the protection afforded by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. It merely reflects the fact that in the extradition context, the proper assessments under ss. 6(1) and 7 involve primarily fact-based balancing tests. Given the Minister’s expertise and his obligation to ensure that Canada complies with its international commitments, he is in the best position to determine whether the factors weigh in favour of or against extradition.</p>

As I explained above, s. 6(1) requires the Minister to consider the possibility of prosecution in Canada. The Minister concluded that Canada did not have jurisdiction to prosecute the appellant for the substantive offence of trafficking that was based on the conduct that occurred in Detroit on September 22, 1997. However, he went on to say that regardless of whether or not Canada had jurisdiction to prosecute the appellant for that conduct, he would defer to the greater interest of the United States. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that Canada does have jurisdiction to prosecute the appellant, the issue is whether it was reasonable for the Minister to conclude that his extradition to the United States constitutes a justifiable infringement of his s. 6(1) rights.</p>

Nor did he argue that the Minister’s decision conflicted with Art. 4 of the Treaty, which prohibits extradition if the fugitive has already been convicted of or discharged for the alleged offence. Rather, the appellant focusses on the allegation that it would be unfair to extradite him on the trafficking charge, because he has already been prosecuted and sentenced in Canada. This, he argues, is a relevant factor to be considered in determining whether the infringement of his s. 6(1) rights can be justified under s. 1.</p>

The appellant was not charged with the substantive offence of trafficking in relation to the transaction of September 22, 1997. Although it is true that he was charged with conspiracy to traffic in narcotics on dates that included September 22, 1997, a charge of conspiracy does not subsume the substantive offence. An individual may be convicted both of conspiracy and of the substantive offence that was the object of that conspiracy: <i>Sheppe v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 22.&nbsp; If an accused is convicted on both charges, the usual order is that the sentences be served concurrently. However, even if an accused is charged only with conspiracy, evidence that he or she actually committed the substantive offence will generally lead to a harsher sentence than if the accused had conspired to commit it but had not actually done so.</p>

After reviewing the transcript of the sentencing hearing and the agreed statement of facts, the Minister noted that the sentencing judge had made no reference to the U.S. indictment and that Crown counsel had advised the court that he was seeking a <i>reduced </i>sentence in light of that indictment. Although the agreed statement of facts does make reference to the transaction of September 22, 1997, the clear implication of Crown counsel’s words at the sentencing hearing was that he was not seeking to punish the appellant for the Detroit transaction precisely because he expected the appellant to be punished for that offence in the United States.

The Minister’s reasons must make it clear that he considered the individual’s submissions against extradition and must provide some basis for understanding why those submissions were rejected. Though the Minister’s <i>Cotroni</i> analysis was brief in the instant case, it was in my view sufficient. The Minister is not required to provide a detailed analysis for every factor.

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In the case at bar, the Minister stated that he had considered the <i>Cotroni </i>factors, and in reaching his conclusion he emphasized that the alleged conduct had occurred in the United States:</p>

<div class="Section33">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">. . . I would yield to the superior interest of the United States of America in prosecuting this matter. The evidence alleges that Mr. Lake trafficked cocaine within the boundaries of the United States of America. The United States of America is entitled to seek to protect its own public and maintain public confidence in its laws and criminal justice system through prosecution. [A.R., at p. 17]</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Although the <i>locus delicti </i>may not always be determinative, in this case, there is nothing unreasonable about the Minister’s conclusion. There is no other factor that would clearly outweigh the fact that the alleged conduct occurred in the United States. The appellant points to the severity of the punishment he will face upon conviction in the United States. However, this Court has upheld other decisions by the Minister to extradite individuals who face long prison sentences for drug offences: <i>United States of America v. Jamieson</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 465; <i>United States of America v. Whitley</i> (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 99 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d by and reasons adopted at&nbsp; [1996] 1 S.C.R. 467; <i>Ross v. United States of America </i>(1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 500 (B.C.C.A.), aff’d by and reasons adopted at [1996] 1 S.C.R. 469. The sentence does not on its own provide a sufficient basis for interfering with a decision by the Minister to surrender a fugitive for extradition. The Minister’s deference to the United States owing to the fact that the alleged conduct occurred within its territory provides a sufficient basis for concluding that his decision was reasonable.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">IV. <u>Conclusion</u></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="Section34">
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>In light of this Court’s jurisprudence, it is clear that a reviewing court owes deference to a decision by the Minister to order surrender, including the Minister’s assessment of the individual’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights. Although the Minister must apply the proper legal principles, his decision should be upheld unless it is unreasonable. In the case at bar, the Minister identified the proper test and provided reasons that were sufficient to indicate the basis for his decision to order the appellant’s surrender.&nbsp; In my view, his decision to extradite the appellant rather than pursue prosecution in Canada is not unreasonable. The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
