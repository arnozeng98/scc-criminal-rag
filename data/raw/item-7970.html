 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However<span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">, there is a significant difference between a legal error that can be confidently dismissed as “harmless”, and an assessment that while the error is prejudicial, it is not (in the after‑the‑fact view of the appellate court) so prejudicial as to have affected the outcome.&nbsp; Such delicate assessments are foreign to the purpose of the curative proviso which is to avoid a retrial that would be superfluous and unnecessary but to set high the Crown’s burden of establishing those prerequisites.&nbsp; The same can be said for the other branch of the curative proviso. As a result, the burden of the Crown to demonstrate an “overwhelming” case or a “harmless” error of law should not be relaxed.</span></p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> </span>Deschamps<span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">, Rothstein and Cromwell&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; The issue is not whether the evidence of guilt was “overwhelming”, nor is the Court’s task here to try to predict what effect a particular line of argument might have had on the jury’s assessment of a witness’s credibility.&nbsp; The issue is whether there was any reasonable possibility that the error could have had any impact on the verdict.&nbsp; Failure to provide instructions on attempted murder would only have been relevant if the jury had a doubt about causation.&nbsp; The trial judge, by everyone’s agreement, flawlessly directed the jury on the offence of murder, including the requirement that the shooting caused the deceased’s death.&nbsp; The trial judge provided the jury with a decision tree which clearly indicated, as had the judge’s instructions, that in order to convict, the jury must unanimously be of the view that the Crown had proved causation beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The jury deliberated for five days.&nbsp; They asked no questions about causation.&nbsp; They returned a verdict of guilty of second degree murder against both accused.&nbsp; The jury’s verdict of guilty of second degree murder necessarily reflected the jury’s finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the shooting had indeed caused the victim’s death.&nbsp; That is the only conclusion with respect to causation that is consistent with the jury’s verdict.&nbsp; Appellate courts should not speculate at the jury’s expense and impute to jurors a subconscious failure to fulfill their sworn duty. Nor should they simply assert that the trial judge’s omitted instruction to the jury gave rise to an injustice.&nbsp; Therefore, the Crown has discharged its burden to show that if the legal error here — the failure to instruct on attempted murder — had not been made, the result would inevitably have been the same. </span></p>

Nette</i>, 2001 SCC 78, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488, at para. 72).&nbsp; If the evidence of the Crown pathologist left the members of the jury with a doubt on that account, then at most the respondents could be convicted of an <i>attempt</i> to murder — an attempt foiled by the skill of the surgeon, Dr. Freeman.&nbsp; If that view were taken by the jury (and of course we do not know what its members thought), the appropriate verdict (attempted murder) was not one of the options given to them.&nbsp; Instead, the Crown took the position that the jury should be told to acquit the respondents if it had a reasonable doubt on the question of causation, a prospect which the jury may well have found disturbing.&nbsp; It was also wrong in law.&nbsp; As Arbour J. had pointed out in <i>Nette</i>, where “causation was not proven, a proper verdict might be attempted murder” (para. 47).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">On the Crown’s view that attempted murder is not an included offence to murder, it would follow that if the jury had acquitted the respondents of murder, the Crown could have proceeded at a subsequent trial on a charge of attempted murder.&nbsp; The contrary view, that attempted murder <i>is</i> an included offence, is supported by Doherty J.A.’s meticulous analysis of the relevant <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>provisions (ss. 660 to 662) and related case law.&nbsp; He concluded that “[t]he community as a whole and the participants in a criminal proceeding, be they accused, witness, juror, or investigator, are best served by a process that allows all issues to be resolved in a single trial” (para. 59).&nbsp; I cannot improve on his analysis and I will not repeat it.&nbsp; I note that Moldaver J.A. agreed that the potential verdict of attempted murder should have been left with the jury and that it was an error of law not to do so.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">The emphasis, necessarily, is on the words “no realistic possibility that a new trial would produce a different verdict”.&nbsp; Section 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) <i>Cr.

Haughton</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516, where the issue was the subjective foresight of the victim’s death, allows an appellate court in some circumstances to apply the curative proviso on the basis of factual findings implicit in a murder conviction where the jury is instructed on an included offence but the instruction is tainted by legal error.</span></p>

(as he then was) dissenting in the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; However, I respectfully disagree with my colleague on the application of the proviso in the circumstances of this case.&nbsp; No one questions that the trial judge gave the jury complete and accurate instructions on causation.&nbsp; The jury’s verdict necessarily means that they were persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the gunshots caused the deceased’s death.&nbsp; The admitted error was failing to provide instructions on attempted murder. Those instructions would only have been relevant if the jury had a doubt about causation, which, as their verdict unambiguously attests, they did not.&nbsp; In those circumstances, in my respectful opinion, the error clearly had no impact on the verdict.

The trial judge provided the jury with a decision tree which clearly indicated, as had the judge’s instructions, that in order to convict, the jury must unanimously be of the view that the Crown had proved causation beyond a reasonable doubt (A.R., vol. XV, at p. 157).&nbsp; The jury deliberated for five days.&nbsp; They asked no questions about causation.&nbsp; They returned a verdict of guilty of second degree murder against both respondents. The jury’s verdict of guilty of second degree murder necessarily reflected the jury’s finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the shooting had indeed caused the deceased’s death.&nbsp; That is the only conclusion with respect to causation that is consistent with the jury’s verdict.</span></p>

The question is whether the Crown has discharged its burden to show that this error, which is not a minor one viewed in the abstract, in fact had no impact on the verdict:&nbsp; <i>R. v.

In my respectful view, the trial judge’s failure to give directions on the offence of attempted murder could not possibly have had any effect on the outcome of this trial, and it may safely be said that this omission occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

The trial judge erred by refusing to allow defence counsel to comment on this in his closing address to the jury.&nbsp; The Court applied the proviso. The conviction, the Court reasoned, showed that the jury must have accepted one witness’s uncorroborated evidence.&nbsp; It followed that depriving defence counsel of the right to comment on the omitted witness could not reasonably be thought to have affected the result.&nbsp; Thus, in applying the proviso in that case, the Court looked to the conclusions necessarily reached by the jury as reflected in their verdict and used those conclusions to assess whether there was any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had the error not been made.</span></p>

Proof of causation made the instructions on attempted murder legally and factually irrelevant to the jury’s deliberations. I would add that there was nothing that emerged during the jury’s deliberations to detract from this view.&nbsp; The jury deliberated for five days and asked some questions, but they did not raise any question about causation.</span></p>

Jackson</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 573, is an example.&nbsp; The trial judge erred by not telling the jury that the accused Davy could be found guilty of manslaughter as a party to the offence even if they convicted his co-accused Jackson of murder. The trial judge in fact instructed the jury that “[a]ll parties to the offence are equally guilty” and expressed the view that it was “unlikely” that Davy could be guilty of manslaughter (pp. 588 and 590).&nbsp; Thus, the trial judge not only failed to tell the jury that Davy could be guilty of manslaughter even if they found Jackson guilty of murder, but, in addition, the judge’s instructions could well have led the jury to believe the opposite.&nbsp; These instructions tainted Davy’s conviction for murder.&nbsp; In those circumstances, it was not an answer to the erroneous instructions to say that the jury had convicted Davy of murder.&nbsp; They had been misdirected on that offence by the judge’s instructions that all parties to the offence are equally guilty (pp. 592-93). The error could not therefore be treated as harmless with respect to the conviction for murder.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [2000] HCA 15, 201 C.L.R. 414; <i>Bullard v. The Queen</i>, [1957] A.C. 635 (P.C.); <i>R. v. Coutts</i>, [2006] UKHL 39, [2006] 4 All E.R. 353. This Court has on at least one occasion referred with approval to this approach:&nbsp; <i>Jackson</i>, at p. 593.&nbsp; However, my respectful view is that the reasoning underlying this approach is inconsistent and faulty and should not be followed, especially when the issue before the jury does not involve the difficult distinction between the mental states for murder and manslaughter.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">To begin, while the results of this line of authority are consistent, the reasoning underlying it is not.&nbsp; One explanation as to why the jury’s finding should not be given weight is that “a jury room might not be a place of undeviating intellectual and logical rigour”: <i>Gilbert</i>, <i>per </i>Callinan J.,<i> </i>at para. 96.&nbsp; Thus, absent knowledge about the possibility of conviction for a lesser offence, the jury may have convicted “out of a reluctance to see the defendant get clean away with what, on any view, was disgraceful conduct”: <i>R. v. Maxwell</i> (1990), 91 Cr. App. R. 61 (H.L.), at p. 68. As Moldaver J.A. put it in his dissenting reasons in the present case, “the palatability of a potential verdict may have played a role in the jury’s decision”: 2010 ONCA 577, 268 O.A.C. 200, at para. 162.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Doherty J.A., writing for a majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case, adopted a version of this reasoning. He held that the error was significant because “a jury’s fact-finding on a specific issue such as causation <u>could be subconsciously influenced</u> by what it is told about the legal consequences of that fact-finding” (para. 94 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; This seems to me to be, in essence, the point that the jury might be reluctant to see the accused “get clean away”.&nbsp; While Doherty J.A. did “not suggest that the jury was in fact influenced by what it was told about the consequences of its fact-finding on the causation issue”, he maintained that “there is sufficient uncertainty as to whether the jury’s fact-finding on the question of causation was tainted by the non-direction on attempted murder” (para. 96).&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Respectfully, this is an elegantly understated way of expressing what to me is an unacceptable proposition: appellate courts should assume that a jury might relax the standard of proof of causation because the alternative would be to let the accused walk.&nbsp; I cannot agree, on such speculative grounds, to set aside a jury verdict of 12 citizens who are presumed to have honoured their oath and who received impeccable legal instructions on the very issue in contention.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">If this reasoning is accepted, where might the risk of this sort of “subconscious” influence stop?&nbsp; Perhaps it could “taint” the jury’s consideration of the issue of identification. After all, if the jury were not sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondents were the perpetrators, a horrible crime might go unpunished. Perhaps the jury “subconsciously” allowed that to influence their assessment of the identification evidence. Might it have “tainted” the jury’s consideration of the accomplice’s role? Did it colour their consideration of the question of intention? This sort of speculation at the jury’s expense has no basis in fact and necessarily imputes to the jurors — and all 12 of them at that — a “subconscious” failure to fulfill their sworn duty.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">A second approach taken in these authorities is simply to assert that the trial judge’s failure to give legal instructions on an available lesser, alternative verdict that should have been left with the jury is an injustice: see, e.g., <i>Coutts</i>,<i> per</i> Lord Hutton, at paras. 56 and 61.&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach is not based on an assumption that the jury may have chosen perhaps subconsciously to ignore the instructions they were given in order to avoid an unpalatable verdict.&nbsp; Respectfully, however, this second line of reasoning is simply the assertion of a conclusion that the omitted instruction gave rise to an injustice.&nbsp; It does not explain why the jury’s unambiguous finding, which, as a matter of law and logic, is untainted by error, cannot be relied on to show, in the particular circumstances, that the omission or misdirection was harmless.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In my respectful view, this sort of reasoning rests on either speculation at the jury’s expense or the simple assertion of a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[57]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">I also am of the view that there is a risk of extending this line of cases which, for the most part, dealt with murder convictions where manslaughter was a live possibility on the evidence at trial but was not left with the jury or was left in an erroneous way.&nbsp; In such cases, there will often be at least some articulable basis to think that a proper charge on manslaughter might have helped the jury to understand the rather subtle but important differences between the mental elements of that offence and murder.&nbsp; Of course, in this case, it cannot be suggested (and was not) that a proper charge on attempted murder could have assisted the jury’s comprehension of the law of causation.&nbsp; Nothing about the legal elements of the offence of attempted murder could possibly have assisted the jury’s understanding of the requirement that the Crown establish causation beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">One is therefore left with the speculative chance of some “subconscious” effect prompted by the jury’s supposed reluctance to acquit the respondents or the simple assertion that failure to give the omitted instruction generally constitutes an injustice. I respectfully cannot accept either approach.&nbsp; The first relies on speculation that in my respectful view is wrong in law, wrong as a matter of policy and insufficiently respectful of the jury’s efforts over five days of deliberations to reach a true verdict. The second approach in these authorities in my respectful view is unsupported by logic or principle.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In short, my view is that the Crown has discharged its burden to show that if the legal error here — the failure to instruct on attempted murder — had not been made, the result would inevitably have been the same. The issue is not whether the evidence of guilt was “overwhelming”.&nbsp; It was not.&nbsp; The issue is whether there was any reasonable possibility that the error could have had any impact on the verdict. The jury’s verdict in the circumstances of this case shows that there was not.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">I would allow the appeal and restore the jury’s verdicts at trial.</span></p>
