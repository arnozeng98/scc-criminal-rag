24.4pt">It is a crime to extort sexual favours.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the extortion provision is located in the Part of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> entitled “Offences Against Rights of Property”,&nbsp; the word “anything” in the provision is not&nbsp; limited to things of a proprietary or pecuniary nature.&nbsp; Headings will never be determinative of legislative intention, but are merely one factor to be taken into account.&nbsp; In this case, the extortion provision’s location in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is outweighed by competing considerations in determining the scope of “anything”.&nbsp; First, the ordinary meaning of “anything” in its immediate context is clear and supports a broad interpretation, which would include sexual favours. Second, an interpretation of “anything” that includes sexual favours is suggested by the purpose and nature of the offence of extortion.&nbsp; That purpose, which&nbsp; can be directly inferred from the wording of the provision, is that extortion criminalizes intimidation and interference with freedom of choice.&nbsp; Given this objective, it would be unreasonable to criminalize extortion of money or property, but not extortion of sexual favours.&nbsp; Third, Parliament could have easily limited the scope of the word “anything” to things of a proprietary or pecuniary nature.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; a number of Canadian courts have found that “anything” includes sexual favours.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">It is unnecessary in this case to decide whether there is consent to sexual activity if it is obtained by threatened exposure of nude photographs.&nbsp; The accused’s conviction of sexually assaulting B. may be affirmed on the basis of an independent sexual assault, wholly apart from his extortionate conduct.&nbsp; B. testified that, during the two- to three-month period in which she went to the accused’s apartment and had sexual intercourse with him in exchange for the negatives, there were at least two incidents in which the accused persisted in sexual activity after she had unambiguously communicated her lack of consent.&nbsp; The trial judge found B. to be a credible witness and this Court is satisfied that the events unfolded as the complainant described them.&nbsp; This evidence supports a conviction of sexual assault.</p>

Such a disposition would be illegal, as it would contravene an established legal principle.&nbsp; Here, there is not a sufficient factual nexus between the extortion and sexual assault convictions to trigger the application of <i>Kienapple</i> in the case of B.&nbsp; The convictions arise out of different factual transactions.&nbsp; Any one of the occasions over the two- to three-month period in which the accused engaged in sexual activity with B. is sufficient to ground the extortion conviction.&nbsp; By contrast, the sexual assault conviction arises from one or two specific occasions in which B. explicitly communicated her lack of consent to sexual contact.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, the meaning of “anything” in the immediate context of “to extort or gain anything” and inducing any person “to do anything or cause anything to be done” is clearly in keeping with the wide, unrestricted dictionary definition, and includes sexual favours.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">Not a great deal of discussion appears in <i>Bird </i>on this wide interpretation of “anything”, the court being content to say that the word is clear and unambiguous and used in this context is of wide unrestricted application.&nbsp; Yet this is not what is normally meant by “extort or gain”.&nbsp; It is true that, in isolation, “anything” can be of the widest meaning, but in the context of “extort or gain”, one might have thought that it referred to something of some tangible proprietary or pecuniary nature.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">I respectfully disagree.&nbsp; I do not believe the authors place sufficient weight on the fact that the meaning of “anything” is further qualified by the words “to do anything or&nbsp; cause anything to be done” at the end of the section.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

McCraw</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at p. 81; <i>R. v. Clemente</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, at pp. 761-62.&nbsp; When threats are coupled with demands, there is an inducement to accede to the demands.&nbsp; This interferes with the victim’s freedom of choice, as the victim may be coerced into doing something he or she would otherwise have chosen not to do.</p>

H. D. Winder, “The Development of Blackmail” (1941), 5 <i>Modern L. Rev</i>. 21, at p. 24.&nbsp; It later came to denote a number of offences in which property or some other advantage was demanded with threats: see G. L. Williams, “Blackmail”, [1954] <i>Crim. L. Rev.</i> 79, at p. 79.&nbsp; In the early stages of its development, the crime of blackmail “seems to have been pretty well coextensive with robbery and attempted robbery, but over the years the definition has been extended to embrace more subtle methods of extortion”: J.&nbsp;C. Smith and B. Hogan, <i>Criminal Law</i> (8th ed.&nbsp; 1996), at p. 618.&nbsp;&nbsp; Extortion was originally a separate common law offence punishing the conduct of public officials who sought personal financial gain under colour of their office.&nbsp; It has since been statutorily expanded in some jurisdictions, such as Canada, to include more familiar forms of blackmail.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The ordinary meaning of “any unwarranted demand” is of similar breadth as “anything” in s. 305.&nbsp; However, the scope of s. 21 is expressly limited by s. 34 of the <i>Theft Act</i>, which states that for the purposes of the <i>Theft Act</i> (and thus for the purpose of s. 21) “‘gain’ and ‘loss’ are to be construed as extending only to gain or loss in money or other property”.&nbsp; The fact that Parliament did not limit s. 305 in this manner is yet another reason in favour of adopting a broad interpretation.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, at p. 584, McIntyre J. held that “wilful blindness arises where a person who has become aware of the need for some inquiry declines to make the inquiry because he does not wish to know the truth.&nbsp; He would prefer to remain ignorant”.&nbsp; More recently in <i>Esau</i>, <i>supra</i>, McLachlin J. described wilful blindness as follows at para. 70:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The term wilful blindness connotes a deliberate avoidance of the facts and circumstances.&nbsp; It is the legal equivalent of turning a blind eye, of not seeing or hearing what is there to hear or see.&nbsp; It is the making of an <u>assumption</u> that the complainant consents without determining whether, <u>as a matter of fact</u>, the complainant consents.&nbsp; Blindness as to the need to obtain consent can never be raised by an accused as a defence.... [Emphasis in original.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In light of the foregoing evidence, I am convinced that the appellant was wilfully blind as to whether the complainant consented.&nbsp; Accordingly, the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent has no air of reality.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

W. (D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; Second, that in the cases of D.A.S. and T.R., the trial judge used language that suggests that he reversed the onus on the burden of proof from the Crown to the appellant.</p>

(D.).&nbsp; </i>At paras. 3-5 he held:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">. . . it is important to ensure that one applies the presumption of innocence to the accused in each of the cases.&nbsp; The obligation is never lifted from the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on each of the counts.&nbsp; It has been pointed out in numerous cases that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is that degree of proof which “convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience that the Crown has proven all the essential elements of the offence”: see <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>. . . .</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">It has been said by a number of trial judges that it is incorrect to approach these cases in terms of whether or not one believes the defence’s evidence or the Crown’s evidence.&nbsp; The correct approach is to ask oneself; even if I do not believe the evidence of the accused, whether or not, viewing the evidence as a whole, I have a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt. . .&nbsp; .</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It is important to review all of the testimony and consider the evidence in its totality in the broader context of the presumption of innocence and the requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to finally reach a decision on each count.</p>

(D.)</i> while dealing with each count, this does not mean that he erred.&nbsp; I agree with Green J.A. who held at pp. 325-26:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">. . . the trial judge, near the beginning of his reasons for judgment, when dealing with general principles, specifically referred to and properly stated, the effect of <i>R. v. D. W. </i>as it affects the application of the principle of reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility.&nbsp; The fact that he did not repeat the admonition each time as he dealt with the facts of each count does not necessarily mean that he failed to consider or apply the principle in each case.&nbsp; Just because a judge, after considering the evidence, decides to accept a complainant’s version of events over that of an accused’s does not mean he has fallen into the trap which <i>R. v. D. W. </i>warns against.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It is not sufficient to “cherry pick” certain infelicitous phrases or sentences without enquiring as to whether the literal meaning was effectively neutralized by other passages.&nbsp; This is especially true in the case of a judge sitting alone where other comments made by him or her may make it perfectly clear that he or she did not misapprehend the import of the legal principles involved.&nbsp; As McLachlin J. said in [<i>R. v. B. (C.R.)</i>, [1990] 1<i> </i>S.C.R. 717, at p. 737]: “[t]he fact that a trial judge misstates himself at one point should not vitiate his ruling if the preponderance of what was said shows that the proper test was applied and if the decision can be justified on the evidence.”</p>
