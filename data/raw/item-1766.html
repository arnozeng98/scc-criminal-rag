 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A conditional sentence should be distinguished from probationary measures.&nbsp; Probation is primarily a rehabilitative sentencing tool.&nbsp; By contrast, Parliament intended conditional sentences to include both punitive and rehabilitative aspects.&nbsp; Therefore, conditional sentences should generally include punitive conditions that are restrictive of the offender's liberty.&nbsp; Conditions such as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The requirement in s. 742.1(<i>a</i>) that the judge impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years does not require the judge to first impose a sentence of imprisonment of a fixed duration before considering whether that sentence can be served in the community.&nbsp; Although this approach is suggested by the text of s. 742.1(<i>a</i>), it is unrealistic and could lead to unfit sentences in some cases.&nbsp; Instead, a purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(<i>a</i>) should be adopted.&nbsp; In a preliminary determination, the sentencing judge should reject a penitentiary term and probationary measures as inappropriate.&nbsp; Having determined that the appropriate range of sentence is a term of imprisonment of less than two years, the judge should then consider whether it is appropriate for the offender to serve his or her sentence in the community.&nbsp; As a corollary of the purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(<i>a</i>), a conditional sentence need not be of equivalent duration to the sentence of incarceration that would otherwise have been imposed.&nbsp; The sole requirement is that the duration and conditions of a conditional sentence make for a just and appropriate sentence.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Once the prerequisites of s. 742.1 are satisfied, the judge should give serious consideration to the possibility of a conditional sentence in all cases by examining whether a conditional sentence is consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.&nbsp; This follows from Parliament‚Äôs clear message to the judiciary to reduce the use of incarceration as a sanction. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and deterrence.&nbsp; As a general matter, the more serious the offence, the longer and more onerous the conditional sentence should be.&nbsp; There may be some circumstances, however, where the need for denunciation or deterrence is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society's condemnation of the offender's conduct or to deter similar conduct in the future.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In this case the sentencing judge considered that a term of imprisonment of 18 months was appropriate and declined to permit the accused to serve his term in the community.&nbsp; She found that, while the accused would not endanger the safety of the community by serving a conditional sentence, such a sentence would not be in conformity with the objectives of s. 718.&nbsp; In her view, even if incarceration was not necessary to deter the accused from similar future conduct or necessary for his rehabilitation, incarceration was necessary to send a strong message to denounce the accused‚Äôs conduct and to deter others from engaging in similar conduct.&nbsp; While the sentencing judge seems to have proceeded according to a rigid two-step process, in deviation from the approach set out in these reasons, an 18-month sentence of incarceration was not demonstrably unfit for these offences and this offender.&nbsp; The offences here were very serious, and had resulted in a death and in severe bodily harm.&nbsp; Moreover, dangerous driving and impaired driving may be offences for which harsh sentences plausibly provide general deterrence.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the sentencing judge had given undue weight to the objective of denunciation.&nbsp; Absent evidence that the sentence was demonstrably unfit, the Court of Appeal should not have interfered to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge.&nbsp; The sentencing judge did not commit a reversible error in principle and she appropriately considered all the relevant factors.&nbsp; Accordingly, the 18-month sentence of incarceration imposed by her should be restored.&nbsp; Since the accused has already served the conditional sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal in its entirety, and the Crown stated in oral argument that it was not seeking any further punishment, the service of the sentence of incarceration should be stayed.</span></p>

Overincarceration is a long‚Äëstanding problem that has been many times publicly acknowledged but never addressed in a systematic manner by Parliament. In recent years, compared to other countries, sentences of imprisonment in Canada have increased at an alarming rate. <u>The 1996 sentencing reforms embodied in Part XXIII, and s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) in particular, must be understood as a reaction to the overuse of prison as a sanction, and must accordingly be given appropriate force as remedial provisions.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

Pursuant to s. 733.1(1), breach of probation constitutes a new offence, punishable by up to two years&nbsp; imprisonment, while a breach of condition does not constitute a new offence <i>per se</i>.&nbsp; The maximum penalties are also different.&nbsp; In the case of a breach of probation, the offender is subject to the revocation of the probation order and can be sentenced for the original offence (in cases where a suspended sentence was rendered): see s. 732.2(5).&nbsp; By contrast, in the case of breaches of conditional sentences,&nbsp; the maximum punishment available is incarceration for the time remaining of the original sentence (s. 742.6(9)).&nbsp; Presumably, if a conditional sentence is more onerous than probation, the consequences of breaching a condition should be more onerous as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Minister of Employment and Immigration</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 856, at pp. 863-64; <i>Gravel v. City of St-L√©onard</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 660, at p. 669; <i>Pfizer Co. v.

Sargeant</i> (1974), 60 Cr.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

As Iacobucci J. explained in <i>Shropshire</i>, at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime. But in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both <i>Shropshire</i> and this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling. A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender. A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our criminal justice system. <u>Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the offender's crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be "just and appropriate" for the protection of that community. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.</u>&nbsp; The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">2. A conditional sentence should be distinguished from probationary measures.&nbsp; Probation is primarily a rehabilitative sentencing tool.&nbsp; By contrast, Parliament intended conditional sentences to include both punitive and rehabilitative aspects.&nbsp; Therefore, conditional sentences should generally include punitive conditions that are restrictive of the offender's liberty.&nbsp; Conditions such as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The requirement in s. 742.1(<i>a</i>) that the judge impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years does not require the judge to first impose a sentence of imprisonment of a fixed duration before considering whether that sentence can be served in the community.&nbsp; Although this approach is suggested by the text of s. 742.1(<i>a</i>), it is unrealistic and could lead to unfit sentences in some cases.&nbsp; Instead, a purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(<i>a</i>) should be adopted.&nbsp; In a preliminary determination, the sentencing judge should reject a penitentiary term and probationary measures as inappropriate.&nbsp; Having determined that the appropriate range of sentence is a term of imprisonment of less than two years, the judge should then consider whether it is appropriate for the offender to serve his or her sentence in the community.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">6.&nbsp; The requirement in s. 742.1(<i>b</i>) that the judge be satisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving his or her sentence in the community is a condition precedent to the imposition of a conditional sentence, and not the primary consideration in determining whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.&nbsp; In making this determination, the judge should consider the risk posed by the specific offender, not the broader risk of whether the imposition of a conditional sentence would endanger the safety of the community by providing insufficient general deterrence or undermining general respect for the law.&nbsp; Two factors should be taken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and (2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence.&nbsp; A consideration of the risk posed by the offender should include the risk of any criminal activity, and not be limited solely to the risk of physical or psychological harm to individuals.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Once the prerequisites of s. 742.1 are satisfied, the judge should give serious consideration to the possibility of a conditional sentence in all cases by examining whether a conditional sentence is consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.&nbsp; This follows from Parliament‚Äôs clear message to the judiciary to reduce the use of incarceration as a sanction.</p>

A conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and deterrence.&nbsp; As a general matter, the more serious the offence, the longer and more onerous the conditional sentence should be.&nbsp; There may be some circumstances, however, where the need for denunciation or deterrence is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society's condemnation of the offender's conduct or to deter similar conduct in the future.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

line-height:24.4pt">130<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I hasten to add that these comments should not be taken as a directive that conditional sentences can never be imposed for offences such as dangerous driving or impaired driving.&nbsp; In fact, were I a trial judge, I might have found that a conditional sentence would have been appropriate in this case.&nbsp; The respondent is still very young, he had no prior record and no convictions since the accident, he seems completely rehabilitated, he wants to go back to school, he has already suffered a lot by causing the death of a friend and was himself in a coma for some time.&nbsp; To make sure that the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence would have been sufficiently addressed, I might have imposed conditions such as house arrest and a community service order requiring the offender to speak to designated groups about the consequences of dangerous driving, as was the case in <i>Parker</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 239,&nbsp; and <i>R</i>. <i>v.</i> <i>Hollinsky</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 472 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp;</p>

R.A.R.</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 163, 2000 SCC 8, at paras. 20-21), in my opinion it erred in holding that the sentencing judge had given undue weight to the objective of denunciation.&nbsp; I see no ground for the Court of Appeal‚Äôs intervention.</p>
