 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt.&nbsp; On appeal, the accused argued that the trial judge erred by placing too much emphasis on the complainant’s post‑offence demeanour, in his approach to assessing credibility and in relying on the injury to his finger as corroborative evidence.&nbsp; He moved to introduce as fresh evidence the report of a forensic dentist, who had concluded that the mark on his finger was <i>not</i> the result of a bite mark, arguing that this fresh evidence strongly undermined the trial judge’s reasons and verdict.&nbsp; A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the application as well as the other grounds of the appeal. &nbsp;The main issue is whether or not the application to introduce fresh evidence should be allowed.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="CitationCar"><span style="color:windowtext">Held</span></span><span class="CitationCar"><span style="color:windowtext;font-style:normal"> (Deschamps and Rothstein&nbsp;JJ. dissenting):</span></span>&nbsp; The appeal should be allowed.&nbsp; The fresh evidence should be admitted, the convictions set aside and a new trial ordered.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, include the requirements that the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial and that the fresh evidence must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.&nbsp; Although the accused essentially conceded that he failed to meet the due diligence criterion, as this evidence obviously could have been adduced at trial, this factor should not trump the other <i>Palmer </i>criteria, particularly in circumstances such as here where trial counsel’s strategy was not unreasonable given the nature of the anticipated Crown evidence. &nbsp;Neither the Crown nor the defence had contemplated calling expert evidence about the mark on the accused’s finger.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed expert evidence could reasonably be expected to have affected the result.&nbsp; The trial judge viewed this case as a close one and, while he found the complainant to be credible, he also commented favourably on the accused’s testimony.&nbsp; In ultimately rejecting the accused’s testimony, he twice mentioned the injury to the accused finger, clearly regarding it as corroborative.&nbsp; The fresh evidence reveals that reliance on this evidence is misplaced and, if accepted, would not only vitiate one of the bases for the trial judge’s reliance on the complainant’s testimony and his rejection of the appellant’s version of events but also would arguably undermine the complainant’s credibility.&nbsp; While the officer was qualified to describe the injury he saw, his evidence arguably exceeded the proper boundaries of lay opinion evidence.&nbsp; In light of the expert’s direct refutation of the officer’s opinion, the prejudicial effect of its erroneous admission is brought into sharp focus.&nbsp; When considered in the context of the other evidence at trial and the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, the fresh evidence was sufficiently cogent that it could reasonably be expected to have affected the verdict.&nbsp; It was not necessary to address the other grounds of appeal.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</span></i><span style="line-height:200%"> Deschamps and Rothstein&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; Although the due diligence criterion should not trump the other <i>Palmer</i> criteria, neither should it be ignored.&nbsp; Lack of due diligence at trial is a consideration weighing against reception of the new evidence on appeal.</span></p>

Several other factors also supported the complainant’s version of events and the rejection of that of the accused:&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;the evidence of her post event demeanour; (ii)&nbsp;the evidence of the condition of the home and the items located in it; (iii)&nbsp;the evidence relating to the existence of the dull knife; (iv)&nbsp;the manner in which the accused described his interaction and control over the complainant during the sexual activity; and (v)&nbsp;the general internal and external logic and consistency of the complainant’s version as opposed to the accused’s version of events.&nbsp; An examination of the trial judge’s reasons, and the factors that he considered in coming to the conclusion that the accused’s evidence was “not capable of belief” all demonstrate the minor nature of the biting evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.A. testified that J.A.A. sexually assaulted her repeatedly, at one point showing her a knife and threatening to kill himself and her as well.&nbsp; She also testified that she bit one of his fingers during the assault “very hard”, “as hard as I could”. When the events ended, S.A. drove immediately to a friend’s home and the police were called.&nbsp; The neighbour and one of the police officers testified that the complainant was crying, distraught and appeared terrified.&nbsp; A police officer who interviewed J.A.A. that afternoon testified that he saw a cut that looked like a bite mark on one of J.A.A.’s fingers.&nbsp; The officer then explained in more detail why he thought it was a tooth mark.&nbsp; Defence counsel did not object to the officer’s opinion evidence but cross-examined him on his lack of expertise in this area and on the failure to retain an expert on dental marks.&nbsp; J.A.A. denied sexually assaulting the complainant.&nbsp; He provided considerable detail about the events in question but testified that the sexual relations were consensual. He also denied that S.A. bit him at any time.</p>

J.)).&nbsp; He also found no reason to reject J.A.A.’s testimony, when taken in isolation.&nbsp; However, the trial judge was ultimately satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of J.A.A.’s guilt based on the complainant’s evidence, her post-event demeanour, the injury to J.A.A.’s finger, photographs taken of the home when investigated by the police which were consistent with her testimony as to where various items of clothing were left, the existence of the knife and the general internal and external logic and consistency of her description of the events.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.A.A. appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeal for Ontario on the grounds that the trial judge improperly rejected his evidence without any basis or foundation and erred in law in his approach to assessing credibility.&nbsp; J.A.A. contended that the trial judge placed too much emphasis on the post-event demeanour of the complainant as a factor in conviction.&nbsp; In particular, he argued that evidence of her emotional reaction when she saw him two days after the events as he was escorted by police to the house to gather his personal belongings was of no probative value and should not have been admitted.&nbsp; J.A.A. also argued that the trial judge erred in relying on the injury to his finger as corroborative evidence, as the officer’s lay opinion evidence that it was a bite mark was inadmissible.&nbsp; On this latter point, J.A.A. moved to introduce as fresh evidence the report of Dr. Wood, a forensic dentist, who concluded that the mark on his finger was <i>not</i> the result of a bite mark.&nbsp; In addition, Dr. Wood concluded that, based on the complainant’s testimony, he would have expected to find evidence of a bite mark.&nbsp; J.A.A. argued that this fresh evidence strongly undermined the trial judge’s reasons and verdict.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed J.A.A.’s application to introduce fresh evidence, holding that Dr. Wood’s evidence, even if believed, could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result (2010 ONCA 491, 261 C.C.C. (3d) 125).&nbsp; The majority added that the due diligence criterion, which the appellant essentially conceded he could not meet, “cannot be ignored or wished away” as it plays an important role in the administration of criminal justice (para. 34).&nbsp; The majority also rejected the other grounds of appeal and upheld the convictions.&nbsp; Winkler C.J.O., dissenting, would have allowed the application to introduce fresh evidence.&nbsp; He would also have ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge improperly admitted lay opinion evidence on the bite mark and demeanour evidence of the complainant, and misdirected himself as to the manner in which he applied the criminal onus of proof.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the application to introduce fresh evidence.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, are well known:&nbsp; (1) the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial; (2) the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial; (3) the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief; and (4) it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant essentially concedes that he cannot meet the due diligence criterion, as this evidence obviously could have been adduced at trial.&nbsp; He submits, however, that this factor should not be determinative.&nbsp; Trial counsel explained in an affidavit that he did not consider retaining any kind of expert to examine the photos of the mark on his client’s finger, as it seemed to him that “the mark was a minor generic scratch” which in fact appeared inconsistent with the complainant’s testimony.&nbsp; Further, the Crown did not contemplate calling expert evidence about the mark.&nbsp; I agree that the due diligence criterion should not trump the other <i>Palmer </i>criteria, particularly in circumstances such as here where trial counsel’s strategy was not unreasonable given the nature of the anticipated Crown evidence.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that criteria (2) and (3) are met:&nbsp; Dr. Wood’s report is relevant and reasonably capable of belief.&nbsp; Dr. Wood’s credentials are impressive; indeed, after cross-examining him and consulting another expert, the Crown presented no evidence in response to the fresh evidence.&nbsp; The application therefore turns on the final criterion.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I respectfully disagree with the majority below that Dr. Wood’s evidence could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result.&nbsp; As I read the trial judge’s reasons, he viewed this case as a close one.&nbsp; While he found the complainant credible, he also commented favourably on the appellant’s testimony.&nbsp; After instructing himself on the appropriate standard of proof, the trial judge explained how he resolved the credibility issue, stating as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation1" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the evidence of the complainant compelling, straightforward, credible, and supported by her demeanour after she left the house, in her contact with her neighbour, and shortly after when her husband attended to retrieve his clothing; and as well at the hospital and the Mountain Station when giving her initial statements.&nbsp; <u>Her evidence was also supported by the injury to the accused’s finger</u>, and the general condition of the home when investigated by the police; including the location of various items of clothing, and the existence of the dull knife.</p>
 <p class="Citation1" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused’s evidence was articulate, responsive to the questions asked, and generally unshaken in cross-examination.&nbsp; Taken in isolation, there was little in the substance of his evidence, or in the manner in which it was given, that suggested it was untrue.</p>

 <p class="Citation1" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stacked beside [S.A.’s] evidence, the evidence of the complainant’s demeanour after the attack, <u>the evidence of injury to the accused’s finger</u>, their evidence with regard to the accused’s possession of the knife, and their shared knowledge that the knife was dull, the manner in which the accused described his interaction with the complainant during the event, and the manner in which he described his control of her, all of which I find supportive of the complainant’s evidence, and the general internal and external logic and consistency of the complainant’s description of the events, as opposed to the accused’s evidence as outlined in the Crown’s submissions, I find the accused’s evidence is not capable of belief.</p>
 <p class="Citation1CxSpLast" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering all of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence of sexual assault and sexual assault with a weapon. [Emphasis added; paras. 86-90.]</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel at trial urged the trial judge to accept the officer’s testimony that the injury to J.A.A.’s finger was a bite mark and argued that this evidence corroborated S.A.’s version of events.&nbsp; The Crown now seeks to downplay the importance of the bite mark evidence.&nbsp; However, in ultimately rejecting J.A.A.’s testimony, the trial judge twice mentioned the injury to J.A.A.’s finger, clearly regarding it as corroborative.&nbsp; The fresh evidence now reveals that reliance on this evidence is misplaced.&nbsp; Dr. Wood’s evidence, if accepted, not only vitiates one of the bases for the trial judge’s reliance on the complainant’s testimony and his rejection of the appellant’s version of events, but it also arguably undermines the credibility of S.A.’s testimony that she bit down on J.A.A.’s finger “as hard as [she] could”.&nbsp; While the officer was qualified to describe the injury he saw, his evidence arguably exceeded the proper boundaries of lay opinion evidence.&nbsp; As the appellant fairly concedes in his factum, “If the opinion stood unchallenged, the error may have been of little consequence.”&nbsp; However, in light of Dr. Wood’s direct refutation of the officer’s opinion, “the prejudicial effect of its erroneous admission is brought into sharp focus” (A.F., at para. 43).&nbsp; It is not necessary to decide on this application to what extent the officer’s testimony may have been inadmissible.&nbsp; For our purposes, it suffices to say that it appears to have been clearly wrong.&nbsp; Thus, the trial judge’s reliance on this item of evidence is of much concern.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apparent, and understandable, from the trial judge’s reasons that he looked closely at any item of physical evidence that could assist him in determining the credibility issue.&nbsp; For example, I note that in another part of his reasons, he referred to a photograph showing a possible scratch in the accused’s pubic area, commenting that the mark was not directly on the penis.&nbsp; As the complainant had testified that she scratched J.A.A.’s penis, the trial judge stated, “It is troubling to me, that the officers who were there when the photograph was taken, saw no indication of an injury” on the penis (para. 80).&nbsp; He therefore resolved that he would treat this item of evidence as essentially neutral.</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When considered in the context of the other evidence at trial and the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, I agree with Winkler C.J.O. that Dr. Wood’s evidence “is sufficiently cogent that it could reasonably be expected to have affected the verdict” (para. 80).</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my respectful view, it would be unsafe to uphold the convictions on the strength of the other factors which the trial judge considered supportive of his conclusion.&nbsp; The majority in the Court of Appeal found two of these factors to be “particularly powerful”:&nbsp; “the complainant’s physical and emotional state in the minutes and hours after the event” and “the logic of the complainant’s testimony”, as opposed to the appellant’s version of consensual sex (para. 38).&nbsp; I agree with counsel for the appellant that it would be dangerous for this Court to uphold the convictions and thus resolve the credibility issue in this case on the strength of demeanour evidence, or on the basis that one party’s version was less plausible than the other’s. While one may reasonably view the appellant’s version of consensual sex implausible in the circumstances outlined by the majority (para. 38), counsel aptly points out that the same could be said about the complainant’s version.&nbsp; It also seems implausible that the appellant, who had never been depressed, violent, or aggressive in the 19 years the parties spent together, suddenly turned into the suicidal, violent rapist described by the complainant.&nbsp; <span style="color:black">J.A.A. adamantly denied ever having had suicidal thoughts, stating in response to the complainant’s testimony on the subject that he did not “even know what she’s talking about” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 107).&nbsp; </span>In this regard, I find the trial judge’s observations at the time of sentencing noteworthy.&nbsp; He stated the following:</p>
 <p class="Citation1" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the character letters and the pre-sentence report describe a responsible father with a good work history, no criminal record or prior involvement with the law, and no history whatsoever of violence either towards intimate partners or strangers.</p>
 <p class="Citation1" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparing the offender, who I have found committed these offences, with the person described in the reference letters and the pre-sentence report, I can only come to the conclusion that these offences are entirely out of character for this accused, and on the date in question, he snapped when he committed these most grievous offences.&nbsp; [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 34-35]</p>
 <p class="ReasonsNumbering-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Winkler C.J.O. concluded, the weight the fresh evidence ought to be given will ultimately be “a question for a trier of fact, after cross-examination and in the context of the other evidence that may be adduced” at the new trial (para. 81).</p>
