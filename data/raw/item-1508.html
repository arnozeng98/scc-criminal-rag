 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This case, however, pertained only to arrests with a warrant.&nbsp; In <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Section 495(1)(<i>a</i>) sets out the subjective requirement for a warrantless arrest: the peace officer himself or herself must believe reasonable grounds exist.&nbsp; An objective requirement was added in <i>R. v.

Rep. 91a, 77 E.R. 194, and has been illustrated more recently by cases such as <i>Colet v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2, which held that the police entered Colet’s home, a rudimentary shelter, illegally since they did not have explicit authority to search for weapons, but only to seize them.&nbsp; Indeed, the existing legal protection of the security of the home was the basis for the dissenting opinion of La Forest J. in <i>Landry</i>, <i>supra</i>, which contained an extensive analysis of doctrine that concluded warrantless arrests in dwelling houses were illegal; see also Graham Parker, “Developments in Criminal Law: The 1985-86 Term” (1987), 9 <i>Sup.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In my view the interests protected by s. 8 are of a wider ambit than those enunciated in <i>Entick v. Carrington</i> [(1765), 19 St. Tr. 1029, 1 Wils. K.B. 275; a common law case on searches and trespass].&nbsp; Section 8 is an entrenched constitutional provision.&nbsp; It is not therefore vulnerable to encroachment by legislative enactments in the same way as common law protections.&nbsp; There is, further, nothing in the language of the section to restrict it to the protection of property or to associate it with the law of trespass.&nbsp; It guarantees a broad and general right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The shift in emphasis in the law of searches from trespass and basic property rights to the reasonableness of the search had a significant effect on the disposition of <i>Hunter</i>.&nbsp; In that case, there were provisions in the <i>Combines Investigation Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23, which permitted searches and seizures on the authority of the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme Court held that searches and seizures may only be undertaken after authorization from an independent judicial body, which has considered the reasonableness of the proposed search and seizure, has been granted.&nbsp; Dickson J. stated at p. 160:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">If the issue to be resolved in assessing the constitutionality of searches under [the <i>Combines Investigation Act</i>] was <u>in fact</u> the governmental interest in carrying out a given search outweighed that of the individual in resisting the governmental intrusion upon his privacy, then it would be appropriate to determine the balance of the competing interests <u>after</u> the search had been conducted.&nbsp; Such a <i>post facto</i> analysis would, however, be seriously at odds with the purpose of s. 8.&nbsp; That purpose is, as I have said, to protect individuals from unjustified state intrusions upon their privacy.&nbsp; That purpose requires a means of <u>preventing</u> unjustified searches before they happen, not simply of determining, after the fact, whether they ought to have occurred in the first place.&nbsp; This, in my view, can only be accomplished by a system of <u>prior authorization</u>, not one of subsequent validation.

Langlois</i>, <i>supra</i>, is considered.&nbsp; <i>Cloutier</i> held that a search incidental to a lawful arrest does not violate s. 8.&nbsp; Putting this proposition together with the proposition that a warrantless arrest in a dwelling house is legal may lead to the conclusion that a warrantless search of a dwelling house is legal so long as it is accompanied by a lawful arrest.&nbsp; Such a conclusion is clearly at odds with<i> Hunter</i>, which held that warrantless searches are <i>prima facie</i> unreasonable.&nbsp; I conclude that generally a warrant is required to make an arrest in a dwelling house.</p>

Macooh</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 802.&nbsp; In <i>Macooh</i>, a police officer was in hot pursuit of a person he had seen drive through several stop signs when the person sought refuge in a private apartment.&nbsp; The officer announced his presence and eventually entered the apartment without permission and arrested the person.&nbsp; There was a question whether <i>Landry</i> would apply in <i>Macooh</i> given that the suspect was sought pursuant to an offence that was not indictable, but this Court held that the officer was acting under the well-established common law power of the police to enter private premises to make an arrest in hot pursuit.&nbsp; The policy behind such a rule is captured by the following passage from the dissent of La Forest J. in <i>Landry</i>, at p. 179, cited with approval by this Court in <i>Macooh</i>:</p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">As has been seen the common law sets a high value on the security and privacy of the home.&nbsp; The situations where it permitted entry by police without the consent of the owner or occupier were all demonstrably compelling.&nbsp; For example, entry to prevent murder is obviously justified. So too is entry on hot pursuit.&nbsp; Apart from the obvious practicality of that approach, in the case of hot pursuit the police officer is himself cognizant of the facts justifying entry; he acts on the basis of personal knowledge.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In cases of hot pursuit, society’s interest in effective law enforcement takes precedence over the privacy interest and the police may enter a dwelling to make an arrest without a warrant.&nbsp; However, the additional burden on the police to obtain a warrant before forcibly entering a private dwelling to arrest, while not justified in a case of hot pursuit, is, in general, well worth the additional protection to the privacy interest in dwelling houses that it brings. I leave for another day the question of whether exigent circumstances other than hot pursuit may justify a warrantless entry in order to arrest.&nbsp; I do not agree with my colleague L’Heureux-Dubé J. that exigent circumstances generally <u>necessarily</u> justify a warrantless entry -- in my view, it is an open question.&nbsp; As with other matters in her reasons, I note that in reaching her conclusion she cites at paras. 153-54 a <u>dissenting</u> opinion: <i>R. v. Silveira</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297, <i>per</i> L’Heureux-Dubé&nbsp;J.</p>

Fontana (<i>The Law of Search and Seizure in Canada</i> (3rd ed. 1992), at pp. 786-89), exigent circumstances arise usually where immediate action is required for the safety of the police or to secure and protect evidence of a crime. With respect to safety concerns, in my view, it was not apparent that the safety of the police or the community was in such jeopardy that there were exigent circumstances in the present case.&nbsp; The situation was the same as in any case after a serious crime has been committed and the perpetrator has not been apprehended.&nbsp; In any event, even if they existed, safety concerns could not justify the warrantless entry into the trailer in the present case.&nbsp; A simple watch of the trailer in which the police were told the appellant was sleeping, not a warrantless entry, would have sufficiently addressed any safety concerns involving the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to concern about the potential destruction of evidence, at the time the police entered the trailer, they had no knowledge of evidence that might be destroyed; at best, they had a suspicion that the appellant was involved in the murder.&nbsp; Simply because the hunch may have turned out to be justified does not legitimize the actions of the police at the time they entered the trailer.&nbsp; As I stated in <i>R. v. Kokesch</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 3, at p. 29, “[i]t should not be forgotten that <i>ex post facto</i> justification of searches by their results is precisely what the <i>Hunter</i> standards were designed to prevent”.&nbsp;</p>

As the Crown did not attempt to prove that the statements would have been made even in the absence of a violation of s. 10(<i>b</i>) (see <i>Harper</i>, <i>supra</i>, where such proof was tendered), I conclude that the statements were conscriptive and would not have been obtained without breaching the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Thus, following the <i>Stillman</i> analysis, the statements were not “discoverable”.&nbsp; The admission of the statements therefore would affect the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; Given that no exceptional circumstances exist in this case, the admission of the conscriptive, non-discoverable statements would render the trial unfair; thus the statements are inadmissible under s. 24(2).</p>

Burlingham</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, confirmed that evidence may be considered conscriptive if it was found as the result of other conscriptive evidence, typically a statement.&nbsp; A characterization of such evidence as conscriptive, “derivative evidence” is appropriate where the initial conscriptive evidence is a <u>necessary</u> cause of the obtention of the derivative evidence.&nbsp; In the present case, the statements given to the police at Williams Lake did not indicate the location of the cigarettes; thus the statements could not even have been a <u>sufficient</u> cause for obtaining the cigarettes.&nbsp; While the statements might, if admissible, have added evidentiary significance to the cigarettes, the statements were not related to the discovery and seizure of the evidence; thus the cigarettes are not conscriptive, derivative evidence.&nbsp; Their admission would not affect trial fairness.</p>

Genest</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 59, for example, the Court held that a search in violation of well-known common law principles was performed in bad faith.&nbsp; In the instant case, the police did not even have subjective belief in reasonable and probable grounds for the appellant’s arrest prior to their warrantless, forced entry into his dwelling house where he was sleeping.&nbsp; Aside from the impact of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> on the requirements for warrantless arrests in dwelling houses, the absence of subjective belief in reasonable grounds indicated that the police could not have lawfully arrested the appellant under s. 495 of the <i>Code</i> even had he been in a public place.&nbsp; That they flagrantly disobeyed the law of warrantless arrests in dwelling houses as set out in <i>Landry</i> certainly renders the more serious the violation which directly led to the taking of the bloody shirt, and indirectly led to the taking of the shoes, cigarettes and money.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In the present case, the police did not have subjective grounds to arrest, and thus the requirements for a warrantless arrest in a dwelling house set out in <i>Landry</i> were not met.&nbsp; Indeed, the statutory requirements to make a warrantless arrest in <u>any</u> location were not met.&nbsp; In these circumstances, as in <i>Kokesch</i>, the police either knew they were trespassing, or they ought to have known.&nbsp; The police could not be held to have acted in good faith and the trial judge erred in this respect.</p>

Madrigga himself did not believe that there were reasonable grounds to arrest the appellant.&nbsp; In my view, the absence of a subjective belief that a necessary element of a lawful entry and arrest was present is a strong suggestion of bad faith.</p>

At that time they would have observed the bloodstains on him, unless he had destroyed that evidence.”&nbsp; The respondent assumes that the appellant would walk out in broad daylight with bloodstains on his shirt.&nbsp; In my view, this suggestion is unrealistic.&nbsp; Moreover, the appellant need not have destroyed the evidence on the shirt in order to avoid displaying it in public, but simply could have stored the shirt in the trailer.&nbsp; In any event, the availability of alternative constitutional means to discover the shirt does not mitigate the seriousness of the violation even if such means did exist.&nbsp; As Lamer J. (as he then was) stated in <i>Collins</i>,<i> supra</i>, at p. 285, “the availability of other investigatory techniques and the fact that the evidence could have been obtained without the violation of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> tend to render the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> violation more serious”.&nbsp; If other techniques were indeed available, it is demonstrative of bad faith and is particularly serious that the police chose to violate the appellant’s rights.</p>

Madrigga’s belief that the owner of the trailer had given his tacit consent to enter the trailer.&nbsp; In my view, this submission is unacceptable.&nbsp; First, the owner of the trailer did not consent to the search, but rather did not object when the police stated that they were going to “check it out” at the trailer.&nbsp; An inference of consent to a warrantless, forcible entry from Russell’s silence is dubious.&nbsp; However, even accepting that Russell had consented, this would not have justified the search nor should it mitigate the seriousness of the violation entailed by the search.&nbsp; <i>Hunter</i>, <i>supra</i>, was clear that an ownership interest is unnecessary in invoking s. 8; what is required is a reasonable expectation of privacy.&nbsp; It would be inconsistent with this emphasis on the expectation of privacy to mitigate the seriousness of the violation based on the consent of the owner of the premises rather than the person with the profound expectation of privacy associated with his dwelling house.&nbsp;</p>

Madrigga walked into the trailer, shook the appellant’s leg and said, “Wake up, police.&nbsp; I want to talk to you.”&nbsp; The officer asked the appellant to step to the entrance because the trailer was dark and he could not see well.&nbsp; They moved toward the door, and the officer saw that the appellant’s shirt was splattered with blood.&nbsp; Sgt.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The reasoning of Traynor J. contemplates the situation where an officer has probable cause to arrest the suspect but postpones his or her decision to arrest the suspect. The officer, thus, avoids making an actual arrest, if the search proves that his or her belief that there was probable cause was erroneous. In my view, it may also very well be that a police officer, notwithstanding that he or she has reasonable and probable grounds upon which to make an arrest, may decide that, if the search does not disclose evidence of the offence, there would be no chance of obtaining a conviction. Hence, the officer may decide not to proceed further by making an arrest.</p>

Madrigga stated: “Wake up, it’s the police.&nbsp; I want to talk to you.”&nbsp; While this is not the most complete notice of purpose imaginable, I do not believe this requirement was ever intended to compel the police to make complex legal statements: <i>R. v. Dupuis </i>(1994), 162 A.R. 197 (C.A.), at p. 199. In this light, I agree with the comments of Hill J. in <i>R. v. Anderson</i> (1996), 49 C.R. (4th) 305 (Ont. Gen.

LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment</i> (3rd ed. 1996), vol. 3, at p.&nbsp;271, has noted that the courts should recognize a distinction between a “planned” arrest and one which is the product of an “in the field” investigation.&nbsp; Indeed, he believes, at pp.&nbsp;271-74,&nbsp; that this should be the defining criterion in making a determination as to whether exigent circumstances are present in a given case: </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Although it is not readily apparent how a more workable but yet fair warrantless entry standard could best be expressed, it would seem that a solution is most likely to be found by distinguishing the truly “planned” arrest from the arrest which is made in the course of an ongoing investigation in the field.&nbsp; A “planned” arrest is one which is made after a criminal investigation has been fully completed at another location and the police make a deliberate decision to go to a certain place, either the arrestee’s home or some other premises where he is believed to be in order to take him into custody....&nbsp; Courts have understandably been reluctant to accept police claims of exigent circumstances in these situations, for it ordinarily appears that whatever exigencies thereafter arose were foreseeable at the time the arrest decision was made, when a warrant could have readily been obtained.&nbsp; In the “planned” arrest situation, then, the only exception to any existing warrant requirement would be the presence of exigent circumstances prior to the time the officers went out into the field for the purpose of making the arrest.</span></p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt"><u><span lang="EN-GB">On the other hand, when the occasion for arrest arises while the police are already out in the field investigating the prior or ongoing conduct which is the basis for the arrest, there should be a far greater reluctance to fault the police for not having an arrest warrant.&nbsp; Here, the presumption should be in favor of a warrantless arrest rather than against it, as the probabilities are high that it is not feasible for the police to delay the arrest while one of their number leaves the area, finds a magistrate and obtains a warrant, and then returns with it</span></u><span lang="EN-GB">.

The second branch of the argument deals with the caution itself, which was given a few minutes later after the appellant was arrested.&nbsp; The appellant asserts that the caution fell short of the standard mandated by this Court in the case of <i>Bartle</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; In my view, neither of these arguments possesses any merit.</span></p>

The caution was given at the first reasonable opportunity.&nbsp; The delay in this case between the time Sgt. Madrigga grabbed the appellant’s leg to wake him up and the time he was read his right to counsel was no more than a few minutes.&nbsp; It is inconceivable that a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breach could be said to have occurred as the result of this short delay alone.&nbsp; I note in passing that a very similar situation occurred in the case of <i>R. v. Manninen</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233<i>.</i>&nbsp; In that case, the accused was detained by two officers for approximately five minutes before being formally arrested and given his right to counsel.&nbsp; Despite concluding that there had been a s.10(<i>b</i>) violation owing to other irregularities, this Court found that there was nothing wrong with a short delay prior to reading the accused his or her rights.</span></p>
