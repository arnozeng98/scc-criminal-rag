Such was not the case here.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, there was no reasonable possibility of unreliability in the statement.&nbsp; If there is nonetheless a possibility that the statement is prejudicial in the evidentiary sense, in that it could mislead a trier of fact by causing it to follow an inappropriate chain of logic, then that problem must be addressed within the context of the traditional balancing test which inquires into whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. </span></p>

Black</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138.&nbsp; In <i>Black</i>, after the occurrence of a s.&nbsp;10(<i>b</i>) violation, an accused helped the police identify a particular knife as the murder weapon.&nbsp; Wilson J. admitted this piece of real evidence, noting at p.&nbsp;164 that she had "little doubt that the police would have conducted a search of the appellant's apartment with or without her assistance and that such a search would have uncovered the knife".&nbsp; Consequently, the position that the trial judge's discretion should, in the preponderance of cases, be exercised in favour of exclusion with respect to derivative evidence which <u>would not have been obtained but for a witness's testimony</u> is, in fact, consonant with <i>Black</i>.</span></p>

After all, the improperly obtained evidence formed a critical component of the Crown's case and it cannot be said that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different were this evidence to have been properly excluded at trial: <i>R. v. Bevan</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599.&nbsp; This is not a case that fits into the small exception mentioned in <i>Elshaw</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;46, where the curative provision could apply notwithstanding that evidence should have been excluded under s.&nbsp;24(2).&nbsp; Unlike in <i>R. v. Hodge</i> (1993), 133 N.B.R. (2d) 240, where the curative provision was applied because the evidence excluded under s.&nbsp;24(2) could not have factored very significantly in the conviction of the accused, I find that there was a reasonable possibility that the impugned evidence in this case (a murder weapon and evidence that the accused took the police to find that weapon) could have weighed significantly in his conviction.&nbsp; The trial judge's instruction to the jury reproduced by L'Heureux-Dubé J. does not alter my view in this regard.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In what most would agree is the quintessential pronouncement on s. 24(2), Lamer J. then gave form and substance to several of these principles, at pp. 280-81:</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640.&nbsp; Although Lamer J. justified this lower threshold in part on the fact that violations of the Constitution should be subject to greater scrutiny than "dirty tricks" under the common law, he expounded in some detail upon a second rationale which bears recalling.&nbsp; Namely, he observed that while both the English text of s. 24(2) and the language used by this Court in <i>Rothman</i> use the words "<u>would</u> bring the administration of justice into disrepute", the French version of s. 24(2) provides that evidence shall be excluded that "<u>could</u> bring the administration of justice into disrepute".&nbsp; He then chose the French text as the version that was more suited to protecting the right of the accused to a fair trial.&nbsp; Consequently, the origins of the <i>Collins</i> test, as well as the availability of a remedy in s. 24(2), is actually tied to the French text rather than to the English text.&nbsp; Evidence shall be excluded under s. 24(2) whenever its admission <u>could</u> bring the administration of justice into disrepute.&nbsp; I will return to this matter later, for it is significant when considering the interaction between <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C., 1985, c.

Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151) or through individuals effectively acting as agents of the state (<i>R. v. Broyles</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595).&nbsp; In both of those types of situations, the court is faced with evidence arising as a direct result of an unconstitutional scheme on the part of the authorities, and obtained in the manner reasonably anticipated by the police.&nbsp; The judicial sanction of such unconstitutional activity by admitting evidence thus obtained can have significant repercussions in the long-term on citizens' dignity and right generally to be free from unwarranted interference from the state.&nbsp; Admission of evidence under such circumstances could bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes of the reasonable person, dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances. </span></p>

Ross</i> in which this distinction is blurred, discoverability has been used to place the evidence in one or other of these two categories.&nbsp; If the evidence was discoverable without the participation of the accused, then it has the attributes of real evidence.&nbsp; Conversely, evidence that clearly emanates from the accused such as statements has not been subjected to the discoverability analysis.&nbsp; While it can be argued that when an accused has been denied the right to counsel under s. 10(<i>b</i>), an inquiry could be made as to whether the accused would have acted differently had his <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights been observed, the Court has generally refused to enter into such an inquiry.&nbsp; See <i>R. v.
