   <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law — Duty of an appellate tribunal — Charge of assault causing bodily harm — Trial judge failing to consider evidence of four witnesses — Whether the trial judge overlooked evidence bearing on the relevant issue — New trial ordered.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">An incident that occurred during appellant police officer's arrest of a youth for drunkenness led to his being charged and convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The trial judge did not take into account the evidence of four witnesses who did not, in his opinion, observe the events at the moment the appellant was alleged to have hit the youth. The question is whether, by eliminating this evidence, the trial judge has so misdirected himself as to the relevant evidence that the conviction cannot stand.</span></p>

   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Martland, Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: An appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor the right to reassess evidence at trial for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence. Its duty, however, includes a review of the record below to determine whether the trial court has properly directed itself to all the evidence bearing on the relevant issues. Where the record discloses a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence, the reviewing tribunal must intercede. In the present case, a review of the record showed that the trial judge failed entirely to consider all the evidence bearing on the time period which he himself found to be vital. A new trial is ordered.</span></p>

   <p class="History"><span lang="EN-CA">APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissing the appellant's appeal from his conviction on a charge of assault causing bodily harm. Appeal allowed, Ritchie J. dissenting.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:1.4pt">ESTEY </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:2.4pt">J.—I</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:1.4pt"> </span><span lang="EN-CA">have had the opportunity of reading the judgment herein of my colleague, Ritchie J., and for reasons which I shall now advance I must, with all respect, come to the opposite conclusion; that is I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial. Because in my view a new trial should be the result of this appeal I will confine my observations to the two grounds which, in my respectful view, direct this disposition. Firstly, the learned trial judge failed entirely to take into account all the evidence which bore on the time period which the trial court found to be vital in this proceeding, and secondly, the proceedings at trial and on appeal have been completed without any reference to s. 25 of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal </span>Code </i>which deals with the protection afforded by law of a peace officer such as the accused when acting "on reasonable and probable grounds" providing that in so doing such a person uses "as much force as is necessary".</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 4]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I turn to the first ground. The learned trial judge, in his oral reasons, found that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... the events immediately prior to that moment in time [that is the arrival of the second officer] are the significant events. What happened after that does not directly relate to the matter in issue.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The court then proceeded to examine the evidence, stating:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Considering those events, that is to say from the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">moment when Cst. Harper first spoke with Mr. Higgin</span>son up to the point when he, Cst. Harper and Cst. Ellis saw the missing tooth and the blood, I look at the evidence of the other witnesses and I have had an opportunity to go carefully through all of my notes, which I took in some detail, and I find that no other witness observed the events prior to the second officer appearing on the scene.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There were, as we shall see, four witnesses other than the informant, Higginson, and the Crown witness, Lindhout. The evidence of these witnesses was expressly not taken into account in the judgment process not because of rejection on the grounds of credibility but apparently because the learned judge had concluded that none of those four witnesses "observed the events prior to the second officer appearing on the scene". The judgment at trial then concluded:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">So that none of them are of <u>any</u> assistance with regard <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">to that exchange and it is clear that the injuries of which</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Mr. Higginson complains specially, that is, the injuries</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">to his eye, his cheek and his tooth and mouth, took place</span> prior to the second officer appearing. [My emphasis.]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Earlier in the judgment the trial judge specifically excluded the evidence of one witness, Mr. Dhaliwal, who clearly testified only to the events occurring after the second officer had arrived "which narrows us down to Miss Lindhout and Mr. Higginson". The question therefore is whether, by thus eliminating the evidence of the other four witnesses in this fashion, the trial judge has so misdirected himself as to the relevant evidence that the conviction cannot stand.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 5]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">In order to resolve this question it is necessary to set out some of the evidence of the witnesses R. Harris, W. Harris, Jensen and Constable Ellis. First the evidence of R. Harris, called on behalf of the accused, who at the time in question was a passenger in his father's truck in the parking lot adjoining the service station where the events in question took place. In one of the exhibits the position of the witness with reference to the police car driven by the accused is illustrated and no obstruction between the truck and the parked police car is shown, nor is any mentioned in the evidence. The relevant excerpts from the evidence of R. Harris are as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. And when you looked around, what did you see? </span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Just the police car there and the two people talking.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. There was a police car there and two people talking. Was one of the people talking, was one in uniform?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Yes.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. What uniform was he in? </span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Police uniform.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. And the man that the police officer was talking—could you recognize the police officer if you saw <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">him again in civilian clothes? Could you recognize</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">the policeman if you saw him again from his face?</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. I don't know.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Is the police officer, is he—is there a man in Court with the same face as the police officer? Sitting in Court? Could you look around? Do you know?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Well, I know that was one of the police officers.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Who?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. That man over there.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. When you first saw the police car and the police officer in uniform and the man at the service station; how many policemen were there?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. One.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. And you know the man over there was one of the two police officers?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. He was the first one.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. He was the first one? </span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Yes.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. And what was that man over there doing with the other man at the service station? When there was only one police </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">officer, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">what were they doing?</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 6]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Sort of just struggling.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. The first time you saw them both, what </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">were </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">they doing?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. It looked like they were just talking like.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Yes. Now, tell us in your own words what you remember seeing, Randy. The first time you saw them, they were just talking. Now, I want you to tell His Honour everything in your own words. Just go on from there?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Well, we pulled around the back of the service station, onto the Dog House parking lot and they were starting to just struggle over something. I don't know. And a couple of minutes later another police car pulled up, across the road and into the front of the Shell Station. And then they struggled a little longer and then they both went down with the civilian and when they got back up, they had the handcuffs on him.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">[…]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. And did you see any punches, or blows with fists, being thrown by any of the police officers? </span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. No.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Did you see any of the police officers kick this man?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. No.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. When you saw there was—I think, Randy, you used the term "struggle". Your Honour .. .</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. When you used the word "struggle", can you describe the struggle? What sort of struggle was it?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Sort of like wrestling.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Wrestling? </span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Sort of like.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Any punching by anybody? </span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. No.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. Were you interested—did you watch it the whole time, or did you take your eyes off it and look at other things?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. I was watching it most of the time.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. About how far away were you and your dad from the struggle? You know how long a car is, Randy. I presume a car might be as long as this table. I am terrible . . .</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I do not mean that a trial judge is obliged in his judgment to give all the reasons which lead him to the conclusion that an accused is guilty. Undoubtedly if he finds one valid reason why he should reach that conclusion it is not necessary that he should also give other reasons. It is imperative, however, that he should give a decision upon all the points raised by the defence which might be of a nature to bring about the acquittal of the accused. In the present case, disearding, as he did, as "fantastic", the explanation of Ungaro's denial to the police was insufficient to find the accused guilty. It was much more important that the trial judge should have addressed himself to the main point in the accused's defence, and which was the explanation of the circumstances which accompanied the purchase from Seguin, the thief, of the goods stolen. As to that the learned trial judge said absolutely nothing in his reasons, and, reading them, a Court of Appeal is perfectly justified in holding that he completely overlooked this point.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">This issue was apparently raised in the Court of Appeal but, in the reasons for judgment of Craig J.A., it seems to have been disposed of on the basis that the trial judge determined the point on the basis of credibility, rather than on whether the effect </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">of </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">the trial judge's reasoning leading to conviction was the wrongful exclusion from his consideration of the evidence </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">of </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">four witnesses bearing on the issue which the trial judge himself had found to be the vital one. Lambert J.A. acknowledged:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">If the trial judge completely overlooked part of the evidence of four witnesses that related to events occurring before the second police vehicle came to a stop at</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">the gas station, then, in my opinion, there would in this</span><span lang="EN-CA"> case have been a miscarriage of justice and the appeal ought to be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The learned justice then formed the opinion that the trial judge did not wholly overlook this evidence. This opinion was apparently reached on the basis of a later reference in the trial judgment to the "exchange" between the accused and the informant Higginson and that this term should be taken as meaning the narrow time period between the confrontation of the police officer and the person being arrested and the time that the punches were allegedly delivered. I must respectfully disagree with the application of such fine reasoning to explanatory reasons given in a criminal court for the conviction of an accused. Lambert J.A. expressed something of this same thought when later the learned justice states:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I would add also that there is, to my mind, considerable ambiguity as to what is meant by the words "prior to the second officer appearing on the scene".</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It was argued by the appellant before us that such ambiguity, particularly in criminal proceedings, should be resolved in favour of the accused. I do not think that this is a situation of ambiguity in the sense of equivocal meanings of expressions found in penal statutes. What we are here concerned with is whether or not the trial court, in assessing the evidence in the course of finding guilt on the part of the accused, has fatally overlooked relevant evidence submitted to the court on the very issue which must be determined.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The trial judge in his report to the Court of Appeal under s. 609(1) of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Criminal Code </span></i>stated:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Craig J.A., in the Court of Appeal, adverted to this ground of appeal when he stated:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Mr. Owen-Flood [counsel for the accused] submitted that four witnesses for the defence did, in fact, give testimony about what they saw happening at the service station between Higginson and Constable Harper before the arrival of Ellis and that, therefore, the judge erred in not considering this testimony when considering particu</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">larly</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">whether he should find Miss Lindhout and Mr. Higginson to be credible witnesses, as he in fact found.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Mr. Owen-Flood submitted to this Court that his point had not been correctly taken by the Court of Appeal. The submission with reference to the evidence of the four witnesses was made not with reference to the issue of credibility, with which the trial judge was so much concerned, but on the issue that by the wrongful exclusion of this evidence from the judgment process the trial court had misdirected itself, a misdirection which if given to a jury would have been fatal to a fair trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The learned justice on appeal then concluded:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">On this basis, the trial judge could very well in reviewing the evidence and his notes conclude, as he did conclude, that their testimony on this particular point was not helpful.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">But the trial judge did not conclude the evidence in question was "not helpful". Rather he found:</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(c) ". . . which narrows us down to Miss Lindhout and Mr. Higginson".</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Lambert J.A., as I have said, addressed this ground of appeal directly. He concluded, by attributing a narrow meaning to the reference by the trial judge to "an exchange" between the informant and the accused, that the trial judge had in fact considered the evidence of all the witnesses before reducing his consideration of the relevant evidence (in his view) to that of Higginson and Lindhout. The words used by the trial judge in </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">giving his reasons for the conviction of the accused</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> do not, however, lend themselves, in my respectful view, to such a fine and narrow interpretation. Whether such a process of interpretation should be applied in determining the propriety of a self-direction in a criminal trial is another aspect which need not be determined here. In my view it is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal to apply</span></p>

Such being the case, in my view the proper procedure in this proceeding is an order directing a new trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">A second element of law arose in the course of the hearing of this appeal before this Court when my colleague Lamer J. enquired of both counsel as to whether s. 25(1) of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Code</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"></span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The accused here was admittedly a peace officer. He was at the time in question in the act of arresting the informant for drunkenness. The evidence of the Crown witness Lindhout was that the informant was intoxicated. The trial judge found the informant "had been drinking in the evening in question". That a peace officer is justified in arresting a person for being intoxicated in a public place contrary to a provincial statute, if the peace officer reasonably believes such person is intoxicated, has long been settled. In the course of so acting the peace officer has been provided with a defence in law not available to persons who do not come within s. 25. The trial court was not directed to the defence of the use of 'as much force as is necessary for that purpose' and hence no consideration of the evidence on this point was undertaken at trial.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The appeal is from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia which dismissed an appeal from the judgment of judge Millward convicting the appellant, a police officer, on a charge of assault causing bodily harm. The evidence discloses that after dark on an evening in February 1978, a young man by the name of Higginson who at the time had consumed something in excess of the amount of alcohol appropriate to his capacity, had decided to hitchhike from the City of Duncan on Vancouver Island to Victoria. For this purpose he was equipped with a packsack and before embarking on his hike he stopped at a food store where he purchased some chicken to sustain himself. Having acquired the chicken he took it to a self-serve gas station which was usually staffed by a girlfriend of his. On the night in question, however, another girl named Lindhout was on duty; she was a stranger to</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 20]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Higginson but nevertheless invited him into the booth where she worked so that he might have shelter while eating his chicken. Shortly after he had entered the booth a police car, operated by the appellant, Harper, drove into the service station and signalled for Higginson to come over to him and when the young man came out of the booth he was asked to take off the packsack he was wearing and there seems to be no doubt that he did this without too much trouble after Harper had got out of his car. It is also common ground that within a very few minutes another police car, operated by Constable Ellis, appeared on the scene and that he dismounted from his car and proceeded to assist Harper in subduing Higginson so as to get him into the police car for transfer to the police station, as he had by this time been placed under arrest by Harper for drunkenness.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">It is during the very brief period from the time that Higginson removed his packsack until the time when Constable Ellis arrived that the offence here charged was allegedly committed. As to this period there is direct conflict with Higginson saying that after he had removed his packsack and asked why he should get into the police car, Harper ". .. never said anything or nothing, he just punched me in the mouth and it knocked out my front tooth". Miss Lindhout swore that she saw these blows being delivered from a distance of 4 or 5 feet. On the other hand, Harper stoutly denied having delivered any blow. The learned trial judge believed the Crown witnesses and found Harper's story unworthy of belief.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">As the facts were carefully reviewed by the trial judge and as his findings were expressly affirmed by the Court of Appeal, I think it most convenient to reproduce his account of what occurred. Starting with a review of Miss Lindhout's evidence, the learned judge went on to say:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Miss Lindhout testified that she was working at the<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>Gulf Self-Serve that evening as cashier. She described<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> the view of the area that she had from her booth and </span>said that around 9:00 or 9;30 that evening she saw Mr.<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>Higginson. She had not seen him before. She saw him<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">crossing Trunk Road with his packsack and a little black</span><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> suitcase and with chicken and some salad.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 21]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">She spoke with him briefly. She said 'I assumed he was a little drunk when he asked for a car wash because he didn't have a car'. She said his walk was all right. They had a discussion and after about five minutes, the police car drove in.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">She says the police car drove to a position in front of the cash booth. Cst. Harper motioned with his finger to Higginson to come out, Higginson said, 'I guess I'd better go'. He went out and he spoke with Cst. Harper. The two spoke briefly, the accused, Cst. Harper, was in the car, Mr. Higginson was facing him.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Cst. Harper got out of the car, the boy turned and motioned towards his pack. Cst. Harper helped him remove the pack, the black case was on the ground. Higginson turned around and the accused started to hit him in the face. She saw no prior violence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Mr. Higginson stepped back a bit, the young lady said, 'After I seen him get hit a couple of times in the face, I got up and went out. I said, 'What are you doing. He may have had a couple of drinks but that's no reason to hit him like that'. Cst. Harper responded, 'Get inside where you're supposed to be'.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">She said, 'What is your badge number?' Cst. Harper said, 'If you don't get inside, I'll arrest you for obstructing an officer in the line of duty'. She went inside and the other police car drove up.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">She insisted that Mr. Higginson did not offer any violence to anyone. When the other officer approached, the young lady went outside again to talk to the boy and she saw that Higginson's face was bleeding and his tooth was missing.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In cross-examination she said after the backpack had been removed, the boy turned to face the accused and she saw the policeman hit the boy in the face with his clenched fist. She was quite definite about this. She said, 'I seen him hit him in the face'.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">She was asked, 'Have you any doubt about it'?' and replied, 'None'.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">When referred to her testimony in the preliminary inquiry, she said that since then she had had time to think things over and she is very sure the boy was hit in the face. She was about <i>four or five feet away from the participants when she witnessed these events.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Now, Cst. Harper says, in effect, that for reasons that he explained, he felt it incumbent upon him to investi<span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">gate</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">the circumstances of Mr. Higginson and he looked for him and he found him in the Shell booth. He gestured to Higginson to come out; Higginson picked up his horn case, he had a bag of chicken in his hand, he set the case down and leaned over to speak with Cst. Harper.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">There was a discussion, the constable decided that Mr. Higginson was drunk and that he should not be on the highway for his own safety and he told Mr. Higginson that he was arrested, being arrested for being drunk in a public place and he described the further conversation and his attempts to put Mr. Higginson in the car, and the difficulties he had in doing so.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Cst. Ellis drove up, the young lady came out and said, 'Why are you hitting him?' He said, 'Go back or I'll charge you . . . ' and so on. Cst. Ellis asked what was going on, Cst. Harper said, 'I'm trying to get this fellow into the car', whereupon Higginson turned his face around and it was apparent that he, Higginson, at that point in time had a tooth missing and had blood on his lip.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">Now, in my view, the events immediately prior to that moment in time are the significant events. What happened after that does not directly relate to the matter in issue. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">I heard a good deal of evidence as to the conduct of Mr. Higginson after that time and it is very likely that he was the author of some of his own injuries from then on.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Considering those events, that is to say from the moment when Cst. Harper first spoke with Mr. Higginson up to the point when he, Cst. Harper and Cst. Ellis saw the missing tooth and the blood, I look at the evidence of the other witnesses and I have had an opportunity to go carefully through all of my notes, which I took in some detail, and I find that no other witness observed the events prior to the second officer appearing on the scene. So that none of them are of any assistance with regard to that exchange and it is clear that the injuries of which Mr. Higginson complains specifically, that is, the injuries to his eye, his cheek and his tooth and mouth, took place prior to the second officer appearing.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">So what we have is a situation where Higginson suffered those injuries in a' span of a minute or two or three while he was confronting Cst. Harper. Cst. Harper says he does not know how the injuries took place, he can only offer the hypothesis that they were accidental and that Higginson's face came into contact with some' part of the police car because of the struggle.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 23]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">On the other side of the picture, the Crown witness Dhaliwal positively states that he saw two officers striking the victim. I do not think Mr. Dhaliwal's evidence is particularly helpful in view of the finding that I have made that the significant injuries took place prior to the second officer coming on the scene, which narrows us down to Miss Lindhout and Mr. Higginson.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I observed Miss Lindhout with great care and in my opinion, she gave her evidence with a sincere desire to describe the events precisely as they took place. Undoubtedly, she cannot remember every detail and undoubtedly some of the sequence of events may disagree with other witnesses but I am satisfied beyond any shadow of a doubt that she told the story as she saw it.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">1 am satisfied that she described Cst. Harper striking Mr. Higginson, honestly, and I accept her evidence. I find that Cst. Harper's denial is not credible, that notwithstanding the evidence of good character, all of which 1 accept, 1 am unable to accept his statement that he did not strike Mr. Higginson and find it a fact that he did assault Mr. Higginson as charged by striking him with his fist in the face more than once; that he had no justification for doing so and that by so striking him, he caused bodily harm. And as a result, I find Cst. Harper guilty as charged.</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Assuming that the question, whether there was any evidence to support a conviction, should be deemed a question of law, the question whether the proper inference has been drawn by the trial judge from facts established in evidence, is really not a question of law,</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">but purely a question of fact for his consideration.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The facts as found by the learned trial judge in the present case were expressly adopted by the Court of Appeal and the questions of law advanced on behalf of the appellant as justification in the present appeal are the following:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. Whether the Court of Appeal for British Columbia <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">erred in law in concluding that the Learned Trial Judge</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">had properly directed himself on all relevant, admissible</span> evidence, when the Reasons for Judgment of the Learned Trial Judge disclose a failure to consider relevant, admissible evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">2. Whether the Court of Appeal for British Columbia <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">erred, when having found ambiguity in the Reasons for</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Judgment of the Learned Trial Judge, in not giving the</span> benefit of that ambiguity to the Appellant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">3. Whether the Court of Appeal for British Columbia erred in law in concluding that as long as there was some evidence upon which the Learned Trial Judge <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">could have convicted, it should not and could not interfere with the verdict, even where the Reasons for Judgment of the Learned Trial judge in convicting expressly</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">disclosed a failure to consider relevant, admissible evi</span>dence at trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Three judges (Craig, Lambert and MacDonald JJ.A.) sat on the appeal but only Craig and Lambert delivered reasons for judgment whereas MacDonald J.A. limited himself to a concurrence. All the judgments were oral, and in the result were unanimous in dismissing the appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It appears to me to be desirable to deal with the second issue raised by the appellant and in this regard it should be pointed out that there was no finding of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia as to ambiguity in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge. The only mention of ambiguity is to be found in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Lambert where he says:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I would add also that there is, to my mind, considerable ambiguity as to what is meant by the words "prior to the second officer appearing on the scene".</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">When reference is had to the above quoted excerpt from the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge it will be apparent that he considered the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 25]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">events of the evening to be divided between the period prior to the appearance of the second officer and the events which occurred after his arrival. The trial judge said of the witnesses who did not observe the prior events:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">So that none </span><span lang="EN-CA">of </span><span lang="EN-CA">them are of any assistance with regard <span style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt">to that exchange and it</span> </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt">is </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">clear that the injuries of which</span><span lang="EN-CA"> Mr. Higginson complains specifically, that is, the inju<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">ries to his eye, his cheek and his tooth and mouth, took</span> place prior to the second officer appearing.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In any event, Mr. Justice Lambert's use of the word "ambiguity" in his reasons for judgment is qualified by the second to last paragraph where he says:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... it </span><span lang="EN-CA">is </span><span lang="EN-CA">my opinion that any ambiguity about the disputed sentence in the reasons for judgment of the <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">trial judge can be resolved by reference to the remainder</span> <span style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt">of his judgment and the evidence that was before him.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">When the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal are read as a whole, it will be seen that there is no finding of ambiguity in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge. As to the first and third issues raised as questions of law by the appellant, it will be observed that they are both predicated on the suggestion that the learned trial judge failed to consider the relevant admissible evidence. This appears to be based on the assumption that four of the witnesses for the appellant gave evidence which was relevant to the issue and which was completely ignored by the trial judge. The fact of the matter is, however, that none of these witnesses purported to have observed the actions of Harper and Higginson during the vital period before the arrival of Constable Ellis, which is the time when the assault is alleged to have taken place. It is furthermore of significance that although the appellant describes the witnesses called on his behalf as having testified in direct contradiction to the evidence of Lindhout and Higginson, they were actually unable to go any further than to assert that they had seen no blows delivered by Harper and none of them was able to say that no blows had been delivered at the time of which Higginson complains.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is apparent from a review of the reasons for judgment at trial and those of the Court of Appeal</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 26]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">that any differences between the judgment and the allegations of the appellant before this Court are based upon the trial judge's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. What we have here is a case of concurrent findings of fact based upon the trial judge's assessment of the witnesses and it has long been recognized in this Court that it is only in the rarest of cases that we will accept the responsibility as a second court of appeal of reversing such findings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the case of R. v. <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.4pt">Warner, </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[1961] </span><i><span style="letter-spacing:.4pt">S.C.R. </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">144, </span>the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed the appeal in part on the first ground that in its opinion</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">.. the verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on</span><span lang="EN-CA"> the ground that it could not be supported by the evidence, .. .</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As to this finding, Mr. Justice Cartwright, speaking for the majority of the Court, stated that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">So far as the judgment of the Appellate Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">powerless to interfere with it. The question whether the</span> Appellate Division was right in proceeding on this <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">ground is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">question of fact or, at the best from the point of view of</span> the appellant, a mixed question of fact and law.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The position of an appellate court in such circumstances as those here disclosed is most dramatically described by Lord Shaw in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Clarke v. Edinburgh and District Tramways Co., Ltd., </span></i>[1919] S.C. (H.L) 35, at p. 37:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In my opinion, the duty of an appellate Court in those circumstances is for each Judge of it to put to himself, as I now do in this case, the question, Am I—who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who heard and tried the case—in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the Judge with those <span style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt">privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be</span> my duty to defer to his judgment.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Having regard to all the above and with the greatest respect for those who may entertain a different view, I would dismiss this appeal.</span></p>
