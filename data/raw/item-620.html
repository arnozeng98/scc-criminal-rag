 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, when a court is faced with circumstances in which the time of the offence cannot be determined with precision or the information conflicts with the evidence, the first question that must be asked is whether time is either an essential element of the offence or crucial to the defence.&nbsp; It will only be in cases where this first question is answered affirmatively that the trier of fact must then determine whether the time of the offence has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; If the answer to the first question is in the negative, a conviction may result even although the time of the offence is not proven, provided that the rest of the Crown's case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, however, the trial judge failed to address the first question.&nbsp; He found on the evidence before him that the date of the offence had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused.&nbsp; In doing so he erred.&nbsp; (I add in fairness to the learned trial judge that he was understandably misled by the sparse report of</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Hamilton-Middleton</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> upon which he relied in reaching his decision.)&nbsp; Had the trial judge directed himself to the first question, he would have been forced to conclude that time was not an essential element of the offence or crucial to the defence.&nbsp; Indeed, the date of the offence is not generally an essential element of the offence of sexual assault.&nbsp; It is a crime no matter when it is committed.&nbsp; From the record in this case it is also clear that the date of the offence was not crucial to the defence.&nbsp; The appellants' claim on appeal that the date was crucial because alibi evidence was led cannot, in my view, be seriously maintained.&nbsp; At trial each appellant testified and put forward only general denials.&nbsp; They did not lead alibi evidence at that time.&nbsp; Moreover, since the alleged assault took place in the school washroom during recess, the only possible alibi would seem to be that one or more of the appellants was not in attendance at school during the relevant period specified in the information or suggested by the evidence.&nbsp; There is nothing in the record to support this.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I conclude therefore that the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the time of the offence was not an essential element in the circumstances of this case and need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; I also agree with the Court of Appeal that if the assault took place as alleged the evidence supports the conclusion that it occurred some time between November 1, 1985 and December 20, 1985 and that amending the information to this effect would not cause irreparable harm to the appellants.&nbsp; Since the trial judge made no findings of fact apart from the time element the Court of Appeal was correct in concluding that a new trial was necessary.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">, Wakeling J.A. having firmly stated they were not to be viewed as affecting the main judgment with which he concurred, it is not strictly necessary for this Court to deal with them.&nbsp; However, in light of the importance of the testimony of the complainant in this case as well as the testimony of the children in the related appeals, I think this Court should address them, albeit briefly.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dealing first with Wakeling J.A.'s comments regarding the credibility of child witnesses it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that the judiciary should take a common sense approach when dealing with the testimony of young children and not impose the same exacting standard on them as it does on adults.&nbsp; However, this is not to say that the courts should not carefully assess the credibility of child witnesses and I do not read his reasons as suggesting that the standard of proof must be lowered when dealing with children as the appellants submit.&nbsp; Rather, he was expressing concern that a flaw, such as a contradiction, in a child's testimony should not be given the same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an adult.&nbsp; I think his concern is well founded and his comments entirely appropriate.&nbsp; While children may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it.&nbsp; In recent years we have adopted a much more benign attitude to children's evidence, lessening the strict standards of oath taking and corroboration, and I believe that this is a desirable development.&nbsp; The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts must, of course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the "reasonable adult" is not necessarily appropriate in assessing the credibility of young children.</span></p>
