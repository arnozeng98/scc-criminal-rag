Review Board dispositions in 1994, 1995 and 1996 provided for conditional discharges but in 1997, when the respondent’s urine tested positive for cannabis, the psychiatric hospital told the Board that it could no longer support a conditional discharge order because of the respondent’s continued substance abuse and the hospital’s need for flexibility “to react quickly to known increases in risk”.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Court of Appeal reweighed the evidence and found it wanting.&nbsp; That assessment, however, was for the Board to make, and the decision it made was reasonably open to it on the evidence.&nbsp; It was not enough to suggest that other members of other review boards might have taken a different view of the evidence. The Review Board could reasonably conclude that the respondent’s demonstrated capacity for violence when taking amphetamines or cocaine, now linked to recent evidence of resumed use of cocaine, rendered him a significant threat to the public’s safety.&nbsp; The “logical process” by which it sought to draw its conclusion from the resumed use of cocaine was squarely within its expertise.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Ontario Court of Appeal pointed out that from 1994 to 1996 the respondent had been granted conditional discharges, but in 2000 the Review Board was required to deal with the respondent’s situation as it found it to be in 2000.&nbsp; The various hospital recommendations from 1994 to 1999 were made at a time when the hospital mistakenly believed that the respondent was undertaking successful steps to control the substance abuse that, in its view, had been the catalyst for earlier acts of violence.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Given the continuing use of cocaine and the consequent risk to society posed by the respondent, it was also not unreasonable for the Review Board to have concluded that its disposition was the least onerous and least restrictive alternative.

British Columbia (Attorney-General)</i> (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 269 (B.C.C.A.), at p.&nbsp;277, “[u]nder s.&nbsp;672.54 of the <i>Code</i>, the treatment of one unable to judge right from wrong is intended to cure the defect.&nbsp; It is not penal in purpose or effect.&nbsp; Where custody is imposed on such a person, the purpose is prevention of antisocial acts, not retribution.”</p>

A, which permits the court to “receive new or additional evidence as it considers just” (s.&nbsp;80(9)).&nbsp; We concluded in that case that reception of the proffered evidence would not be “just”.&nbsp; Unlike here, no issue of public safety was raised.&nbsp; Here, an absolute discharge of the NCR detainee would, for all practical purposes, terminate the state’s capacity to supervise and monitor the respondent’s mental condition under Part XX.1 of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Under the substituted consent provisions of the <i>Health Care Consent Act, 1996</i>, on the other hand, the attending physician can always reapply to the Capacity and Consent Board based on up-to-date information.&nbsp; In short, the consequences of a misjudged denial of state intervention are much more serious in the case of an NCR detainee than in the case of a patient resisting unwanted medical treatment.&nbsp; The interests of justice in the circumstances of this case require a different result.</p>

C.</i>, s.&nbsp;672.73(1)).&nbsp; The NCR detainee should, of course, be given the opportunity of countering the fresh evidence of risk by cross-examination or filing additional evidence in response.&nbsp; In the end, however, the Crown has the onus of establishing a significant risk to public safety and, in the interest of public safety, it should be given every reasonable opportunity to do so.&nbsp;</p>

This is explained in the KPH report to the Board of April 1997 as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">Mr. Owen has, once again, demonstrated that he is unlikely to refrain from petty criminal behaviour, or legal behaviour yet prohibited to him, over the longer-term.&nbsp; He has acknowledged this to the Board in previous hearings and history would appear to confirm it.&nbsp; However, in the hospital’s opinion, Mr. Owen has, otherwise, managed reasonably well in the face of major medical, social, financial and domestic difficulties.&nbsp; Throughout these past several years, there has been no evidence of criminal behaviour which has resulted in the victimization of anyone.&nbsp; Indeed, Mr. Owen, with his c/l wife (herself suffering from a major mental illness), has made a reasonable job of raising a small son and living peacefully in the community with extremely limited resources.&nbsp; Despite occasional opposition, the hospital sees itself as playing an ongoing and important role in this exercise.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">The hospital considers it unfortunate that it has not, on this occasion and others, had available a custodial disposition which would have provided the hospital with authority to act pro-actively in the face of obviously mounting difficulties in the Owen household.&nbsp; The occasion of such mounting difficulties culminating in consumption of prohibited substances is entirely predictable in this case.&nbsp; It has happened now on several occasions in the past and will happen in the future.&nbsp; On each such occasion, when the hospital is unable to require either hospital admission or significant changes in supervision, the community is placed at risk.&nbsp; The community would fail to appreciate why it is that KPH is unable to react quickly to known increases in risk.&nbsp; This situation is very likely to occur time and time again in the future.&nbsp; The role of the hospital should be to ensure that it is managed in a timely manner, consistent with the long-term rehabilitation needs of Mr. Owen and not contrary to the safety of the public.&nbsp; The hospital sees no useful purpose in a several month hospitalization every time this happens while Mr. Owen awaits the pleasure of the Board.&nbsp; Indeed, the results of the current administrative arrangement — a Conditional Discharge Order — are contrary to the rehabilitation needs of Mr. Owen and do nothing to protect the public.</p>

I would however point out that the use by Parliament of virtually identical language in ss. 672.78 and 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) creates the obvious anomaly that the same words in different sections of the same statute — the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> — mean something entirely different.&nbsp; While, as expressed by Binnie J., “unreasonable” in s. 672.78 means “unreasonable in the sense of not being supported by reasons that can&nbsp; bear even a somewhat probing examination” (para. 33), the same expression in s. 686 means that no reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting judicially could have convicted (see <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, 2000 SCC 15, at para. 36; <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at p. 185).&nbsp; This, in my view, is akin to the standard of patent unreasonableness, rather than reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i>, as these standards are understood in administrative law.</p>

[He] has<u> resumed</u> the use of cocaine, drugs similar to that psychosis which preceded the events described at the time of the index offence” (emphasis added).&nbsp; As I indicated earlier, while there is evidence that the respondent had been drinking heavily at the time of the 1990 assault, there is no evidence that the respondent was in a drug-induced psychosis at that time.&nbsp; Had he been, he probably would have been found not criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder as he had been at the time of the 1978 index offence.</p>
