 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Although it is possible, in certain circumstances, to distinguish between the use of evidence to challenge the credibility of an accused and its use on the merits, that is not the case with the confessions rule.&nbsp; That rule provides that an involuntary confession may not be used for any purpose.&nbsp; The confessions rule excludes the protected statement because it is derived from the prior inadmissible confession.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Section&nbsp;672.21 of the <i>Code</i> is not inconsistent with the application of the confessions rule.&nbsp; In enacting the section, Parliament sought a balance between the need to learn the truth and the protection of accused persons ordered to undergo an assessment of their mental capacity.&nbsp; This balance would be difficult to achieve if the rules of evidence which provide for the exclusion of otherwise inadmissible evidence were set aside.&nbsp; If the exception in s.&nbsp;672.21(3)(<i>f</i>) does allow previously excluded evidence to be reintroduced indirectly, accused persons will refuse to answer some of their psychiatrist‚Äôs questions for fear this evidence may be reintroduced at trial.&nbsp; Even more importantly, we must prefer an interpretation of s.&nbsp;672.21(3)(<i>f</i>) that does not make the provision of no force or effect, if that interpretation is at all plausible.&nbsp; Now that the confessions rule, which does not allow for any use of an involuntary statement, has been given constitutional expression, using evidence contrary to this rule would infringe <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Finally, nothing in the wording of s.&nbsp;672.21(3)(<i>f</i>) indicates that Parliament wanted to abolish the confessions rule; the interpretation that is contrary to the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> must therefore be rejected.</span></p>

(L.R.) and T. (E.)</i>.&nbsp; The tainting features which disqualified the first confession were no longer present, and the first statement did not effectively deprive the accused of the choice of whether to make the subsequent statement.&nbsp; The substantial connection between the two statements required by the law to establish involuntariness is therefore not present in this case.&nbsp; To assert that every statement similar to or derived from an inadmissible confession thereby becomes inadmissible is to undermine the rationale of choice that lies at the heart of the confessions rule and the doctrine of derivative exclusion.&nbsp; Connectedness or similarity between a prior inconsistent statement and a subsequent statement renders the subsequent statement inadmissible only if it rises to the level of showing that the connection may have rendered the second statement involuntary.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
</div> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>
<div class="Section18">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">Under the rules relating to confessions at common law, the admissibility of a confession which had been preceded by an involuntary confession involved a factual determination based on factors designed to ascertain the degree of connection between the two statements.&nbsp; These included <u>the time span between the statements, advertence to the previous statement during questioning, the discovery of additional incriminating evidence subsequent to the first statement, the presence of the same police officers at both interrogations and other similarities between the two circumstances</u>.&nbsp; See <i>Boudreau v. The King</i>, [1949] S.C.R. 262; <i>Horvath v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 2&nbsp;S.C.R. 376; and <i>Hobbins v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 553.&nbsp; No general rule excluded subsequent statements on the ground that they were tainted irrespective of the degree of connection to the initial admissible statement.&nbsp; In this regard I adopt the language of Laskin C.J. in <i>Hobbins</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;558, when he states:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
13.7pt;line-height:24.4pt">There can be no hard and fast rule that merely because a prior statement is ruled inadmissible a second statement taken by the same interrogating officers must be equally vulnerable.&nbsp; Factual considerations must govern, including similarity of circumstances and of police conduct and the lapse of time between the obtaining of the two statements.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Sopinka J. then concluded his discussion of the derived confessions rule by stating:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">In applying these factors, a subsequent confession would be involuntary if either the tainting features which disqualified the first confession continued to be present or if the fact that the first statement was made was a substantial factor contributing to the making of the second statement.</p>

(L.R.) and T. (E.)</i>, where Sopinka J. was dealing with a situation in which two confessions are made to persons in authority.&nbsp; It is sufficient to retain from it that the derived confessions rule applies where there is a sufficient connection between the two statements.&nbsp; This follows from the rationale for the rule.&nbsp; The Quebec Court of Appeal cited <i>Monette v. The Queen</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 400, in this regard, where the Court said of an inadmissible statement:&nbsp; ‚Äúnothing more ought to be heard of it‚Äù.&nbsp; The second statement is inadmissible because the first confession contaminated it.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not necessary to decide whether the second statement is a confession made to a person in authority in the present case.&nbsp; This interpretation also meets the requirements of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which entrenched certain aspects of the confessions rule in s.&nbsp;7.&nbsp; A confession found to be inadmissible could not be introduced indirectly without affecting the right to silence and the principle against self-incrimination, which is what we would be doing by admitting a statement that was ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù by an inadmissible confession.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 926.&nbsp; As the respondent states, Dr.&nbsp;Wolwertz in fact cross‚Äëexamined the accused on his first statement.</p>

The Minister of Justice indicated in introducing the provisions that she had received representations from the defence bar that lawyers were advising their clients to refuse to answer questions during such assessments to avoid the risk of incriminating statements.&nbsp; She noted that this practice threatened to undermine the effectiveness of court-ordered assessments.&nbsp; At the same time, the Minister&nbsp; indicated that she was alive to representations from those concerned with law enforcement that a complete interdiction on the use of such statements would deprive the courts of important information that might cast light on the accused‚Äôs situation and the crime.&nbsp; Section 672.21(3)(<i>f</i>) effects a compromise between these two Parliamentary purposes.&nbsp; To protect the confidentiality of the accused, s. 672.21 affirms that communications in court-ordered assessments or treatments are inadmissible in evidence absent consent, subject to certain exceptions.&nbsp; To uphold and protect the search for truth, s. 672.21(3)(<i>f</i>) creates a limited exception providing for the use of such statements to challenge the accused‚Äôs credibility where he or she takes the stand and testifies in a manner inconsistent with these statements.</p>

However, if an accused chooses to take the stand, that accused is implicitly vouching for his or her credibility.&nbsp; Such an accused, like any other witness, has therefore opened the door to having the trustworthiness of his/her evidence challenged.&nbsp; An interpretation of s.13 which insulates such an accused from having previous inconsistent statements put to him/her on cross-examination where the only purpose of doing so is to challenge that accused‚Äôs credibility, would, in my view, ‚Äústack the deck‚Äù too highly in favour of the accused.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This logic applies to all previously-made inconsistent statements of an accused, including&nbsp; inadmissible confessions.&nbsp; While the common law confessions rule has developed in a way that does not permit inadmissible confessions to be used to impeach credibility, Parliament has the power to alter the common law.&nbsp; It was therefore open to Parliament, absent constitutional impermissibility, to enact that all ‚Äúprotected statements‚Äù under s. 672.21, including inadmissible confessions, can be used to challenge the accused‚Äôs credibility if he or she takes the stand to tell a different story.&nbsp;</p>

Whittle</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914, constitutionalized aspects of the common law confessions rule, they did not endorse a constitutional right to be completely sheltered from all possible uses of inadmissible confessions as an inexorable remedy.&nbsp; Put in terms of this case, we cannot infer from the fact the accused holds a constitutional right to choose not to incriminate himself, that it is necessarily unconstitutional for Parliament to enact legislation that permits the use of such statements for the limited purpose of challenging credibility where the accused chooses to take the stand and ask the trier of fact to believe a different version of the events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
