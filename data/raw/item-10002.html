 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W shot S in the chest at close range with a .22‑calibre rifle and killed him.&nbsp; He was charged with and convicted of second degree murder.&nbsp; The outcome of the trial turned on W’s intent at the time of the shooting.&nbsp; The trial judge, sitting alone, rejected as not credible W’s theory that his act of pulling the trigger was involuntary and that the discharge of the gun had therefore been unintentional.&nbsp; He considered the salient features of the evidence that could have impacted W’s awareness of the consequences of his actions, but was left in no doubt that W was fully aware of the fatal consequences that were likely to follow when he pulled the trigger.&nbsp; He then reverted to the “common sense inference” that a sane and sober person intends the reasonable and probable consequences of his acts, and found that W had the requisite intent for second degree murder.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal, W claimed that in assessing whether he was aware of the consequences of shooting S — and thus possessed one or the other of the specific intents for murder —, the trial judge failed to consider evidence bearing on W’s mental state on the night of the shooting, such as his developmental delays and alcohol consumption.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.&nbsp; It found that no evidence had been led at trial as to W’s mental state that could call into question whether he was able to or did in fact foresee the consequences of his actions when he pulled the trigger.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>:&nbsp; The appeal and the motion to adduce fresh evidence should be dismissed.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A failure of a judge to consider all the evidence relating to an ultimate issue of guilt or innocence constitutes an error of law.&nbsp; However, there is no obligation in law on a trial judge to record all or any specific part of the process of deliberation on the facts.&nbsp; Unless the reasons demonstrate that a consideration of all the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue was not done, the failure to record the fact of it having been done is not a proper basis for concluding that there was an error of law in this respect.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the trial judge did not fail to consider all the relevant evidence.&nbsp; To determine whether the Crown had met its onus of proving that W possessed one or the other requisite intents for murder, the trial judge considered that the rifle was working normally; it had a safety mechanism; it required over six pounds of pressure to fire; W was familiar with the rifle and had previously used it; he knew the gun would fire when he pulled the trigger; he knew the safety was off; he was pointing the gun at S’s chest; he fired from a distance of only five feet; he knew the gun was loaded; he had been drinking but it was clear from the evidence as a whole that he was not impaired.&nbsp; The judge then applied the “common sense inference” and was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when W deliberately pulled the trigger, in the circumstances, he knew that the reasonable and probable consequence was that he would kill S or would cause him grievous bodily harm which he knew would likely cause his death, and was reckless as to whether or not death ensued.&nbsp; At trial, there was no evidence, forensic or otherwise, that could realistically have impacted on the issue of W’s mental state at the time of the shooting.&nbsp; In particular, no evidence was directed at whether in shooting the deceased in the chest at close range, W was aware of — and thus can be said to have intended — the consequences that were likely to follow from his action.&nbsp; Furthermore, W did not suggest that his mental state prevented him from knowing the likely consequences of his acts — nor could he, realistically.&nbsp; The evidence pointed overwhelmingly in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Moments before the shooting, W made it clear to his pursuers that he was aware that the weapon he was holding was lethal.&nbsp; Shortly after, he talked about killing himself with that very weapon.&nbsp; None of the evidence W points to on appeal — his developmental delays, his hospitalization under a mental health warrant, his “blank” affect prior to the shooting, his hand gestures and demeanour while testifying, and the fact that he was waving the rifle around before it was discharged — could have assisted him at trial.&nbsp; While it might have been preferable had the trial judge referred specifically to those items of evidence, he was not obliged to do so.&nbsp; He made no error.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fresh evidence consisting of a report prepared by a forensic psychiatrist for the sentencing hearing and subsequent testimony, which states that W suffers from Asperger’s disorder, paranoid personality disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, adult antisocial disorder and alcohol abuse disorder, does not meet the test for admission set out in <i>Palmer v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.&nbsp; Apart from the diagnosis of Asperger’s disorder, there is little evidence in the report that could not have been adduced at the trial.&nbsp; W had long been suspected of suffering from Asperger’s disorder, and medical professionals had noted his social difficulties, aggressiveness, fascination with guns and problems with alcohol for a very long time.&nbsp; A comprehensive report that mirrors the evidence W now seeks to tender had been prepared for sentencing purposes on W’s first trial, yet W made no effort to introduce it at the trial proper.&nbsp; In any event, the evidence, taken together with the other evidence adduced at trial, could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result.&nbsp; It does not suggest that W, by virtue of his diagnosed disorders, may not have been aware of the consequences that were likely to follow upon shooting someone in the chest at close range.&nbsp; Nor does it provide additional information that may have shed light on the unintentional discharge theory advanced at trial.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In jury trials where impairment by intoxication or otherwise might have contributed to the accused’s actions, the common sense inference instruction need not be tied to a rigid formula.&nbsp; While trial judges may choose to refer to the “sane and sober” person, a simple instruction along the lines that a person usually knows what the predictable consequences of his or her actions are, and means to bring them about, would suffice.&nbsp; What is critical is that the jury be made to understand, in clear terms, that in assessing the specific intent required for murder, it should consider the whole of the evidence that could realistically bear on the accused’s mental state at the time of the alleged offence.</p>

C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.&nbsp; Fundamentally, the appellant maintains that the trial judge erred in applying the “common sense inference” — that a sane and sober person intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her actions — to find that he had the requisite intent for murder, without first having considered the whole of the evidence bearing on his mental state at the time of the shooting.&nbsp; According to the appellant, had the trial judge considered his developmental delays, in conjunction with his alcohol consumption on the evening in question, he may have entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s intent when he fired the fatal shot.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a fallback position, the appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence on the appeal consisting of a report and testimony from a forensic psychiatrist prepared for the sentencing hearing.&nbsp; According to the appellant, the evidence bears directly on his mental state at the time of the shooting and it could have affected the result of the trial.&nbsp; He submits that it should be admitted in the interests of justice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would not give effect to the sole ground of appeal raised by the appellant.&nbsp; Nor would I admit the proposed fresh evidence.&nbsp; Accordingly, I would dismiss both the motion to adduce fresh evidence and the appeal.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts giving rise to the murder charge against the appellant are straightforward and, for the most part, uncontested.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 7, 2004, the appellant, then age 20, shot and killed Jeffrey Shuckburgh, the owner of a local bar in the City of Calgary.&nbsp; The murder weapon was a .22-calibre rifle that the appellant had stolen from his uncle’s farm a few weeks earlier.&nbsp; At the time of the shooting, the appellant was cradling the barrel of the rifle in his left hand and had his right index finger poised to squeeze the trigger.&nbsp; According to eyewitnesses, just before the gun went off, Mr. Shuckburgh was about five feet from the appellant, and the appellant was pointing the gun at Mr.&nbsp;Shuckburgh’s chest.&nbsp; A single shot was fired.&nbsp; It pierced Mr. Shuckburgh’s heart.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the several weeks leading up to the shooting, the appellant had been living at the home of a friend, Michael Stewart, and Michael’s mother, Adina Stewart.&nbsp; Before moving in with the Stewarts, the appellant had been hospitalized for a few days in December 2003 under a mental health warrant.&nbsp; In her testimony, Ms. Stewart described the appellant as having “developmental disabilities”.&nbsp; He was “a little awkward socially” and had “a difficult time obtaining and keeping jobs” (A.R., at p. 107).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated, the murder weapon turned out to be a rifle the appellant had recently stolen from his uncle’s farm.&nbsp; To avoid detection, the appellant had modified the rifle by cutting off its wooden stock.&nbsp; He and his friend Michael Stewart fired the gun on a few occasions before the shooting incident.&nbsp; The appellant concealed the weapon under his coat whenever he carried it in and out of the Stewart residence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening of the murder, the appellant and Michael Stewart consumed some beer at home and then headed to a nearby field to shoot the gun. Instead of going to the field, they decided to go to a local bar.&nbsp; The appellant concealed the rifle under his coat so that he could take it inside.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While at the bar, the appellant consumed more beer.&nbsp; He would later testify that his level of sobriety changed from “tipsy” to “more so, more drunk or intoxicated” over the course of the evening (A.R., at pp. 148 and 150).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A bartender noticed that the appellant was hiding something under his coat and confronted him.&nbsp; The appellant denied the allegation but then said that he was concealing a “pellet gun” (A.R., at p. 153).&nbsp; The appellant was told to leave the gun outside and he agreed to do so.&nbsp; Upon his return, the appellant walked up to the bar and opened his coat to show that the gun was no longer there.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was asked to leave the bar a second time because the staff believed he was disturbing some female patrons.&nbsp; The appellant protested but left without incident.&nbsp; He retrieved his rifle and went to a local convenience store where he purchased and ate a hamburger.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Minutes later, he went back to the bar, allegedly in search of Michael Stewart.&nbsp; This time, when he entered the bar, his demeanour was different.&nbsp; He was pacing back and forth.&nbsp; One witness said he seemed nervous.&nbsp; Another testified he appeared “stunned” and had a “blank” look on his face (A.R., at p. 84).&nbsp; The appellant readily admitted at trial that he was “nervous” when he returned to the bar for the third time (A.R., at p. 158): he knew that he was carrying the gun despite having been told that he was not allowed to have it in the bar.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">A bartender noticed the appellant and escorted him out of the bar when he refused to leave.&nbsp; Mr. Shuckburgh and another employee assisted with the removal.&nbsp; In the process, the gun fell from the appellant’s coat as he crossed the doorway.&nbsp; The appellant grabbed the gun with both hands.&nbsp; Cradling the barrel in his left hand and placing his right hand around the trigger at waist level, he pointed the rifle at Mr. Shuckburgh and the two employees. &nbsp;He slowly started backing down a ramp towards the street, while the bar personnel kept advancing toward him, telling him to </span><span style="line-height:200%">“get out of here” (A.R., at p. 40)</span><span style="line-height:200%">.&nbsp; </span>The appellant later testified that he was not planning to use the rifle: he just wanted to scare the three men who were after him. He said he was getting increasingly “nervous” and “more scared” and worried that Mr. Shuckburgh might find out where he lived and hurt him (A.R., at p. 168).<span style="line-height:200%"> </span></p>

At one point, the appellant rested his rifle on the top of a wall, sniper-style, turned it at one of the employees and said “stern[ly]”:&nbsp; “This isn’t just a BB gun” (A.R., at p. 40).&nbsp; The appellant later testified that he did so in order to scare the bar staff.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the appellant eventually started moving back towards the bottom of the ramp, Mr. Shuckburgh continued to walk towards him.&nbsp; By this time, the two other bar employees had fallen back, leaving Mr. Shuckburgh in front facing the appellant.&nbsp; One of the two employees testified that the appellant would not step back unless Mr. Shuckburgh took a step forward.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that as he moved off the ramp onto a sidewalk, Mr. Shuckburgh began to walk faster towards him.&nbsp; In turn, the appellant stepped back faster.&nbsp; The next thing he knew, the gun “went up . . . and it went off” (A.R., at p. 177).&nbsp; When asked at trial if he intended for the gun to come up, the appellant replied:&nbsp; “I don’t know. I don’t think so.”&nbsp; Asked to explain what happened, he said: “I don’t know. . . . stupid thing went off” (A.R., at p. 178).&nbsp; The appellant testified that his finger pulled the trigger, but that he did not mean for the gun to go off and did not want to shoot anyone.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Ms. Stewart, the appellant initially seemed “dazed” but grew more agitated as he recounted the events that had led to the shooting (A.R., at p. 100).&nbsp; He took out the gun he had been hiding under his coat and began gesturing and waving the muzzle of the gun back and forth.&nbsp; Ms. Stewart testified that the appellant seemed “very upset and very frightened” about what he had done (A.R., at p. 110).&nbsp; At one point, according to Ms. Stewart, the appellant said that “he wanted to kill himself, that he did not want to deal with what the consequences were of this . . . [to] spend years in jail and so on, so he would rather kill himself” (A.R., at p. 104).<b> </b></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">The theory put forward <span style="font-size:11.5pt">by </span>the defence is this: that Adrian Walle, on the night in question, in a nervous, shaky, highly agitated state, at a time when he consumed a certain amount of alcohol, and while being almost continually pursued and advanced upon by a numerically superior force, unintentionally discharged that .22 [rifle] at a time when it was pointed at Jeffrey Shuckburgh.&nbsp; [A.R., at pp. 198-99]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In urging the trial judge to find that the discharge of the gun was unintentional, defence counsel said that “Mr. Walle, at the time when his finger pressed that trigger, did not mean to pull that trigger” (A.R., at p. 212).&nbsp; In response to a question from the trial judge, defence counsel clarified his position as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Again, the only possible explanation is there was . . . a physical mechanical malfunction of the person of Mr. Walle, that his finger pulled the trigger, but without the brain actively telling the finger to pull the trigger.&nbsp; <u>There was a lack of communication between the brain and the finger.</u> &nbsp;[Emphasis added; A.R., at p. 212.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a later point in his submissions, defence counsel noted that in assessing the issue of intent, the trial judge was obliged to consider “all the circumstances surrounding this [event]” (A.R., at p. 217).&nbsp; In that regard, one of the factors to be considered was the appellant’s alcohol consumption that night.&nbsp; According to defence counsel, however, the appellant was not “drunk”, nor had he “reached a state of intoxication that made him incapable of forming intent”.&nbsp; As such, the appellant’s alcohol consumption was insufficient of itself to warrant a finding of manslaughter.&nbsp; It was simply “something that goes into the mix” (A.R., at p. 217).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel further suggested that the appellant’s “highly agitated” emotional state as he was being pursued by the three men from the bar could also have resulted in unintentional discharge (A.R., at p. 217).&nbsp; According to counsel, the appellant is “a man who, at levels of agitation, gets jerky, gets spasmodic, gets mobile with his hands” (A.R., at p. 218) — as evidenced during his testimony on the witness stand.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking these factors into account, defence counsel submitted, it was at least possible that “this was an unintentional discharge” and that the appellant “never meant to pull that trigger and shoot Jeff Shuckburgh or anyone else” (A.R., at p. 218).&nbsp; Hence, the appellant should be found guilty of manslaughter, not murder.</p>

In particular, no evidence was directed at whether in shooting the deceased in the chest at close range, the appellant was aware of — and thus can be said to have intended — the consequences that were likely to follow from his action.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[41]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That leads me to one of the main problems I have with this appeal, at least in so far as the first issue is concerned.&nbsp; The appellant’s primary position at trial was that there was a miscommunication between his brain and his finger, such that while he did pull the trigger, he did not “mean” to do so (the “unintentional discharge theory”).&nbsp; While the appellant relied on this theory at trial, he improperly characterized it as going to the specific<i> </i>intent required for murder.&nbsp; In fact, the appellant was really claiming that his act of pulling the trigger was involuntary.&nbsp; The trial judge rejected the appellant’s theory as unworthy of belief, and the appellant does not pursue it here.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[42]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant’s focus has shifted.&nbsp; He now claims that the trial judge failed to consider evidence bearing on his mental state on the night of the shooting, such as his developmental delays and alcohol consumption, in assessing whether he was aware of the consequences of shooting Mr. Shuckburgh — and thus possessed one or the other of the specific intents for murder.&nbsp; That is a far cry from the position he took at trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have explained, at trial, the appellant did not suggest that his mental state prevented him from knowing the consequences that were likely to follow upon shooting someone in the chest at close range — nor could he, realistically.&nbsp; The evidence pointed overwhelmingly in the opposite direction.&nbsp; By way of illustration, moments before the shooting, the appellant made it clear to his pursuers that the gun he was holding was not “just a BB gun” (A.R., at p. 40) — a comment that showed that he was aware of his earlier false description of the gun at the bar and equally aware that the weapon he was holding was a lethal weapon.&nbsp; As well, shortly after the shooting incident, the appellant talked about killing himself with the very weapon he had just used to kill Mr. Shuckburgh so as to avoid facing the consequences of what he had done.&nbsp; Not long after that, at the police station, he asked a police officer to kill him with his service revolver.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, nowhere in his submissions to the trial judge did defence counsel argue that the appellant was unaware of the consequences of his actions.&nbsp; That is important because it places in focus the appellant’s present complaint, namely, that in relying on the “common sense inference” to find intent, the trial judge failed to consider all of the evidence bearing on the appellant’s mental state at the time of the shooting.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant’s evidence about his developmental delays is based on Ms. Stewart’s testimony.&nbsp; Ms. Stewart testified as a lay witness.&nbsp; Her evidence did not address the issue of the appellant’s intent and, more particularly, what impact, if any, the appellant’s “developmental delays” may have had on his awareness of the consequences of firing a bullet into someone’s chest at close range.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the appellant’s hospitalization on a mental health warrant is equally unhelpful.&nbsp; No evidence was led at trial as to the nature of the health problem or what impact, if any, it may have had on the appellant’s mental state at the time of the shooting.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s “blank” affect at the bar, as described by one witness, is of little import.&nbsp; The appellant himself admitted to being nervous when he entered the bar for the third time, knowing that he had the gun concealed under his coat.&nbsp; His own evidence shows that he was aware of what he was doing and very much alive to the potential consequences of his actions.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[50]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the appellant’s hand gestures while testifying and the evidence that he was waving the gun around before it discharged, the trial judge was clearly aware of these features.&nbsp; They related directly to the appellant’s primary, if not singular, defence that his act of pulling the trigger was involuntary and that the discharge of the gun was therefore unintentional.&nbsp; The trial judge considered and rejected the appellant’s “unintentional discharge” theory.&nbsp; He found the appellant to be not credible.&nbsp; Accordingly, the appellant was not entitled to have the same evidence taken into account by the trial judge in his assessment of the appellant’s awareness of the consequences of firing a gun at close range into someone’s chest.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge considered the evidence of the appellant’s alcohol consumption and found that it did not leave him in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant knew that death would likely result if he shot the deceased in the chest at close range.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, none of the evidence that the appellant points to could have assisted him at trial on the issue of his awareness of the consequences of firing a gun into a person’s chest at close range.&nbsp; Thus, while it might have been preferable had the trial judge referred specifically to the items of evidence that the appellant has identified, he was not obliged to do so any more than he was obliged to refer to all of the evidence that pointed in the opposite direction — of which there was a good deal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered the salient features of the evidence that could have impacted on the appellant’s awareness of the consequences of his actions.&nbsp; In the end, the trial judge was left in no doubt that the appellant was anything other than fully aware of the fatal consequences that were likely to follow when he pulled the trigger.&nbsp; Only then did the trial judge revert to the “common sense inference” as a basis for finding that the appellant had the requisite intent for second degree murder.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I propose to address the CLA’s concerns relatively briefly, as they do not bear directly on the case at hand, where there was no jury.&nbsp; To the extent they arise at all, they do so only tangentially.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[57]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thrust of the CLA’s submission is found at para. 11 of its factum as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases where there is an air of reality to the suggestion that impairment (by intoxication or otherwise) contributed to the accused’s actions, an instruction which incorporates a “sane and sober” common sense inference should <u>never</u> be given.&nbsp; There is a real danger that juries will misuse the inference to incorporate objective <i>mens rea</i> into a specific intent offence and fail to focus on the accused’s actual intention at the time of his actions.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, the CLA’s argument runs counter to this Court’s recent decision in <i>R. v. Daley</i>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, in which we reaffirmed the relevance of the common sense inference in particular circumstances.&nbsp; The facts of that case are straightforward.&nbsp; Daley killed his wife after a night of heavy drinking and was charged with first degree murder.&nbsp; At trial, Daley maintained that, as a result of his alcohol consumption, he had no recollection of the events surrounding the death of his wife.&nbsp; He defended the charge of murder on the basis that he lacked the requisite intent by virtue of his alcohol consumption.&nbsp; Daley led expert evidence in support of his position.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his charge, the trial judge instructed the jury on the common sense inference about which the CLA now complains.&nbsp; He also cautioned the jury that they could draw the inference only after considering all of the evidence, including the evidence of the appellant’s alcohol consumption.&nbsp; The jury convicted Daley of second degree murder.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this Court, one of the issues raised by Daley was whether the trial judge should have gone further than he did in explaining to the jury why the common sense inference might not apply in that case, given his high degree of intoxication.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 104 of his reasons for the majority, Bastarache J. reinforced this Court’s admonition in <i>R. v. Seymour</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 252, that it was incumbent on trial judges to link the common sense inference to the evidence of intoxication.&nbsp; Bastarache J. then made the following observations about the common sense inference:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:58.3pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that <u>it will be necessary to instruct the jury on the common sense inference in most cases, for it assists the jury in understanding how they are to conclude whether or not there was the necessary intent</u>:&nbsp; see <i>Seymour</i>, at para. 19.&nbsp; So long as the members of the jury are instructed that they are not bound to draw this inference, particularly in light of the evidence of intoxication . . . I find nothing objectionable about instructions on the common sense inference.&nbsp; I do not think the trial judge must take pains to tell the jury they are not bound to draw the inference where there is evidence of a significant degree of intoxication, as this is a matter of common sense.&nbsp; In this respect, I approve of the comments made by Huddart J.A. in <i>R. v. Courtereille </i>(2001), 40 C.R. (5th) 338 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 32:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:85.7pt;text-indent:-85.7pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [The common sense inference] does not die with the first drink.&nbsp; The collective common sense and knowledge of life possessed by twelve jurors is of fundamental importance to the unique value of juries. . . .&nbsp; It is equally good sense and common experience that the effect of alcohol on thought processes is a continuum. . . .&nbsp; The more intoxicated a person becomes, the greater the likelihood that drink will result first in uninhibited conduct, and ultimately in unintended conduct.&nbsp; It is proper to remind the jury that they may use their common sense with respect to this, even if intoxication is advanced, provided the reminder includes the admonition that the inference is permissive and subject to a consideration of the evidence of intoxication.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 104.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the face of this Court’s recent pronouncement in <i>Daley</i>, I see no reason — and the CLA has provided none — for instituting the black and white “thou shalt never” rule the CLA is advocating for jury instructions in cases where the accused might be impaired.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, instructing a jury on the common sense inference serves a useful purpose.&nbsp; It provides the jury with a marker against which to measure the rather amorphous concept of intent.&nbsp; A proper instruction also sounds a cautionary note.&nbsp; The jurors are admonished that the inference is permissive, not presumptive, and that before acting on it, they must carefully consider the evidence that points away from it.&nbsp; That is important.&nbsp; Left to its own devices, a jury might too readily turn to common sense for an answer, especially in cases like the present one, where common sense might suggest that anyone who fires a gun into a person’s chest at close range would surely be aware of the consequences.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I do not mean to suggest that the common sense inference instruction should be tied to a rigid formula.&nbsp; Thus, by way of example, while trial judges may choose to refer to the “sane and sober” person when instructing a jury on the common sense inference, they need not do so.&nbsp; A simple instruction along the lines that “a person usually knows what the predictable consequences of his or her actions are, and means to bring them about”, would suffice.&nbsp; (See Canadian Judicial Council, <i>Model Jury Instructions</i> (2012) (online), at <i>Homicide</i>, Offence 229.a, at para. 6.)</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, there was no jury.&nbsp; Instead, as discussed above, the trial judge considered the pertinent evidence of alcohol consumption and found that it did not leave him in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant knew that death would likely result if he shot the deceased in the chest at close range.&nbsp; Only then did the trial judge apply the common sense inference in finding that the appellant had the necessary intent for murder.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the fresh evidence that the appellant now seeks to tender would not have been of assistance to him on his trial before Hart J.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%"><i>Asperger’s disorder</i>:&nbsp; The Asperger’s disorder falls on the higher end of functioning among autism spectrum disorders.&nbsp; The appellant’s IQ is low average.&nbsp; In the appellant’s case, this disorder manifests itself in the appellant’s impaired social interaction, such as his poor use of non-verbal cues, difficulty establishing relationships, preoccupation with certain things like smoking and firearms, as well as repetitive motor mannerisms like facial hair stroking, head jerking, and mouth gestures.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%"><i>Paranoid personality disorder</i>:&nbsp; The appellant is extremely suspicious that others are exploiting or deceiving him and reads demeaning or threatening messages into benign remarks and events.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%"><i>Intermittent explosive disorder</i>:&nbsp; The appellant has difficulty resisting aggressive impulses, where the resultant aggression is grossly out of proportion to any precipitating stressors.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%"><i>Adult antisocial behaviour</i>:&nbsp; The appellant engages in antisocial behaviour and holds antisocial attitudes, but does not meet the full criteria for this disorder.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%"><i>Alcohol abuse disorder</i>:&nbsp; There is a pattern of alcohol abuse suggestive of a disorder, as the appellant’s alcohol consumption has caused impairment in social, occupational, and relationship functioning.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:81.35pt;text-indent:-81.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases:&nbsp; see <i>McMartin v. The Queen</i>, [1964] S.C.R. 484.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.75in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Due Diligence</u></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[78]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that will become apparent, my decision to reject the proposed fresh evidence does not turn on the due diligence component.&nbsp; I must say, however, that this case is an egregious example of non-compliance.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the appellant’s trial before Hart J. in 2008 (his second trial on this matter), the psychiatric evidence that he now proposes to introduce as fresh evidence on this appeal was, in substance, available to him — and yet, for reasons unexplained, he made no attempt to lead that evidence on the trial proper.&nbsp; Rather, he chose to introduce it at the sentencing hearing.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same holds true in respect of the appellant’s first trial on this matter which occurred in 2005 and ended in a conviction for manslaughter.&nbsp; (That verdict was later overturned on a Crown appeal and a new trial — ultimately resulting in the present appeal — was ordered.)&nbsp; Notably, at his sentencing hearing for the offence of manslaughter, the appellant had introduced psychiatric evidence that for all intents and purposes mirrors the evidence he now seeks to tender as fresh evidence on this appeal.&nbsp; The appellant made no effort to introduce that evidence on the trial proper.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had long been suspected of suffering from Asperger’s disorder, and medical professionals had noted his social difficulties, aggressiveness, fascination with guns and problems with alcohol for a very long time even if they had stopped short of diagnosing him with this specific disorder.&nbsp; There is no reason why the appellant could not have adduced these prior medical opinions before Hart J. at his second trial.&nbsp; Nor is there any reason why he could not have obtained and adduced a comprehensive report like the one Dr. Duska prepared ahead of his second sentencing hearing.&nbsp; Indeed, he had such a report available to him.&nbsp; It had been prepared by Dr. Singh in 2005 for sentencing purposes following the appellant’s conviction for manslaughter at his first trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is true that Dr. Singh’s report did not specifically mention Asperger’s disorder, it did refer to virtually all of the symptoms identified in Dr.&nbsp;Duska’s report.&nbsp; Thus, apart from the new labelling of the symptoms as Asperger’s disorder, I see little in the supposedly “new” evidence contained in Dr. Duska’s report that could not have been adduced at the appellant’s trial, had the appellant and his counsel thought it helpful.&nbsp; And, as we shall see, there are grounds to think that the evidence might have been unhelpful.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This failure to adduce the evidence at trial weighs heavily against its admission in this Court.&nbsp; That said, I would not let it stand in the way of admission if I were otherwise satisfied that the proposed evidence could reasonably be expected to have affected the result at trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But that is not the case.&nbsp; Despite the appellant’s submissions to the contrary, I am not at all persuaded that the proposed evidence, when taken together with the other evidence adduced at trial, could reasonably be expected to have affected the result.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.75in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Could the Proposed Fresh Evidence Reasonably Be Expected to Have Affected the Result at Trial?</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main failing of the proposed fresh evidence is that nowhere does Dr. Duska suggest that the appellant, by virtue of his diagnosed disorders, may not have been aware of the consequences that were likely to follow upon shooting someone in the chest at close range.&nbsp; Indeed, Dr. Duska’s report could be read to offer an explanation for the appellant’s conduct in shooting the deceased, namely, a symptom of his intermittent explosive disorder that manifests itself in a “failure to resist aggressive impulses that result in serious assaultive acts” (see p. 8 of Dr.&nbsp;Duska’s report).&nbsp; In other words, the report indicates that the appellant gives in to his aggressive impulses where other persons would not.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If Dr. Duska was of the view that the appellant’s disorders may have impacted on his awareness of the consequences of firing a gun into a person’s chest at close range, he could have prepared a report to that effect and filed it on this appeal.&nbsp; He did not do so.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did Dr. Duska provide additional information that may have shed light on the “unintentional discharge” theory that the appellant advanced at trial. Nothing in Dr. Duska’s report lends credence to the appellant’s contention that there was a disconnect between the appellant’s brain and his finger that resulted in an involuntary pulling of the trigger.&nbsp; The evidence indicates that the appellant exhibits repetitive motor mannerisms, or what might colloquially be called a “tic” (e.g., facial hair stroking, head jerking).&nbsp; But there is no indication that he cannot control his index finger or that he might have involuntarily used his finger to apply the more than six pounds of pressure required to shoot his gun on the night of the shooting.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the appellant’s alcohol consumption issue, it tells us nothing about his degree of impairment on the night in question.&nbsp; The trial judge, as discussed, did consider the evidence of the appellant’s intoxication and found that it did not raise a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s intent.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, I see no basis for concluding that Dr. Duska’s evidence could have raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant voluntarily shot his gun, or as to whether he possessed the requisite intent for murder.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appellant’s motion to introduce fresh evidence.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Conclusion</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, as I have explained, made no error in his analysis or conclusion.&nbsp; I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.</p>
