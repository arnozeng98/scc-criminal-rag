   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Accused was convicted of having in his possession an outboard motor knowing it to have been “obtained by the commission of an indictable offence”. On the accused’s appeal, the Crown sought to have the information amended—to read “derived indirectly from” rather than “obtained by”—to conform to the evidence and to affirm the conviction. As the evidence did not support the charge, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial on the amended information.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(McIntyre and Lamer JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Laskin C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Chouinard JJ.: An appellate court would require the clearest statutory basis to materially amend the information and uphold a conviction based on the information as amended. There was no such clear statutory basis in this case, but justice could be done by following the course adopted by the Court of Appeal, <i>i.e. </i>to allow the appeal (s. 613(1)(<i>a</i>)), order a new trial (s. 613(2)(<i>b</i>)) and make any order that justice requires (s. 613(8)), including an order directing a new trial on the amended information.

   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">McIntyre and Lamer JJ., <i>dissenting in part: </i>While appellate courts may order a new trial on an amended charge, they should not use their discretion to assist the Crown in overcoming the effect of its prosecutorial shortcomings to the detriment of the accused by ordering a second trial where the first has failed solely through Crown’s error.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought as of right by the Attorney General for the Province of Ontario from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for that Province pursuant to the provisions of s. 621(1)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>which read as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">621.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under section&nbsp;603 or 604 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph 605(1)(<i>a</i>) or subsection&nbsp;605(3), the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada</span></p>

   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 487]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">…did have in his possession a 150 horsepower mercury outboard motor, of a value exceeding two hundred dollars, knowing it to have been <i>obtained by </i>the commission in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> of an indictable offence</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">CONTRARY TO SECTION&nbsp;312 Subsection&nbsp;(a) OF THE CRIMINAL CODE.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">(Emphasis is mine.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of the Court of Appeal for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Ontario</span><span lang="EN-CA"> allowing the respondent’s appeal from this conviction provided as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">THIS COURT DID ORDER that the said appeal should be and the same was thereby allowed and that the Information should be and the same was thereby amended, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed on the amended Information.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The question of law upon which Mr.&nbsp;Justice Jessup founded his dissent is expressed in the Notice of Appeal in the following terms:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Did the majority of the Court of Appeal for the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Province of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Ontario</span><span lang="EN-CA"> err in law in holding that it had no power, where there was a variance between the evidence led at trial and the allegation contained in the information, to amend the information to conform to the evidence, to affirm the conviction and to dismiss the appeal?</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The “variance between the evidence led at trial and the allegation contained in the information” is founded on the conclusion unanimously reached by the Court of Appeal that the evidence at trial did not support a finding that the outboard motor which was found in the respondent’s possession had been <i>obtained </i>by the commission of an indictable offence but rather that it could, at worst, be said to have been <i>“derived directly or indirectly” </i>from the commission in Canada of such an offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The distinction to be drawn between having possession of something knowing it to have been obtained by the commission of an indictable offence and having such possession knowing that the article was derived directly or indirectly from the commission of such an offence is illustrated by the following passage from the reasons for judgment rendered by Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the case of <i>R.v. MacKenzie</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 488]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">released October 15, 1975. Mr.&nbsp;Justice Martin there said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">We are all of the view that the word ‘obtained’ in the section, refers to things that constitute the subject-matter of the crime by which they were obtained. For example, things obtained by theft, false pretences or extortion. The offence must be committed in respect of the thing obtained. Money, of course, constitutes ‘anything’ within the meaning of section&nbsp;312. Money, however, which has been knowingly and voluntarily paid by a purchaser to a vendor, with respect to an illegal transaction, which constitutes an indictable offence, is not ‘obtained’ by such indictable offence within the meaning of section&nbsp;312. The offence committed in the offence of trafficking in a narcotic drug, or a controlled drug, is not in respect of the property transferred as the consideration for the illegal transaction, but against the public welfare, in the interests of which the transaction is made criminal. The fact that money was derived from the commission of a crime does not necessarily constitute an ‘obtaining’ of the money by the crime, within the meaning of section&nbsp;312.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This case was followed by the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975</i>,<i> </i>1974-75-76 (</span><span lang="EN-CA">Can.</span><span lang="EN-CA">), c. 93, s. 29 which reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">312.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) Every one commits an offence who has in his possession any property or thing or any proceeds of any property or thing knowing that all or part of the property or thing or of the proceeds was obtained by or derived directly or indirectly from</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>the commission in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> of an offence punishable by indictment;…</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The facts of this case are not seriously in dispute and they are concisely summarized in the dissenting reasons for judgment of Mr.&nbsp;Justice Jessup which were in this regard adopted by the majority of the Court of Appeal. Mr.&nbsp;Justice Jessup there said [at p. 78]:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">Three men entered into a conspiracy for two of them to take the outboard motor from the third who was its owner and the owner then falsely claimed against his insurer for loss by theft. The two who had taken the motor sold it to the appellant and the learned trial Judge found that the appellant knew of the scheme at the time of the sale.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 489]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In fact the trial judge found that Geauvreau knew how the outboard motor had been acquired at the time when he made the purchase and moreover that he knew “exactly what the deal was”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It was the submission of the Crown before the Court of Appeal and before this Court that the information should be amended “to allege that the appellant was in possession of an outboard motor knowing that it was derived indirectly from the commission in Canada of an indictable offence”, and it was further submitted that the Court of Appeal should affirm the conviction based on the amended information. It is this submission which gave rise to the dissenting judgment of Mr.&nbsp;Justice Jessup and it must in my view be examined in light of the proposition stated by Mr.&nbsp;Justice Zuber on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal [at p. 84]:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is part of our law of criminal procedure that a person accused of crime is entitled to know the charge against him, whether contained in an information or an indictment, in reasonably specific terms and he is tried on that charge. This principle retains its vitality even though the formalism of an earlier era has been diminished and trial Courts now possess reasonably wide powers of amendment. However, even though criminal procedure has become less technical and more flexible, the concept of an amendment at an appellate stage involves difficult considerations. An amendment at trial contemplates a continuing ability by the accused to meet an amended charge; the appellate stage occurs long after the evidence has been led, arguments made and facts found. In my view, it would be an extraordinary step for an appellate Court to materially amend the charge and uphold a conviction based on the charge as amended. I would think that such an extraordinary step would require the clearest statutory basis.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is however further contended on behalf of the Crown that the amendment sought in the present case is a mere alteration in a particular of the offence and as to this contention I agree that the source of the property and the manner by which it was acquired relate only to the mode of the commission of the offence, but, as Mr.&nbsp;Justice Zuber has observed [at p. 85]:</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 490]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">…the possession of property by itself is not an offence. The Crown must allege as a necessary element of its case the unlawful source of the goods. In the information as drawn in this case the allegation that the motor was ‘obtained by the commission in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> of an indictable offence’ is an essential averment. The Crown now seeks to delete that essential averment and substitute another, <i>i.e. </i>‘derived indirectly from the commission of an indictable offence’.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In this latter regard the Crown seeks to rely on the provisions of s. 610(3) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and this also forms the basis of the dissenting judgment of Mr.&nbsp;Justice Jessup. That section&nbsp;reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(3) A court of appeal may exercise in relation to proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in subsection&nbsp;(1) that may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters, and may issue any process that is necessary to enforce the orders or sentences of the court but no costs shall be allowed to the appellant or respondent…</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section&nbsp;610 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>is primarily concerned with evidentiary questions and the following passage taken from the dissenting judgment of Chief Justice Laskin in <i>Elliott v. The Queen</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 393 at p. 409 reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am unable to accept the view that s. 610(3) confers any power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment. That subsection&nbsp;takes its context from the preceding provisions of s. 610 which concern evidentiary questions. The opening words of s. 610(3) show its limited range; they provide that ‘A court of appeal may exercise…any powers not mentioned in subsection&nbsp;(1) that may be exercised…on appeals in civil matters’. The subsection&nbsp;cannot, therefore, be read as if it was a detached and separate provision. Although Wilson J.A. purported to find support for his view in this Court’s judgment in <i>Kissick v. The King </i>[1952] 1 S.C.R. 343, that case was concerned with an issue as to admissibility of evidence and thus related to the very subject-matter of s. 610. Still less can s. 610(3) be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a different charge from the one on which the case came before it.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">While the above quotation is taken from a dissenting opinion, it constitutes a thorough and authoritative statement of the true meaning to be attached to the provisions of s. 610(3) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and it is to be noted that it covers a</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 491]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">facet of the appeal in the case there in question which was expressly left open in the reasons for judgment of the majority of this Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am further in agreement with the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal in holding that the present circumstances fall to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of s. 613 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>and like Mr.&nbsp;Justice Zuber, I find it desirable to reproduce hereunder the relevant portions of that section&nbsp;which reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">613.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3"><span lang="EN-CA">(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation3" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-CA">…</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under paragraph (1)(<i>a</i>), it shall quash the conviction and</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered, or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>) order a new trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span lang="EN-CA">…</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the powers conferred by subsection&nbsp;(2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in addition, that justice requires.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown sought to have the information amended to conform to the evidence and thereafter to affirm the conviction and, as I have indicated, the dissenting opinion of Mr.&nbsp;Justice Jessup is to the same effect. To follow this course would be to take what Mr.&nbsp;Justice Zuber in my opinion properly referred to as “an extraordinary step” which “would require the clearest statutory basis”.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I can find no such clear statutory basis in this case but I am satisfied that justice can be done by</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 492]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">following the course adopted by the majority of the Court of Appeal which was to quash the conviction, allow the appeal and order a new trial pursuant to the authority contained in s. 613(1)(<i>a</i>) and s. 613(2)(<i>b</i>) and <i>thereafter</i>,<i> </i>pursuant to the authority contained in s. 613(8) to make any order that justice requires including in the present case an order directing a new trial on the amended information. This procedure ensures that the accused is informed of the charge against him before his trial commences and provides him with a continuing opportunity to meet the amended charge as the trial progresses.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">For all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The reasons of McIntyre and Lamer JJ. were delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">LAMER J. (<i>dissenting in part</i>)—I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Ritchie. I am in agreement with his comments as regards ss. 312(1) and 610(3) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>I also agree with the Court of Appeal for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Ontario</span><span lang="EN-CA"> and with the reasons given by that Court set out in my brother Ritchie’s opinion that the conviction should be quashed. I would, however, allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal for a new trial and enter a verdict of acquittal. I would have agreed to the ordering of a new trial on an amended information had the trial judge denied a Crown’s motion to that effect. However such did not occur as the Crown did not seek an amendment from the trial court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The trial judge’s error was in convicting the accused as charged since the evidence could not support the essential averment that the outboard motor had “been <u>obtained</u> by the commission in </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> of an indictable offence”. (My underlining). The Crown’s failure to seek to cure the defect in its information at trial should in my view inure to the benefit of the accused. While appellate courts should correct judicial errors on appeal it is not generally their function to assist the Crown in overcoming the effect of its prosecutorial short-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 493]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">comings to the detriment of accused by ordering a second trial where the first has failed solely through error of the Crown. While this Court’s decision in <i>Elliott v. The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1978] 2 S.C.R.&nbsp;393, has recognized that appellate courts may order a new trial on an amended charge, provided that it not be tantamount to charging a different offence, it is a matter of discretion which, for the aforementioned reasons, I should choose to exercise by entering a verdict of acquittal in the stead of a new trial on the amended information.</span></p> 
   <p class="Disposition"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Appeal dismissed, MCINTYRE and LAMER JJ. dissenting in part.</span></i></p> 
   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">Solicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General for </span><span lang="EN-CA">Ontario</span><span lang="EN-CA">, </span><span lang="EN-CA">Toronto</span><span lang="EN-CA">.</span></p>
