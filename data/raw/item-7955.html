Finally, I agree that the trial judge’s misapprehension of the evidence is therefore fatal to her verdict. </span></p>

Its concern is whether it can be seen from the reasons for judgment that the trial judge’s conclusion ― that is to say, the judge’s <i>verdict </i>― was reached illogically or irrationally. As Justice Charron puts it, <i>Beaudry</i> is concerned with “fundamental flaws in the reasoning process that led to [the trial judge’s verdict]” (para. 77).</span></p>

This, along with evidence that the three accused were out of the house at the same time and other apparently incriminating circumstantial evidence, satisfied the trial judge that Mr. Sinclair was guilty of manslaughter (paras. 21-22). </span></p>

Their reasons, in this country at least, are forever shrouded in the compelled secrecy of their deliberations: <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec649" target="_blank">Section 649<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>prohibits the disclosure, subject only to narrow exceptions, of any information relating to the proceedings of a jury.

And evaluating the reasonableness of those reasons is not a matter of speculation. Moreover, while the necessary degree of detail will vary according to the circumstances of the case, the reasons must be sufficient to permit meaningful review on appeal. There would be no need for this requirement if the sole test of unreasonableness under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) is whether there is any evidence capable of supporting the verdict.

The issue in that case was whether the accused had the specific intent to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice when he decided not to take the breath samples needed to charge a fellow officer. In concluding that he did, the trial judge relied on evidence which in my view demonstrated that Mr. Beaudry did <i>not </i>seek to conceal the offence and did <i>not </i>wish to foreclose the possibility of prosecution (para. 111). Accordingly, I found that the judge’s inference that Mr. Beaudry intended to obstruct justice was plainly contradicted by the very evidence from which it was drawn and that his verdict was therefore “unreasonable” within the meaning of s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i). </span></p>

Here, an essential inference that appears compatible with the evidence from which it is drawn implodes on contextual scrutiny. This is so where a trial judge infers from <i>some</i> of the available evidence that an accused had the requisite intent to obstruct justice and this inference is supportable on the evidence relied upon but is not supportable on consideration of other evidence that has been neither contradicted by other evidence nor rejected by the trial judge. Here, too, a verdict of guilt “would lack legitimacy and would properly . . . be treated as ‘unreasonable’” (<i>ibid.</i>). </span></p>

A majority of the B.C. Court of Appeal affirmed the convictions. Hollinrake J.A. dissented.

(3d) 193</span>, as follows at p. 221:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the same paragraph, Doherty J.A. stated:</span></p>

This is so even if the evidence, as actually adduced at trial, was capable of supporting a conviction.</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with these observations.

[para. 1]</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The decisive error identified by the Court of Appeal in this case falls squarely within <i>Lohrer</i>, and the court applied the <i>Lohrer</i> test explicitly and correctly, notably at paras. 94-97 of its extensive and unanimous reasons:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge appears to have accepted that there was evidence that Sinclair and the other two planned to go out together to commit another robbery. She said that there was evidence that they were out together. She described [these] matters as evidentiary, when they were not. As has been explained above, this was more than factual findings based on inference; this amounted to a mischaracterization or misapprehension of the evidence. </span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" align="center" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:
center;text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">. . .</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the judge treated as evidentiary that which was not, she did not consider inferences, other than that the three men were out together, that were available to be drawn on the evidence. For example, there was evidence, particularly of Audy relating to the potential use of the phone at the store, that could have led the judge to a different inference about Sinclair’s whereabouts and involvement.</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, these mischaracterizations [in essence, misapprehensions of the evidence] were not on peripheral points. As stated by Binnie, J., for the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Lohrer</i> . . . (at para. 2): “The misapprehension of the evidence must go to the substance rather than to the detail. It must be material rather than peripheral to the reasoning of the trial judge.” It was obviously a fundamental question whether Sinclair was at the scene of the crime. The two “evidentiary” matters, among other evidence, on which the judge relied to establish that he was indeed at the scene were essential to her ultimate verdict. It cannot be stated with confidence that, had she not mischaracterized the evidence, she would have found as she did.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">I believe it important to add that the Court of Appeal, in ordering a new trial, took care to recall expressly that “[a]ppellate courts should not parse and dissect reasons of trial judges as if under a microscope” (para. 72). I agree, of course. In my respectful view, care must likewise be taken not to attribute to a single word in the reasons of the Court of Appeal a fatal significance divorced from its context and contrary to its literal and ordinary meaning.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The Court of Appeal was troubled, as am I, by the trial judge’s “apparent acceptance . . . that there was evidence of Sinclair, Pruden-Wilson and the young person planning to go out together to commit another robbery” (para. 61). According to the <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i> (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 61, the primary meaning of “apparent” is “readily visible or perceivable”. And, in this sense, the judge’s error is indeed apparent ― not speculative, or even imputed by inference.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">After noting the Crown’s submission that circumstantial evidence established Mr. Sinclair’s participation in the assault of the victim, the trial judge states: “The Crown refers to <u>the evidence that, prior to the assault, Pruden-Wilson, Sinclair and the youth planned to go out together to commit another robbery</u>” (para. 21 (emphasis added)). With respect for those who read this sentence differently, it seems plain to me that the Court of Appeal’s reference to the trial judge’s “apparent acceptance” of this “evidence” is entirely grounded in the trial judge’s own words. It is, I repeat, hardly “speculative”: It aptly describes an <i>actual mistake</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[35]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Moreover, this mistaken view of the evidence appears from the trial judge’s ensuing reasons to have coloured her evaluation of the other circumstantial evidence upon which the Crown relied. Citing an example, the Court of Appeal explained: “Since the judge treated as evidentiary that which was not, she did not consider inferences, other than that the three men were out together, that were available to be drawn on the evidence” (reproduced above, at para. 31).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The supposed plan of the three accused to commit a robbery ― and to stay together for this purpose throughout the night ― underpinned the judge’s inference that Mr. Sinclair was at the scene of the crime. It was the first step of the reasoning that led her to that conclusion. At no point did the judge state explicitly, or even suggest indirectly, that the “evidence” referred to by the Crown simply did not exist. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">For the sake of clarity, I reproduce the judge’s words once more: “The Crown <u>refers to the evidence</u> that, prior to the assault, Pruden-Wilson, Sinclair and the youth planned to go out together to commit another robbery” (emphasis added). Bearing in mind the plain and ordinary meaning of these words and the context in which they appear, I see no basis for assuming that the trial judge meant “the Crown <u>submits</u>” when she said the “Crown <u>refers to the evidence</u>”. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Finally, and with respect, I am unable to share Justice LeBel’s view (at para. 60) that the evidence established Mr. Sinclair’s participation in the assault or even his presence at the scene when the crime was committed.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">First, there was “no DNA evidence linking [Mr. Sinclair] to the scene” (para. 21 of the trial judge’s reasons). Second, Mr. Sinclair bore no burden to prove that he was not the third “mysterious individual whose identity remains unknown to this day” (para. 60 of Justice LeBel’s reasons). It was for the Crown to prove that he was.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[40]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Third, Mr. Sinclair was not bound to explain the undated cuts in his jeans and lacerations of his legs. The evidence in this regard is inconclusive on its own, and unsupported by forensic evidence of any sort. It is no more probative of Mr. Sinclair’s presence at the scene of the crime than the fact that blood of <i>another accused</i> was on the victim’s knife.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[41]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Fourth, and perhaps most important, mere presence at the scene of the crime ― even if it had been established ― would not suffice to prove, as a matter of fact or matter of law, that Mr. Sinclair had participated in the assault. Indeed, as Crown counsel conceded on the hearing of this appeal, there was evidence that “earlier in the evening, [Mr. Sinclair] had been present but had not participated in another robbery” (transcript, at p. 32). </span></p>

She drew two key inferences to find Mr. Sinclair guilty: (1) that he was at the crime scene; and (2) that he was one of Mr. Lecours’s assailants (2007 MBQB 219, 219 Man. R. (2d) 63).

The record supported this inference even though there was no evidence of a plan to commit a robbery, and the trial judge’s reasoning discloses no mischaracterization of the evidence. With respect, it is inaccurate to state that the trial judge relied on the existence of a plan to commit a robbery to infer that Mr. Sinclair was at the crime scene. Indeed, nowhere in her reasons can support be found for the view that she <i>accepted</i> the Crown’s theory of a planned robbery involving Mr. Sinclair. All she did was to refer to such a plan <i>as part of the Crown’s theory </i>(at para. 21):</span></p>

Rather, the evidence is circumstantial. <u>The Crown submits that the circumstantial evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt Sinclair’s presence at the scene and his involvement in the unlawful act of assaulting Lecours. The Crown refers to the evidence that, prior to the assault, Pruden-Wilson, Sinclair and the youth planned to go out together to commit another robbery.</u> Although nobody saw the three leave 110 Kushner together, there was clearly a period of time, in the early morning hours, when all three were out of the residence. Further, when Sinclair returned to 110 Kushner, he knew that Pruden-Wilson had been stabbed. The Forensic Reports show that Pruden-Wilson’s blood was on Sinclair’s jeans and hoodie. As well, Audy’s evidence was that Sinclair led their subsequent efforts to locate Pruden-Wilson, and Constable Tully testified that Audy and Sinclair were running (and arrested) in the area where Pruden-Wilson was in the snow, bleeding. I am satisfied that the only rational inference to be drawn from all of this evidence is that Sinclair and Pruden-Wilson were together throughout and that Sinclair was at the scene.

Read in context, it does not support a conclusion that the trial judge mistook the Crown’s theory about a planned robbery involving Mr. Sinclair for evidence. Rather, she stated clearly that she inferred that Mr. Sinclair was at the crime scene despite the fact that there was no evidence, such as the simultaneous departure of the three young men, confirming the existence of a plan. In my opinion, the trial judge’s reasons thus indicate that she was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt — regardless of whether the Crown had made out its case with respect to the planned robbery — that Mr. Sinclair was at the crime scene. In the first part of the paragraph quoted above, the trial judge presented some of the Crown’s submissions, while in the second part, she explained how she reached the conclusion that Mr. Sinclair was at the crime scene. The Court of Appeal was not justified in turning the trial judge’s description of a part of the Crown’s theory into an acceptance of its evidentiary foundation.</span></p>

Indeed, Hamilton and Freedman JJ.A. referred to her “<u>apparent acceptance</u> . . . that there was evidence of Sinclair, Pruden-Wilson and the young person planning to go . . . commit another robbery” (para. 61 (emphasis added)). In the absence of an explicit acceptance by the trial judge, the Court of Appeal appears to have “inferred” that her explanation of the basis for her inference was flawed. As a result, the Court of Appeal’s decision to order a new trial in this case rests solely on this implicit, but “apparent”, mistake.</span></p>

O’Brien</i>, 2011 SCC 29, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 485, at para. 16). In my opinion, for an appellate court to decide to order a new trial on the basis of a miscarriage of justice resulting from a misapprehension of the evidence, more is needed than an “apparent” mistake (e.g., an error that the trial judge <i>may</i> have committed) in the reasons. A court of appeal should not, in applying the <i>Lohrer</i> test, order a new trial unless the trial judge has made a real error; its decision cannot be speculative. The plain language or the thrust of the reasons must disclose an actual mistake. When such errors are in fact committed, appellate courts have no difficulty in explaining why they caused the trial judge’s reasoning process to be fatally flawed and where they may be found in the reasons. In such situations, the errors are readily obvious.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>R. v. C.L.Y.</i>, 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, Abella J. observed that in the oft-cited decision in <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), on which the <i>Lohrer</i> test is based, Doherty J.A. had rightly “caution[ed] appellate judges not to dissect, parse, or microscopically examine the reasons of a trial judge” (para.&nbsp;11). With respect, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in the case at bar, which my colleague Fish J. endorses, disregards this cautionary rule. The order for a new trial results from an overly critical reading of the trial judge’s reasons and is not faithful to the thrust of her reasoning. This is illustrated by the fact that neither the Court of Appeal nor Fish J. in this Court has been able to identify a point in the trial judge’s reasons at which she accepted the Crown’s theory that Mr.&nbsp;Sinclair was involved in a plan to commit a robbery, or to satisfactorily explain why this “misapprehension” was central to her reasoning process.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">It is therefore my view that the trial judge did not infer that Mr. Sinclair was at the crime scene on the basis of the “evidence” referred to by the Crown concerning a planned robbery. It is clear from the plain language of her reasons that, after considering all the relevant evidence, including evidence that the individuals were all out of the residence at the time of the assault, that Mr. Sinclair reported that Mr. Pruden-Wilson had been stabbed shortly after it happened, and that Mr. Pruden-Wilson’s blood was found on Mr. Sinclair’s jeans and hoodie, she inferred from this that the three young men had been “together throughout” and that Mr.&nbsp;Sinclair had been at the crime scene.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Even if I were prepared to accept, for the sake of the argument, that the trial judge agreed with the Crown’s theory that Mr. Sinclair had been involved in a plan to commit a robbery, it would nonetheless be my view that the misapprehension was not materially linked to the inference she drew with respect to Mr. Sinclair’s presence at the crime scene. For a misapprehension of evidence to be material within the meaning of the <i>Lohrer </i>test, it must go to a central element of the trial judge’s reasoning on which the conviction is based (<i>Lohrer</i>, at para. 2, <i>per</i> Binnie J.). As Binnie J. correctly stated in <i>Lohrer</i>, the standard described by Doherty J.A. in <i>Morrissey</i> is a stringent one (para. 2). In other words, an error in the assessment of the evidence will amount to a miscarriage of justice only if striking it from the judgment would leave the trial judge’s reasoning on which the conviction is based on unsteady ground.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[57]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In the case at bar, striking the “error” would not have this effect. In light of the circumstantial evidence the trial judge accepted, it cannot seriously be doubted that she would nonetheless have found that Mr. Sinclair was at the crime scene at the time of the assault on Mr. Lecours. In my opinion, if the trial judge could in fact be assumed to have accepted the “evidence” of a plan to commit a robbery, that acceptance would clearly have been incidental to her finding that Mr. Sinclair was at the crime scene. How little importance she attached to the alleged plan to commit a robbery should also come as no surprise: Mr. Sinclair was charged with manslaughter, not with conspiracy to commit robbery. Although evidence of such a plan would likely have strengthened the inference that Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Pruden-Wilson had been “together throughout”, it did not need to be central to the trial judge’s reasoning, because it was not an element of the Crown’s burden.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In his reasons, Fish J. downplays the persuasiveness of the evidence on which the trial judge based the verdict by referring to it as “apparently incriminating circumstantial evidence” (para. 8). In this respect, the fact that Mr.&nbsp;Sinclair reported that Mr. Pruden-Wilson had been stabbed only minutes after it happened and the fact that his clothes were stained with Mr. Pruden-Wilson’s blood are undisputed pieces of evidence that are more than “apparently incriminating”. Furthermore, my colleague’s interpretation of the weight of this circumstantial evidence does not accord with the trial judge’s reasoning. It is important to reflect upon the meaning of the position he has adopted.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In essence, Fish J. suggests that the reasoning process that led the trial judge to convict Mr. Sinclair was dependent upon the “evidence” of a planned robbery. He thus endorses the Court of Appeal’s position that “[i]t cannot be stated with confidence that, had she not mischaracterized the evidence, she would have found as she did” (para. 97). In my respectful view, not only does this position exaggerate the importance of the trial judge’s reference to this planned robbery, but it suggests, erroneously, that had the trial judge not misapprehended the evidence in this regard, she could plausibly have had a reasonable doubt about Mr. Sinclair’s presence at the crime scene.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">This implies that the trial judge might have been inclined to conclude that Mr. Lecours was brutally attacked by three men, including a mysterious individual whose identity remains unknown to this day, and that, for his part, Mr.&nbsp;Sinclair simply happened to fortuitously come across his wounded friend in the minutes following the attack. I have difficulty understanding how she could logically have been inclined to reach such a conclusion. It is even more difficult to understand how that might be if the evidence of Mr. Sinclair’s presence at the crime scene is considered in conjunction with the evidence on which the trial judge relied to infer that he had participated in the assault. In this respect, the evidence accepted by the trial judge shows </span></p>

Nothing in the trial judge’s reasons suggests that she might have been inclined to come to such an illogical conclusion if she had expressly rejected the Crown’s theory about the evidence of a planned robbery. The contrary is much more consistent with her actual words. She wrote that the only “rational inference” that could be drawn was that Mr.&nbsp;Sinclair was at the crime scene, which implies that it would be irrational to conclude that he was not there.</span></p>

In light of both the language and the structure of her reasons for judgment, I am persuaded that the trial judge found the circumstantial evidence to be seriously incriminating for Mr. Sinclair. In my view, her reasoning process was not disturbed by the question of the planned robbery to the extent my colleague Fish J. suggests. Therefore, even assuming that she did misapprehend the evidence concerning the existence of a plan to commit a robbery, the error would not have been material within the meaning of the <i>Lohrer</i> test. The contention that an explicit acknowledgement of the absence of evidence in this regard could have raised a reasonable doubt in the trial judge’s mind about Mr. Sinclair’s presence at the crime scene is inconsistent with the reasoning that led her to convict him.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Following his trial by a judge sitting without a jury, the respondent, Terrence Sinclair, was convicted of manslaughter (2007 MBQB 219, 219 Man. R. (2d) 63).&nbsp; The conviction was based on the trial judge’s finding that Mr. Sinclair had participated, together with his co-accused and a youth, in the assault that resulted in the victim’s death.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">On appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Mr. Sinclair challenged his conviction as unreasonable.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge mischaracterized or misapprehended the evidence by inferring both that Mr. Sinclair had planned to go out with his co-accused and the youth to commit a robbery, and that they were out together at the time the fateful assault was committed.&nbsp; In its view, these inferences were based, at least in part, on “evidence” of those facts when there was no such evidence.&nbsp; The court further held that these were not peripheral matters. In its view, “the substratum of findings on which to a material extent the verdict rests is not present” (2009 MBCA 71, 240 Man. R. (2d) 135, at para. 98).&nbsp; Thus, purportedly on the authority of this Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Beaudry</i>, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, the court concluded that the verdict was unreasonable and, as there was evidence capable of supporting a conviction, ordered a new trial.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown appeals with leave of this Court and raises two issues.&nbsp; First, the Crown asks this Court to clarify the test for unreasonable verdicts under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec686subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;686(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>)(i) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, <span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><span style="color:black"><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">R.S.C. 1985, c.

In particular, I agree that <i>Beaudry</i> does not change any of the existing tests for appellate review under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>).&nbsp; As Fish J. states:</span></p>

Nor does <i>Beaudry </i>govern trial court decisions that are rendered inscrutable by an absence of sufficient reasons, as in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.&nbsp; [para. 3]</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Further, nothing in <i>Beaudry</i> should be taken as a departure from the test established in <i>R. v. Lohrer</i>, 2004 SCC 80, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732.&nbsp; Thus, in this appeal, I agree with Fish J. that “the Court of Appeal, to the extent that it appears in some measure to have done so, should not have rested its judgment in this case on <i>Beaudry</i>” (para. 5).&nbsp; As he explains, “[w]hile a misapprehension of the evidence may help to establish that a verdict is unreasonable within the meaning of <i>Yebes </i>and <i>Biniaris</i>, <i>Beaudry</i> does not govern an error of this sort” (para. 14). <i>&nbsp;</i>If the trial judge had indeed misapprehended the evidence as contended by the Court of Appeal, Fish J. rightly states that this kind of error would fall squarely within <i>Lohrer</i>.<i>&nbsp; </i>However, I agree with LeBel J. that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the trial judge made an error that met the standard set out in <i>Lohrer</i>.&nbsp; I would therefore allow the appeal and reinstate Mr.&nbsp;Sinclair’s conviction for the reasons of LeBel J.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">While none of the existing tests have been changed, the approach adopted by the majority in <i>Beaudry</i>,<i> </i>and reiterated in this appeal, did effect an expansion of the test for unreasonableness under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i).&nbsp; Under the traditional <i>Yebes/Biniaris </i>test, <span style="color:black">the reasonableness of the verdict is to be measured against the totality of the evidence<i> </i>adduced at trial (<i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168; <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381).&nbsp; This test continues to apply.&nbsp; However, where the verdict under review is that of a trial judge without a jury, the reasonableness of the verdict may also be assessed, as Fish J. puts it, “</span>by scrutinizing the logic of the judge’s <i>findings of fact or inferences drawn from the evidence admitted at trial</i>” (para. 15 (emphasis in original)).&nbsp; Explaining how this added dimension of the reasonableness test should be applied on appellate review is somewhat more difficult.&nbsp; This is where I depart from Fish J.’s analysis.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">As I read his reasons, Fish J. explains how this expanded approach may play out by describing the kind of errors in the appreciation of the evidence or in the fact-finding process that may result in a verdict which would properly be treated as unreasonable.&nbsp; See in particular paras. 16 and 19-21.&nbsp; There may well be a logical connection between certain mistakes with respect to the substance of the evidence and the reasonableness of the verdict.&nbsp; However, with great respect, I find my colleague’s “reasoning-based approach”, if I may describe it that way, unhelpful.&nbsp; Reviewing courts would have to make rather fine distinctions between different types of mistakes in order to identify the applicable test.&nbsp; This distinction is especially hard to make because the fact-finding process is difficult to articulate with precision.&nbsp; For example, at what point is the trial judge making a finding of fact “that is . . . plainly contradicted by the evidence relied on for that purpose by the judge” (reasons of Fish J., at para. 16), rather than a “mistak[e] as to the substance of material parts of the evidence” (<i>Lohrer</i>, at para. 1, citing <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 221)?&nbsp; What, really, is the difference between a “mistak[e] as to the substance of . . . the evidence” (<i>Lohrer</i>)<i> </i>and a finding that is “demonstrably incompatible with evidence that is not otherwise contradicted or rejected by the trial judge” (reasons of Fish J., at para. 16)?</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">This appeal exemplifies the difficulty.&nbsp; As Fish J. himself concludes, the impact on the verdict of errors in the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence and reasoning process of the kind identified by the Court of Appeal was to be assessed, not by asking whether the verdict was unreasonable, but by asking whether it resulted in a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In my respectful view, the scope of the test for unreasonableness under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i), as expanded in <i>Beaudry</i>,<i> </i>is better understood if the focus remains on the <i>conclusion</i> reached at trial, rather than on the trial judge’s appreciation of the evidence or the reasoning process that led to the verdict.&nbsp; As I will explain, a verdict-focussed approach is more consistent with the wording of the provision, the legislative context and history, and the established jurisprudence.&nbsp; It also avoids any unnecessary blurring of the line between unreasonable verdicts under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) and misapprehensions of evidence resulting in a miscarriage of justice under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii).</span></p>

A conviction which is the product of a miscarriage of justice cannot stand.&nbsp; <u>Section 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) is concerned with the most obvious example of a miscarriage of justice, a conviction which no reasonable trier of fact properly instructed could have returned on the evidence adduced at trial.</u>&nbsp; Section 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) read along with s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) presumes that an error in law produces a miscarriage of justice unless the Crown can demonstrate the contrary with the requisite degree of certainty.&nbsp; Section 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) addresses all other miscarriages of justice not caught by the two preceding subsections.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

Pittiman</i>, 2006 SCC 9, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 14, cited in<i> Beaudry</i>, at<i> </i>para. 57).&nbsp; The majority in <i>Beaudry </i>held further that a verdict may be unreasonable because of fundamental flaws in the reasoning process that led to it.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[78]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">However, in my view, the disjunctive “or” should not be read as indicative of Parliament’s intention to change the <i>focus </i>of the reasonableness analysis in judge-alone trials from the conclusion reached at trial to the reasoning process that led to it.&nbsp; As the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario rightly argues, such an interpretation does not accord with the legislative history of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec686subsec1" target="_blank">s. 686(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The legislative history is succinctly summarized in its factum as follows (at para. 7):</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Canada, the power to overturn a conviction on the ground it is “unreasonable” or “cannot be supported by the evidence” has existed since 1923, and is modeled on s. 4 of England’s <i>Criminal Appeal Act</i>. Originally, the power was expressly limited in its application to jury verdicts.&nbsp; The 1955 [<i>sic</i>] amendments to the <i>Code</i> altered the phrase “verdict of the jury” to “the verdict”, thereby availing this ground to verdicts rendered in judge alone trials.&nbsp; Nothing suggests however that this amendment was intended to alter the purpose of this provision beyond ensuring the reasonableness of the conclusion reached.&nbsp; The “unreasonable verdict” provision has remained unchanged since 1955.&nbsp; [Emphasis deleted.]</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">Given this legislative history, it is clear that the phrases “unreasonable” and “cannot be supported by the evidence” both apply to a bare jury verdict as much as they do to a trial judge’s verdict.&nbsp; As such, Parliament’s use of the word “or” in s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) does not mandate a focus on the reasoning process that led to the verdict on appeals from a trial judge’s verdict.&nbsp; Indeed, when that provision is considered in its statutory context, and according to its grammatical and ordinary sense, it indicates that the appellate court’s focus should be on the <i>verdict</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">Until this Court’s decision </span><span lang="EN-CA">in <i>Beaudry</i>, <span style="color:black">the test for the application of the unreasonable verdict ground under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) was settled.&nbsp; It involved an assessment of the reasonableness of the verdict when measured against the totality of the evidence<i> </i>adduced at trial.&nbsp; In <i>Yebes</i>, a case involving a jury, the Court stated the test as follows (at p. 186):</span></span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The function of the Court of Appeal, under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec613subsec1" target="_blank">s. 613(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>)(i) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, goes beyond merely finding that there is evidence to support a conviction.&nbsp; <u>The Court [of Appeal] must determine on the whole of the evidence whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.</u>&nbsp; While the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the Court [of Appeal] must re-examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence.&nbsp; This process will be the same whether the case is based on circumstantial or direct evidence.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">The <i>Yebes</i> test is expressed in terms of a verdict reached by a jury.&nbsp; The question that occupied this Court in <i>Beaudry </i>and in this appeal is whether the test for an unreasonable verdict is the same when the verdict is reached by a judge sitting without a jury.&nbsp; The Court was divided on this issue in <i>Beaudry</i>.&nbsp; As I have indicated at the outset, this division led to some uncertainty about the governing test. &nbsp;In this appeal, the Court confirms that the <i>Yebes/Biniaris </i>test continues to govern, but that <i>Beaudry </i>has effectively added a new dimension to the test for unreasonableness in judge-alone trials, albeit one of limited scope. &nbsp;In exceptional cases, flaws in the trial judge’s reasoning process may result in an unreasonable verdict even though the verdict is otherwise available on the evidence.&nbsp; As Fish J. notes, unreasonable verdicts of the sort targeted by the <i>Beaudry </i>test “are exceedingly rare” (para. 22).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">In my view, it is important to stress that, while the reviewing court may now look beyond the evidence adduced at trial and consider flaws in the reasoning process in the assessment for reasonableness, the focus must remain on the <i>conclusion </i>reached at trial.&nbsp; For s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) to be properly invoked, it is the <i>verdict</i> that must be in error.&nbsp; As such, it would be wrong to conclude that whenever there is an error in reasoning, even if of the kind “demonstrably incompatible” with the uncontradicted evidence at trial, the verdict is unreasonable.&nbsp; As stated by LeBel J. in <i>R. v. Jaw</i>, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, “[a]n error in proceedings that does not lead to an unreasonable verdict, a wrong decision on a question of law or a miscarriage of justice is indeed an error, but one without legal effect” (para. 29).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">Under each ground of appeal set out in s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>), any error must be assessed in context.&nbsp; For example, before an appellate court concludes that a misapprehension of evidence has resulted in a miscarriage of justice under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii), it must consider whether the misapprehension played “an essential part not just in the narrative of the judgment but ‘in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction’” (<i>Lohrer</i>, at para. 2).&nbsp; Likewise, not every error of law will require a new hearing under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii). Section 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) provides that the conviction may be affirmed where “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred”.&nbsp; Similarly, any error in reasoning identified under the <i>Beaudry </i>test must be carefully assessed to determine whether it vitiates the <i>verdict</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:black">It is useful in the assessment of reasonableness to recall that the curative proviso does not apply to an unreasonable verdict under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i).&nbsp; Thus, if the reviewing court focusses on the type of error committed in the reasoning process, rather than on the verdict itself, it may wrongfully leap to the conclusion that a simple error in logic in the trial judge’s reasons necessitates a new trial.&nbsp; For example, as the Crown states in its factum, “[i]t would be incongruous if a conviction could be affirmed under [the curative proviso] . . . in a case where the trial judge had incorrectly admitted a piece of evidence (e.g., on the basis that the other evidence in the case was overwhelming) but not in a case where the trial judge had correctly excluded the evidence but then mistakenly referred to it in convicting the accused” (para. 53).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) inquiry in judge-alone trials should proceed as follows:</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:
-58.5pt"><span lang="EN-CA">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reviewing court should first apply the <span style="color:black">test in <i>Yebes/Biniaris</i>.<i> </i>&nbsp;The question is whether </span>the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered on the evidence as a whole.&nbsp; If not, then the test is met, the inquiry is over, and an acquittal is entered.</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:

As stated earlier, an unreasonable verdict of the kind identified in <i>Beaudry </i>will be exceedingly rare.&nbsp; It is therefore not necessary to conduct this assessment in every case.&nbsp; Unless the issue is specifically raised, or the circumstances clearly call for this further inquiry, the impact of </span>errors in the reasoning process that led to the verdict falls to be assessed under either s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) (errors of law) or s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) (miscarriage of justice).</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:
-58.5pt"><span lang="EN-CA">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Beaudry </i>test may apply in <span style="color:black">exceptional cases where the reasoning process of the trial judge is so irrational, or so at odds with the evidence, that it vitiates the verdict — even though that verdict is available on the evidence as a whole.&nbsp; In these rare cases, an appellate court will be justified in concluding that the verdict itself is unreasonable.&nbsp; What precise kinds of errors would justify this conclusion is a question better left to be decided in cases where the issue will arise.&nbsp; If the reviewing court so concludes, a new trial is ordered, as the court will have already determined under the <i>Yebes/Biniaris </i>test that the verdict is otherwise available on the evidence.</span></span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In the present case, the Court of Appeal rightly concluded that the evidence adduced at trial was capable of supporting a conviction.&nbsp; Thus, Mr. Sinclair cannot meet the <i>Yebes/Biniaris</i> test.&nbsp; Nor can he properly invoke the <i>Beaudry </i>test as there is no fundamental flaw in the reasoning process that led to the trial judge’s verdict.&nbsp; Finally, for the reasons of LeBel J., I conclude that the trial judge did not misapprehend the evidence in finding that Mr. Sinclair had participated in the assault that resulted in the victim’s death.</span></p>
