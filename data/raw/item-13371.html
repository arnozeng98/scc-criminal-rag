margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in law in finding that the elements of the offence had not been made out.&nbsp; With respect to the <i>actus&nbsp;reus</i> of the offence, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the words uttered by the accused did not amount to threats because they were not conveyed to their intended recipients and they did not cause anyone to be fearful or intimidated.&nbsp; It is not necessary to prove that the threats were conveyed to their intended recipients or to prove that anyone was actually intimidated or made fearful as a result of the words uttered in order to make out the prohibited act of the offence.&nbsp; As for the <i>mens rea</i> of the offence, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in finding that in order to make out the fault element it was necessary to prove that the accused intended the words to be transmitted to their objects/recipients and specifically intended to intimidate the ultimate objects of the threats. &nbsp;In other words, each failed to consider the disjunctive nature of the fault element required for the offence. &nbsp;It would have been sufficient had the accused intended that the threats be taken seriously by those to whom the words were spoken.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown has met its burden to demonstrate that the trial judge‚Äôs legal error with regard to the fault element might reasonably be thought, in the circumstances of this case to have had a material bearing on the acquittal. &nbsp;Indeed, had the trial judge not erred as to that element of the offence, he would have had to consider whether the accused intended his threatening words to be taken seriously and the evidence of two witnesses provided some basis to conclude that he did.&nbsp; Accordingly, the acquittals should be set aside.&nbsp; However, this is not the clearest of cases where this Court‚Äôs power to enter a conviction should be exercised. &nbsp;A new trial is therefore required to determine whether the charges against the accused will be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

In particular, it raises two issues:</p>

line-height:200%">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order for the offence to be made out, is it necessary to prove that the threats were conveyed to their subjects and/or that the accused intended that they be so conveyed?</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left:.25in;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude that the offence does not require proof that the accused‚Äôs threats were conveyed to their subject or that someone was actually intimidated by them. Further, the Crown need not establish that the accused intended that the threats be conveyed to their subject or to intimidate anyone. In our view, and with respect to the contrary opinion of the Court of Appeal, the trial judge made legal errors in his analysis of the offence and the Crown has met its burden of showing that these errors might reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on his decision to acquit. We would, therefore, allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>

For a time, Louis-Joseph Comeau, √âdouard Collin, and Patrick Cloutier were also detained at the same detention centre.&nbsp; The respondent introduced Mr. Comeau to Mr. Cloutier as his [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] ‚Äúcontract killer‚Äù.&nbsp; At times, Mr. Cloutier passed on messages from Mr. Comeau to the respondent.</p>

Mr. Comeau was convicted of uttering threats in a separate trial (<i>R. v. Comeau</i>, 2010 QCCQ 20939 (CanLII)). At issue on this appeal are five counts of knowingly conveying to Patrick Cloutier and √âdouard Collin, at various times between June 1, 2009, and September 5, 2009, threats to cause death or bodily harm, contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec264.1subsec1" target="_blank">s. 264.1(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The trial judge found that Messrs. Cloutier and Collin were credible witnesses (para. 12), but held that the fault element (the <i>mens rea</i>) of the offences had not been established because the words were not conveyed by the respondent with the intent that they would be transmitted to the subjects of the threats in an attempt to influence their actions (paras. 14-15). He found that the respondent rather intended to seek revenge once the trial was done, and that he had uttered the words out of anger and frustration (paras. 14 and 16).</p>

The court confirmed the trial judge‚Äôs finding that the respondent acted out of frustration and with an intention to seek revenge rather than an intention to intimidate (para. 16).</p>

The elements of the offence include: (1) the utterance or conveyance of a threat to cause death or bodily harm; and (2) an intent to threaten. We review here the law relating to each element.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:-63.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Prohibited Act (<i>Actus Reus</i>) </u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prohibited act of the offence is ‚Äúthe uttering of threats of death or serious bodily harm‚Äù (<i>Clemente</i>, at p. 763). The threats can be uttered, conveyed, or in any way caused to be received by any person. The question of whether words constitute a threat is a question of law to be decided on an objective standard. Justice Cory put it this way in <i>McCraw</i>:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">The structure and wording of s. 264.1(1)(<i>a</i>) indicate that the nature of the threat must be looked at objectively; that is, as it would be by the ordinary reasonable person. . . .</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question to be resolved may be put in the following way. Looked at objectively, in the context of all the words written or spoken and having regard to the person to whom they were directed, would the questioned words convey a threat of serious bodily harm to a reasonable person? [pp. 82-83]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point of the analysis should always be the plain and ordinary meaning of the words uttered. Where the words clearly constitute a threat and there is no reason to believe that they had a secondary or less obvious meaning, the analysis is complete. However, in some cases, the context reveals that words that would on their face appear threatening may not constitute threats within the meaning of s. 264.1(1)(<i>a</i>) (see, e.g., <i>O‚ÄôBrien</i>, at paras. 10-12). In other cases, contextual factors might have the effect of elevating to the level of threats words that would, on their face, appear relatively innocent (see, e.g<i>.</i>,<i> R. v. MacDonald </i>(2002), 166 O.A.C. 121, where the words uttered were ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre next‚Äù).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, in <i>R. v. Felteau</i>, 2010 ONCA 821 (CanLII), the accused had told a mental health care worker that he was going to follow Ms. G, his former probation officer, and ‚Äúassault‚Äù her (paras. 1-2).&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge found that the words did not constitute a threat because the threat must be of death or bodily harm and the accused‚Äôs reference to ‚Äúassault‚Äù did not necessarily include bodily harm (para. 3). The Court of Appeal for Ontario found that the trial judge had erred in looking at the word ‚Äúassault‚Äù in isolation from the circumstances (para. 7). The court held that the factors relevant to the determination of the meaning of the words included the facts that: the accused was fixated upon Ms. G and had very recently been convicted of harassing her; he was angry with Ms. G when he uttered the words; he blamed her for his arrest and detention; and he was mentally unstable, had been consuming cocaine and had a known history of serious violence directed at women (para. 8). The Court of Appeal concluded that the accused‚Äôs words, viewed in these circumstances, would convey a threat of bodily harm to a reasonable person (para. 9).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the legal question of whether the accused uttered a threat of death or bodily harm turns solely on the meaning that a reasonable person would attach to the words viewed in the circumstances in which they were uttered or conveyed. The <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Crown<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> need not prove that the intended recipient of the threat was made aware of it, or if aware of it, that he or she was intimidated by it or took it seriously (<i>Clemente</i>, at p. 763; <i>O‚ÄôBrien</i>, at para. 13;<i> R. v. LeBlanc</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1583 (confirming the trial judge‚Äôs instruction that it was not necessary that ‚Äúthe person threatened be ever aware that the threat was made‚Äù: (1988), 90 N.B.R. (2d) 63 (C.A.), at para. 13)).&nbsp; Further, the words do not have to be directed towards a specific person; a threat against an ascertained group of people is sufficient (<i>R. v. R√©my</i> (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 176 (Que. C.A.), at p. 185, leave to appeal refused, [1993] 4 S.C.R. vii (threat against ‚Äúpolice officers‚Äù generally); <i>R. v. Upson</i>, 2001 NSCA 89, 194 N.S.R. (2d) 87, at para. 31 (threat against ‚Äúmembers of the black race‚Äù generally)).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasonable person standard must be applied in light of the particular circumstances of a case. As the Court of Appeal for Ontario explained in <i>R. v. Batista</i>, 2008 ONCA 804, 62 C.R. (6th) 376:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ordinary reasonable person considering an alleged threat objectively would be one informed of all the circumstances relevant to his or her determination.&nbsp; The characteristics of a reasonable person were considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. S. (R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 (S.C.C.), in the context of the test for bias.&nbsp; In that case, L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√© and McLachlin JJ., at para. 36, described such a person as a:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left:1.0in">reasonable, informed, practical and realistic person who considers the matter in some detail. . . .&nbsp; The person postulated is not a ‚Äúvery sensitive or scrupulous‚Äù person, but rather a right-minded person familiar with the circumstances of the case.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">Similarly, in <i>R. v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265 (S.C.C.), at p. 282, in the context of the test for bringing the administration of justice into disrepute, Lamer J. for the majority describes a reasonable person as ‚Äúdispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances of the case‚Äù: see also <i>R. v. Burlingham</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206 (S.C.C.), at para. 71.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>It follows that a reasonable person considering whether the impugned words amount to a threat at law is one who is objective, fully-informed, right-minded, dispassionate, practical and realistic.</u> [Emphasis added; paras. 23-24.]</p>

Drawing these inferences is not a departure from the subjective standard of fault. In <i>R. v.

 <p class="Citation-AltC"><u>In trying to ascertain what was going on in the accused‚Äôs mind, as the subjective approach demands, the trier of fact may draw reasonable inferences from the accused‚Äôs actions or words at the time of his act or in the witness box.</u> &nbsp;The accused may or may not be believed.&nbsp; To conclude that, considering all the evidence, the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Crown<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused ‚Äúmust‚Äù have thought in the penalized way is no departure from the subjective substantive standard.&nbsp; Resort to an objective substantive standard would only occur if the reasoning became that the accused ‚Äúmust have realized it if he had thought about it‚Äù.

The person targeted by the threat ‚Äï the accused‚Äôs ex-girlfriend ‚Äï had testified that she had not been frightened by the accused‚Äôs words. The trial judge strongly relied on this evidence to conclude that, despite the fact that the words on their own appeared threatening, she was left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the necessary intent to threaten (2012 MBCA 6, 275 Man.

After she was made aware of the accused‚Äôs reference to a house burning, the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Crown<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> attorney took the comment seriously and was very frightened by it.

The trial judge concluded that the words might ‚Äúhave been blurted out on the spur of the moment, or driven by bravado, but given all the circumstances . . . the evidence demonstrate[d] that the accused was aware that it would be taken seriously‚Äù (para. 35).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal for Manitoba confirmed the factual findings of the trial judge, specifically the contextual analysis she undertook with regard to the fault element (<i>Noble</i>, at para. 17).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To sum up, the fault element of the offence is made out if the accused intended the words uttered or conveyed to intimidate <i>or </i>to be taken seriously. It is not necessary to prove an intent that the words be conveyed to the subject of the threat. A subjective standard of fault applies. However, in order to determine what was in the accused‚Äôs mind, a court will often have to draw reasonable inferences from the words and the circumstances, including how the words were perceived by those hearing them.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>First Issue:</i> <i>Is the Confidential Nature of a Threat Relevant to the Analysis?</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in law in finding that the elements of the offence had not been made out because the threats were conveyed in a so-called ‚Äúclosed circle‚Äù. Even if it is true that the respondent could have expected his words to remain confidential, a conclusion we would not necessarily be ready to confirm, this does not preclude a finding that both the prohibited act and the fault element of the offence had been made out. This is so because, as explained above, it is not necessary to prove that the threats were conveyed to their intended recipients (prohibited act) or that the accused intended the threats to be so conveyed (fault element). Further, it is not necessary to prove that anyone was actually intimidated by the threats (prohibited act) or that the accused specifically intended to intimidate anyone (fault element). The concept of the ‚Äúclosed circle‚Äù is therefore legally wrong.&nbsp; Threats are tools of intimidation and violence.&nbsp; As such, in any circumstance where threats are spoken with the intent that they be taken seriously, even to third parties, the elements of the offence will be made out.&nbsp; As we explain below, the trial judge erred in both respects with regard to the fault element, and the Court of Appeal erred in both respects with regard to the prohibited act and the fault element.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:-63.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Prohibited Act</u><i> </i></p>

For its part, the Court of Appeal found that the ‚Äúwords used by the respondent, considered objectively, may raise serious concerns that acts likely to cause death or bodily harm will occur at the respondent‚Äôs behest‚Äù and that this was ‚Äúin fact what the respondent‚Äôs fellow inmates understood him to mean‚Äù (para. 8). However, the court found that ‚Äúwhen these words and comments are put in context‚Äù, they did not constitute a threat (para. 8). The court described that context as follows:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comments transmitted or conveyed by the respondent to three fellow inmates cannot be likened to a ‚Äútool of intimidation which is designed to instill a sense of fear in its recipient‚Äù; rather, it is on par with a threatening letter that is never sent in the mail. These conversations took place in a closed circle. The mere expression of a thought is not enough to attribute a criminal act. As the trial judge rightly pointed out, there is no ‚Äúrecipient‚Äù here. The comments made are [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] ‚Äúan expression of a criminal‚Äôs frustration and outrage at feeling caught by the judicial system‚Äù. The element of fear instilled in a victim is therefore absent. [para. 9]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the Court of Appeal concluded that the words did not amount to threats because they were not conveyed to their intended recipients and they did not cause anyone to be fearful or intimidated. As we see it, in light of the legal principles reviewed above, the court erred in this conclusion: in our view, it is not necessary to prove that the threats were conveyed to their intended recipients or to prove that anyone was actually intimidated or made fearful as a result of the words uttered in order to make out the prohibited act of the offence.</p>

He held that the fault element had not been made out because [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] ‚Äúthe evidence d[id] not establish that the words used by the accused when addressing Collin and Cloutier were intended to reach the ears of the possible or potential witnesses‚Äù<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[1]</span></a></span> &nbsp;(para. 14). He found that it would have been different if the respondent intended to convey a message to the potential informers in order to dissuade them from testifying (para. 14). Similarly, he found that the respondent could not have imagined that if Mr. Cloutier and Mr. Collin conveyed the words to the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Crown<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> prosecutor or the officer-investigator that their attitude might change (para. 15). Thus, in the trial judge‚Äôs opinion, the respondent did not have the necessary intent to utter threats towards any of the complainants.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal for Quebec confirmed the trial judge‚Äôs findings that the words ‚Äúwere [not] intended to reach the ears of the possible or potential witnesses‚Äù and that Mr. Cloutier and Mr. Collin were not ‚Äúsupposed to, either implicitly or explicitly, convey this message to the persons concerned‚Äù (para. 16). In short, the fault element was not made out because there was no intent to intimidate (para. 16). The court concluded, with regard to the fault element:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent did not present any evidence and he did not testify. It is difficult to know what he was thinking. Did he believe that his comments would be reported and could scare the persons contemplated in his plans? The judge rejected this theory, deeming it to be neither likely nor logical. It may be that the judge speculated on this matter, but the fact remains that the burden of proving wrongful intent ‚Äï <u>that is, the respondent‚Äôs intent to attempt to intimidate</u> ‚Äï rested with the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Crown<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, who failed to discharge it.

Katigbak</i>, 2011 SCC 48, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 326, at para. 50). This is a power that should be used only in the clearest of cases (<i>R. v. Audet</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 171, at para 48).</p>
