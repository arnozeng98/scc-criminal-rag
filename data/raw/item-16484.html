The police told P they would treat this as a “no case” seizure, meaning that they intended to seize the roaches without charging him. Once inside, the police observed a bulletproof vest, a firearm and drugs. They arrested P and obtained a telewarrant to search his apartment, which led to the discovery of other firearms and drugs and to charges against P. P was convicted at trial and the Court of Appeal of British Columbia upheld the convictions. The Court of Appeal rejected P’s argument that the common law confessions rule should have precluded the admission of his statement about the roaches at the <i>voir dire</i>, as the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his statement was voluntarily made.</p>

The Crown must prove the voluntariness of an accused’s statement before it can rely upon that statement at trial as supporting a finding of guilt. T</span>he purpose of the judicial inquiry in a <i>Charter voir dire </i>is distinct from the purpose of a criminal trial. A criminal trial is concerned with determining whether the accused is guilty of an offence. In a <i>Charter voir dire</i>, however, the focus is not on the accused’s guilt, but on whether the accused’s constitutional rights were infringed. A <i>Charter voir dire</i> therefore<i> </i>involves a review of the totality of the circumstances known to, and relied upon, by the state actor at the time of the impugned action. O<span style="line-height:200%">nly the state actor’s contemporary state of mind and conduct is at issue, and not the truthfulness of the statement upon which he or she relied. </span>It is for this reason that the truthfulness of a statement has no bearing upon its admissibility; rather, the inquiry is focussed upon whether it was reasonable for the state actor to rely upon the statement as forming grounds for the action under scrutiny. <span style="line-height:200%">Admitting a statement by an accused for the purpose of assessing the constitutionality of state action, as opposed to the purpose of determining the accused’s guilt, does not engage the rationale for the confessions rule. To apply the confessions rule to evidence presented at a <i>Charter voir dire</i> would distort both the rule and its rationale. It would stifle police investigations, compromise public safety and needlessly lengthen and complicate <i>voir dire</i> proceedings. </span></p>

Those circumstances must render it “impracticable” to obtain a warrant. I</span>n order for a warrantless entry to satisfy s.&nbsp;11(7), the Crown must show that the entry was compelled by urgency, calling for immediate police action to preserve evidence, officer safety or public safety.

Nor, just as importantly, did the circumstances presented by P’s admission to having some partially consumed roaches, coupled with the police officers’ wish to seize them on a no case basis, make it impracticable to obtain a warrant. Section&nbsp;11(7) is not satisfied by mere inconvenience, but impracticability. Here, the police had a practicable option: to arrest P and obtain a warrant to enter the residence and seize the roaches. If the situation was not serious enough to arrest and apply for a warrant, then it cannot have been serious enough to intrude into a private residence without a warrant. Further, concern for officer safety did not drive the decision to proceed with warrantless entry; rather, warrantless entry gave rise to concern for officer safety. </span></p>

These police officers were not operating in unknown legal territory: their intention to effect a seizure on a “no case” basis was legally insignificant, in light of the well-established legal principles governing the authority of police to enter a residence without a warrant. </span>The balancing of the relevant factors — seriousness of state conduct, seriousness of the infringement of <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights and the impact upon society’s interest in adjudication — will never be an entirely objective exercise. While the effective destruction of the Crown’s case weighs heavily, so does the warrantless entry into a private residence, having occurred to prevent P from destroying three roaches which the police themselves intended to destroy. It is important not to allow the third factor of society’s interest in adjudicating a case on its merits to trump all other considerations, particularly where, as here, the impugned conduct was serious and worked a substantial impact on P’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> right.

It is not to judge the police conduct against a standard that exceeds the wisdom and training of experienced trial and appellate judges. In an effort to clarify the law, it is accepted that s.&nbsp;11(7) of the <i><span style="line-height:200%">Controlled Drug and Substances Act </span></i><span style="line-height:200%">was not available to the police on the facts of this case. Rather, in the circumstances, the police had three options available to them. They could have (1)&nbsp;tried to obtain P’s lawful consent to enter his apartment and seize the roaches; (2)&nbsp;arrested P and obtained a warrant to search his apartment and seize the roaches; or (3)&nbsp;thrown up their hands and walked away, in dereliction of their duty to seize illicit drugs, even if only to catalogue and destroy them. That said, it is hardly fair to castigate the police for their conduct when prior to this case, the legal boundaries of s.&nbsp;11(7) in the context of a “no case” seizure were at best unclear. One need only look to the lower court decisions to realize this.</span></p>

The impact of the police entry on P’s privacy interest is also attenuated because the evidence was lawfully discoverable if the police had obtained a warrant.</p>

The cumulative effect of legal uncertainty, police good faith, and the discoverability and reliability of critical evidence needed for there to be a trial on the merits resolves the balance in favour of admitting the evidence. In these circumstances, it is the exclusion of reliable and crucial evidence implicating P in very serious gun and drug offences that is far more likely to cause the public to lose faith and confidence in our criminal justice system. That said, in a case like this one, it is possible that an alternative remedy short of the exclusion of evidence, such as a sentence reduction, might be available under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

In addition, and depending on its determination of the second and third issues, the Court may have to consider whether the evidence obtained as the result of a warrantless entry and search of the appellant’s residence should be excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

Once inside, the police observed a bulletproof vest, a firearm and drugs. They arrested the appellant and obtained a telewarrant, which led to the discovery of other firearms and drugs and to charges against the appellant in a nine-count indictment. At trial, the appellant alleged that the warrantless entry into his residence breached his <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> right to be secure from an unreasonable search<span style="line-height:200%"> or seizure, as there were no “exigent circumstances” rendering it impracticable to obtain a warrant, within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en#!fragment/sec11subsec7" target="_blank">s. 11(7)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en" target="_blank">CDSA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i></span>. Additionally, he alleged a further s. 8 breach arising from the police filing a late and incomplete report to the clerk of the court for the telewarrant.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par3" class="">3</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that exigent circumstances justified the entry into the residence. He also, however, found that the late and incomplete report infringed the appellant’s s. 8 right, but he admitted the evidence and convicted the appellant. His decision was affirmed at the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, before which the appellant advanced a new argument. The common law confessions rule should, he said, have precluded the admission of his statement about the roaches at the <i>voir dire</i> considering the lawfulness of the entry and search, as the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his statement was voluntarily made. The Court of Appeal rejected that argument, and upheld the convictions.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par4" class="">4</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the confessions rule has no application here. I reach a different conclusion, however, on the matter of the police entry into the appellant’s residence which, in my respectful view, was not justified by exigent circumstances making it impracticable to obtain a warrant. As I am also of the view that the evidence obtained therefrom should be excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, it is unnecessary to decide whether a late and incomplete report could itself be a ground for a finding of an infringement of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, and whether there was in fact such a breach. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the appellant’s convictions and enter acquittals.</p>

After speaking to the caller’s mother who directed them to the appellant (C.W.’s boyfriend), the officers attended at the appellant’s apartment building. The building manager gave them the appellant’s apartment number, and told them that C.W. had been taken to hospital with unknown injuries. <span style="line-height:200%">(C.W. would later tell police that she had accidentally slipped and hit the back of her head, and that the appellant did not cause her injury.) </span>After police repeatedly knocked on the appellant’s apartment door and announced their presence, the appellant opened the door. As he did so, Constable Dykeman noticed the odour of raw and smoked marihuana.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par6" class="">6</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After questioning the appellant about the 911 call and satisfying themselves that no one was in need of assistance, the officers asked him about the odour. He first denied its source, then acknowledged possessing some unconsumed portions of marihuana “roaches” in his residence. While the number of roaches was not confirmed, Constable Dykeman understood there to be three. The officers explained that they would have to seize the roaches, but that they would treat this as a “no case” seizure, meaning that they intended to seize the roaches without charging him. (Constable Dykeman testified to considering obtaining a warrant, but decided not to and instead simply seize the roaches so that he and the other officers could be on their way.) The appellant agreed to hand over the roaches and attempted to close the door, but Constable Dykeman blocked the door with his foot and said he would not let the appellant out of his sight. He testified having done so out of concern that the appellant would destroy the roaches, and for “officer safety”. Constable Dykeman followed the appellant into his residence. Constable Bell followed out of a concern that it was unsafe for Constable Dykeman to be alone with the appellant. <span style="line-height:200%">(C.W.’s mother had advised the police that the appellant had a shotgun.)</span></p>

As he did so, Constable Dykeman observed a bulletproof vest on a couch, a handgun on an end table, and a bag of pills (which he believed to be ecstasy) on a speaker stand. He and Constable Bell immediately arrested and searched the appellant, finding a cell phone and a large amount of cash. A sweep of the residence revealed two large bags of pills (also believed to be ecstasy) and a bag of <span style="line-height:200%">what appeared to be crack cocaine on a closet shelf. </span></p>

Police executed the warrant that same day, finding quantities of cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy pills, marihuana and oxycodone, drug paraphernalia, four loaded weapons, a bulletproof vest as well as a large amount of cash. Ultimately, Mr. Paterson was convicted of four counts of possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm, three counts of possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, and two counts of simple possession of a controlled substance.</p>

In this case, while the warrant was executed on November 30, 2007, the form 5.2 report was not filed until February 13, 2008.

(2015 BCCA 205, 372 B.C.A.C. 148)</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par11" class="">11</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">On appeal, the appellant argued, for the first time, that the trial judge had erred by failing to determine the voluntariness of his statement about having roaches in his residence before relying on them in a <i>voir dire</i>. Additionally, he argued that the trial judge erred in finding that exigent circumstances justified police entry into his residence, and in finding that the late and incomplete filing of the form 5.2 report did not justify exclusion of the evidence under s. 24(2). </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par12" class="">12</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The appeal was dismissed. On the matter of voluntariness, the Crown was not required to prove the voluntariness of an accused’s statement for it to be admitted at a <i>voir dire</i>. This followed, the Court of Appeal explained, from the primary rationale of the common law confessions rule — ensuring reliability and trial fairness. That rationale does not apply where the evidence may never be heard by the trier of fact and where the inquiry is into state conduct, not the guilt of the accused. Further, police should be entitled to rely upon a statement to justify an investigation, even where that statement is not the product of an operating mind or is otherwise involuntarily made. Finally, imposing an onus upon the Crown in a <i>voir dire</i> would operate in tension with the prevailing burden upon the accused to demonstrate a breach. </span></p>

Finally, the trial judge’s conclusion under s. 24(2) to admit the evidence obtained from the warrantless entry and subsequent search was entitled to deference. In the result, it was unnecessary to decide whether he correctly found that the mishandling of the form 5.2 report constituted a breach of s. 8.</span></p>

That rule prohibits the admission <i>at trial</i> of statements made by suspects to police or to other persons in authority, unless the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that such statements were voluntary (S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, <i>Criminal Procedure in Canada </i>(2011), at p. 272; <i>R. v. Hodgson</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at para. 17). The Crown’s burden — which is identical to its burden in respect of the accused’s guilt itself — highlights that the rule is linked to the law’s concern that involuntary statements are “<span style="line-height:200%">unreliable as affirmations of guilt” (S.&nbsp;N. Lederman, A.&nbsp;W. Bryant and M.&nbsp;K. Fuerst, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (4th ed. 2014), §8.24; <i>Ibrahim v. The King</i>, [1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.), at p. 609; <i>Boudreau v. The King</i>, [1949] S.C.R. 262; <i>Rothman v.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par15" class="">15</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court has also recognized, however, that concern for the untrustworthiness of involuntary confessions does not entirely capture the rationale for excluding evidence caught by the confessions rule. In <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, the rule was said to rest on fundamental notions of trial fairness and (at p. 173) “the idea that a person in the power of the state’s criminal process has the right to freely choose whether or not to make a statement to the police”, coupled with a “concern [for] the repute and integrity of the judicial process”. Those same concerns, the Court added (at p. 175), underlay the privilege against self-incrimination, and supported recognition of a detainee’s right to silence as a principle of fundamental justice under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. “<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Voluntariness<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>” then, as a concept designed to limit the scope of police investigative techniques, has been broadly associated with the principle that the Crown must, to maintain the repute and integrity of the trial process, establish guilt without the assistance of the accused (<i>Hodgson</i>, at para.&nbsp;23, citing the <i>Report of the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence</i> (1982), at p. 175).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par16" class="">16</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">The foregoing explanations for the confessions rule are not neatly encapsulated and, as the Court has observed more than once, “a rationale for the confessions rule extending beyond trustworthiness has not always been easy to locate (<i>R. v. S.&nbsp;(R.J.)</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, at para. 73; <i>Hodgson</i>, at para. 23). It suffices here to observe that the Crown must prove the voluntariness of an accused’s statement before it can rely upon that statement at trial as supporting a finding of guilt, and that this rule applies to ensure trial fairness and to preclude conviction of an accused based upon compelled and as such inherently unreliable evidence. While, therefore, the rule’s application has been confined to trial, the appellant says that its “broad purpose” should operate to require the Crown to prove the voluntariness of such statements for <i>any </i>purpose — “even for the limited purpose of establishing reasonable grounds for a search” in a <i>voir dire</i>. To confine the judicial inquiry into the voluntariness of a statement to <i>trial</i> evidence, he says, allows police to take “unfair .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. advantage” of “mentally ill and disabled” persons, thereby “engender[ing] systemic imbalance against those in need of the highest legal protections”. Further, the appellant views any evidence assisting the Crown in any way as “incriminating”, such that a statement which justifies a search ought to be shown to have been voluntarily made. It follows, he says, that unreliable evidence such as an involuntary confession cannot be relied upon to justify a search.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par17" class="">17</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">As to the procedure to be followed, the appellant says that the voluntariness of a statement — such as the appellant’s statement regarding the roaches — leading to a police search should be determined prior to the <i>voir dire</i> on the lawfulness of the search. Alternatively, he says, a blended <i>voir dire</i> could occur. In this case, since neither the trial judge nor counsel addressed the voluntariness of the appellant’s statement, and since there is a possibility that his statements could have been ruled involuntary, he says a new trial is necessary.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par18" class="">18</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In my view, the confessions rule should not be expanded as proposed by the appellant. More particularly, for the following reasons, the confessions rule should not apply to statements tendered in the context of a <i>voir dire</i> under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par19" class="">19</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant’s submissions fail to account for the purpose of the judicial inquiry in a <i>Charter voir dire</i>, and its distinction from the purpose of a criminal trial. A criminal trial is concerned with determining whether the accused is guilty of an offence. In a <i>Charter voir dire</i>, however, the focus is not on the accused’s guilt, but on whether the accused’s constitutional rights were infringed. A <i>Charter voir dire</i> therefore<i> </i>involves a review of the totality of the circumstances known to, and relied upon by, the state actor at the time of the impugned action. <span style="line-height:200%">To be clear, only the state actor’s contemporary state of mind and conduct is at issue, and not the truthfulness of the statement upon which he or she relied. </span>It is for this reason that the truthfulness of a statement has no bearing upon its admissibility; rather, the inquiry is focussed upon whether it was reasonable for him or her to rely upon the statement as forming grounds for the action under scrutiny.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par20" class="">20</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The significance of this distinction between the purpose of a <i>Charter voir dire</i> and a trial also governs the admissibility of other forms of evidence, such as hearsay, evidence of bad character or of past discreditable conduct, information obtained from confidential informants, information protected by privilege or, as discussed in <i>R. v. MacKenzie</i>, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at paras. 61-62, personal opinion informed by prior training and experience. Each of these forms of evidence raises either reliability or policy concerns and is therefore subject to strict evidentiary rules which restrict or preclude altogether admissibility for substantive use at the trial proper. Such concerns do not, however, arise at a <i>Charter voir dire</i>, because of the limited purpose for which this evidence may be used — going only to the state actor’s state of mind and conduct, and not to the ultimate reliability of the evidence in determining the guilt of the accused. It follows that admitting a statement made by an accused for that limited purpose without first establishing its voluntariness does not offend the rationales underlying the confessions rule. The confessions rule’s driving concern for trial fairness and avoiding conviction upon <span style="line-height:200%">inherently unreliable evidence simply does not arise at the <i>voir dire</i> stage.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par21" class="">21</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">In sum, admitting a statement by an accused for the purpose of assessing the constitutionality of state action, as opposed to the purpose of determining the accused’s guilt, does not engage the rationale for the confessions rule. To apply the rule to evidence presented at a <i>Charter voir dire</i> would distort both the rule and its rationale. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par22" class="">22</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Second, the appellant’s arguments regarding the ability of police officers to coerce information from vulnerable witnesses are already addressed by our criminal procedure. A substantial distinction separates, on one hand, allowing the Crown to adduce statements at a <i>Charter voir dire</i> without proving voluntariness and, on the other hand, condoning police conduct which coerces involuntary statements. The appellant’s submissions construct a false choice by failing to account for other legal protections against abusive state conduct. For example, the appellant’s concern that police might ignore obvious indicia of unreliability such as an operating mind is addressed by the requirement that the Crown demonstrate that police reasonably relied on an accused’s statement and that it provided the requisite grounds to act. Similarly, coercive or otherwise abusive tactics by police designed to extract information involuntarily from an accused would be subject to scrutiny under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">ss. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> or<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec9" target="_blank"> 9<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, with a view to possible exclusion of such evidence under s. 24(2) or a stay of proceedings. In brief, the appellant’s submissions offer no good reason for concern that the rights of the accused are not entirely reconcilable with the state’s reliance on an accused’s statement to demonstrate the constitutionality of its investigative steps.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par23" class="">23</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Finally, applying the confessions rule to statements adduced in a <i>Charter voir dire</i> would lead to undesirable consequences, inhibiting legitimate and necessary police investigative powers. For example, and as the intervener, the Attorney General of Ontario observed, requiring police to prove the voluntariness of an accused’s statement would contradict this Court’s direction in <i>R. v. Orbanski</i>, 2005 SCC 37, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 3, that police may rely, for the limited purpose of forming grounds for an approved screening device demand, upon answers given roadside by drivers in response to questions about alcohol consumption. To be clear, such evidence entails, as the Court said, “<u>compelled</u> direct participation” by the driver (para. 58 (emphasis added)),<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[2]</span></span></a> which would be inadmissible at trial to prove impairment. The limited purpose of justifying further investigation, however, coupled with the absence of concern for trial fairness and reliability, supports its admissibility at a <i>Charter voir dire</i> considering the constitutionality of the investigation itself and, in particular, of the reasonableness of the officer’s grounds for demanding a breath sample.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par24" class="">24</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">Indeed, in some instances, application of the confessions rule to statements adduced at a <i>Charter voir dire</i></span> would lead to absurdities. Police officers would be required to positively ascertain voluntariness in respect of almost every person they encounter in responding to an emergency, when receiving a 911 call or at other early points in an investigation, where it may be unclear who is a suspect and who is a mere witness. In dynamic and emergent circumstances, police officers must be permitted, within constitutional bounds, to respond and investigate with dispatch. Taken to its logical extension, the appellant’s submission would cast doubt on basic and uncontroversial police practices which are dependent upon statements made by suspects. It would stifle police investigations, compromise public safety and needlessly lengthen and complicate <i>voir dire</i> proceedings — all, it bears reiterating, to secure protections which (as I have explained at para. 22) our criminal procedure already affords accused persons.</p>

Parliament, which regularly and expertly legislates pursuant to its criminal law power, could have easily conditioned warrantless searches under s. 11(7) in precisely the same terms as contained in s. 529.3(2). That it chose not to do so is unsurprising, when s. 529.3(2) is considered alongside other provisions in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> authorizing warrantless entry — an important consideration, given that statutory interpretation entails discerning Parliament’s intent by examining the words of a statute in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statute’s schemes and objects (<i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.

In light of those provisions, there is no good reason to believe that Parliament intended the definition of “exigent circumstances” in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec529.3subsec2" target="_blank">s. 529.3(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> to be read into <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en#!fragment/sec11subsec7" target="_blank">s. 11(7)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en" target="_blank">CDSA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

In this regard, I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal’s understanding of s. 11(7) as contemplating that the impracticability of obtaining a warrant would itself comprise exigent circumstances. The text of s. 11(7) (“by reason of exigent circumstances it would be impracticable to obtain [a warrant]”) makes clear that the impracticability of obtaining a warrant does not support a finding of exigent circumstances. It is the other way around: exigent circumstances must be shown to make it impracticable to obtain a warrant. In other words, “impracticability”, howsoever understood, cannot justify a warrantless search under s. 11(7) on the basis that it constitutes an exigent circumstance. Rather, exigent circumstances must be shown to cause impracticability.&nbsp; </span></p>

In other words, he maintains that the “impracticability” of obtaining a warrant should be understood to mean impossibility. Conversely, the Crown submits that a much lower threshold is indicated, such that obtaining a warrant is not “realistic” (whatever that may mean) or “practical”.</span></p>

Viewed in the context of s. 11(7), however — including its requirement of exigent circumstances — “impracticability” suggests on balance a more stringent standard, requiring that it be impossible in practice or unmanageable to obtain a warrant.<span style="line-height:200%"> The French version of “impracticable” in s. 11(7) — “<i>difficilement r</i></span><i><span style="line-height:200%">éalisable</span></i><span style="line-height:200%">” — is also consistent with a condition whose rigour falls short of impossibility but exceeds mere impracticality of obtaining a warrant.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[3]</span></span></a> </span><span style="line-height:200%">So understood, then, “impracticable” within the meaning of s. 11(7) contemplates that the exigent nature of the circumstances are such that taking time to obtain a warrant would seriously undermine the objective of police action — whether it be preserving evidence, officer safety or public safety. </span></p>

First, the police officers had “reasonable grounds to believe that there was a quantity, albeit a small quantity, of a controlled substance in the accused’s apartment” (para. 75). Second, they reasonably believed “that the controlled substance would be lost, destroyed, or consumed <u>given that they did not intend to arrest the accused for possession of this amount of marihuana and accordingly he would have remained in the apartment</u>” (para. 75 (emphasis added)). Those circumstances, he said (at para. 76, quoting <i>R. v. Erickson</i>, 2003 BCCA 693, 192 B.C.A.C. 203, at para. 33) made it impracticable (understood as “something less than impossible and import[ing] a large measure of practicality”) to obtain a warrant, such that the police officers’ actions were justified by s. 11(7). The Court of Appeal, in reaching the same conclusion, noted the appellant’s admission to having marihuana in his residence, that the police had no intention of arresting him but only wanted to seize the roaches and be on their way, and that, had they left the appellant to obtain a warrant, “he could have easily destroyed the roaches” (para. 72).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="line-height:200%">[<a name="par39" class="">39</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="line-height:200%">With respect, the prospect of the appellant destroying roaches which the police officers hoped to seize on a “no case” basis and destroy themselves, with no legal consequences to the appellant whatsoever, did not remotely approach s. 11(7)’s threshold of exigency. No urgency compelled immediate action in order to preserve evidence. Nor, just as importantly, did the circumstances presented by the appellant’s admission to having some partially consumed roaches, coupled with the police officers’ wish to seize them on a no case basis, make it impracticable to obtain a warrant. Inconvenient or impractic<i>al</i>, perhaps. But s. 11(7) is not satisfied by mere inconvenience, but impractic<i>ability</i>. In this case, the police had a practicable option: to arrest the appellant and obtain a warrant to enter the residence and seize the roaches. If, as the Crown says, the situation was not serious enough to arrest and apply for a warrant, then it cannot have been serious enough to intrude into a private residence without a warrant.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par40" class="">40</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There remains the matter of officer safety. As the Court of Appeal observed, Constable Bell’s entry behind Constable Dykeman was motivated out of concern for Constable Dykeman’s safety. Given the report from C.W.’s mother about the possibility of the appellant having a shotgun, this concern was well-founded. It was not, however, that concern which prompted Constable Dykeman’s entry itself. While he testified to his concern for officer safety as well as his fear that the appellant might destroy the roaches, the trial judge saw officer safety (at para. 80) as being “<span style="line-height:200%">really related to [Constables Dykeman’s and Bell’s] attempt to carry out the seizure in a less intrusive way”. In other words, concern for officer safety did not drive the decision to proceed with warrantless entry; rather, warrantless entry gave rise to concern for officer safety. While Constable Dykeman’s concern, like Constable Bell’s, was well-founded, it was not the basis for the decision to enter, but the result of the decision to enter. These facts, therefore, do not qualify as exigent circumstances making it impracticable to obtain a warrant, within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en#!fragment/sec11subsec7" target="_blank">s. 11(7)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en" target="_blank">CDSA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. </span></p>

This, he says, makes this case one of “first impression” (paras. 77 and 88).&nbsp; </span></p>

That said, neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal described it as presenting a novel legal issue, nor was this suggested to us by the Crown.&nbsp; This is unsurprising, and marks my point of respectful departure from my colleague.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is simply not a case of first impression. These police officers were not operating in unknown legal territory:&nbsp; their intention to effect a seizure on a “no case” basis was legally insignificant, in light of the well-established<i> </i>legal principles governing the authority of police to enter a residence without a warrant. The presumptive unreasonableness of warrantless searches, and the high privacy interest attaching to a person’s residence have long been fundamental to our understanding of the proper relationship between citizen and state. And, longstanding judgments of this Court — <i>Grant</i> 1993, <i>Silveira</i> and <i>Feeney</i> — have, in considering the exigency of circumstances prompting warrantless entry, required the Crown to show <i>urgency</i>, particularly in the context of the search of a residence. As the Court observed in <i>Silveira</i>, at para. 140, “[t]here is no place on earth where persons can have a greater expectation of privacy than within their ‘dwelling-house’.” Similarly, at para. 41, La&nbsp;Forest J. (in dissent, but not on this point) reiterated the high value which the law places upon the security of a home from state intrusion. It is, he said, a “bulwark for the protection of the individual against the state [which] affords the individual a measure of privacy and tranquillity against the overwhelming power of the state”.</span></p>

Even accepting, therefore, the Crown’s submission about the absence of an “ulterior purpose”, the nature of the <i>Charter</i>-infringing state conduct here was, in my view, and in light of this Court’s prior statements regarding exigent circumstances, sufficiently serious to favour exclusion of the evidence obtained as a result. </span></p>

As the Court said in <i>Grant</i> 2009 (at para. 78): “A<span style="line-height:200%">n unreasonable search that intrudes on an area in which the individual reasonably enjoys a high expectation of privacy, or that demeans his or her dignity, is more serious than one that does not.” </span></p>

While I agree that the decision by police to obtain a warrant before conducting a further search of the appellant’s residence prevented a serious impact on the appellant’s privacy interest from becoming even more serious, I also agree with the Crown that this was a “serious intrusion”, “relativ[e]” to other forms of intrusion. It is well settled that “[a]n illegal search of a house will therefore be seen as more serious at this stage of the analysis” (<i>Grant</i> 2009, at para. 113). I therefore conclude that the impact of the warrantless entry on the appellant’s rights under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> was significant.

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the societal interest in a trial on the merits weighed in favour of admitting the evidence.

The impact of the s. 8 infringement on the appellant’s interests protected thereunder was considerable, intruding into a place in which he was entitled to repose the highest expectation of privacy. But the value of the evidence to deciding the truth of the charges against the appellant is also considerable. </span></p>

As was observed in <i>Grant</i> 2009, at para. 140, “[t]he balancing mandated by s. 24(2) is qualitative in nature and therefore not capable of mathematical precision.” Indeed, because the <i>Grant</i> 2009 factors are mutually incommensurable — balancing seriousness of state conduct, seriousness of the infringement of <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights and the impact upon society’s interest in adjudication — the “balancing” will never be an entirely objective exercise. A reviewing court must, however, come to a reasoned conclusion. While the effective destruction of the Crown’s case weighs heavily, so does the <span style="line-height:

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par55" class="">55</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In weighing these considerations, my colleague relies on the seriousness of the offence to hold that excluding the evidence will be “far more likely to cause the public to lose faith and confidence in our criminal justice system” (para. 94). This is premised, however, upon a limited view of public confidence which this Court has already rejected. As the Court observed in <i>Grant</i> 2009 (at para. 84), “seriousness of the alleged offence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has the potential to cut both ways. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;[W]hile the public has a heightened interest in seeing a determination on the merits where the offence charged is serious, it also has a vital interest in having a justice system that is above reproach, particularly where the penal stakes for the accused are high.” The public interest in maintaining a justice system “above reproach” has helpfully been explained by Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. McGuffie</i>, 2016 ONCA 365, 348 O.A.C. 365, at para. 73:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">On the one hand, if the evidence at stake is reliable and important to the Crown’s case, the seriousness of the charge can be said to enhance society’s interests in an adjudication on the merits.&nbsp; On the other hand, society’s concerns that police misconduct not appear to be condoned by the courts, and that individual rights be taken seriously, come to the forefront when the consequences to those whose rights have been infringed are particularly serious .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

In this case, I find that the importance of ensuring that such conduct is not condoned by the court favours exclusion. As Doherty J.A. also said in <i>McGuffie</i>, at para. 83, “[t]he court can only adequately disassociate the justice system from the police misconduct and reinforce the community’s commitment to individual rights protected by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>by excluding the evidence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Contrary to the findings of the trial judge and three judges of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (2015 BCCA 205, 372 B.C.A.C. 148), Justice Brown finds, and I agree, that these requirements were not met and the police entry into the appellant’s apartment breached his s. 8 privacy rights. In so concluding, however, my colleague finds that the police entry was not just unlawful; he says that they knew or should have known as much — in other words, the police should have known what the trial judge and three judges of the Court of Appeal did not know.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par71" class="">71</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;My colleague then turns to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>and finds that the police conduct in breaching the appellant’s s. 8 rights was so serious, and the impact on his privacy interests so great, that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the guns and drugs and other evidence seized by the police were to be admitted into evidence — this, despite the strong findings of the trial judge, which no one challenges, that the police were acting in good faith throughout and that their conduct was designed to spare the appellant the trouble of being arrested for a few roaches of marihuana that they intended to seize on a “no case” basis.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par72" class="">72</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see this matter very differently than my colleague. The function of this Court, in a case like the present one, is to clarify the law so that police officers, defence and Crown counsel, trial and appellate judges and the public at large can know what the law is and how it is to be applied in future cases. It is not to judge the police conduct against a standard that exceeds the wisdom and training of experienced trial and appellate judges.</p>

Rather, in the circumstances, the police had three options available to them. They could have (1) tried to obtain the appellant’s lawful consent to enter his apartment and seize the roaches; (2) arrested the appellant and obtained a warrant to search his apartment and seize the roaches; or (3) thrown up their hands and walked away, in dereliction of their duty to seize illicit drugs, even if only to catalogue and destroy them.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par74" class="">74</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, in my respectful view, it is hardly fair to castigate the police for their conduct when prior to this case, the legal boundaries of s. 11(7) in the context of a “no case” seizure were at best unclear. One need only look to the lower court decisions to realize this.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par75" class="">75</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Brown takes a different view. He does not accept that the “no case” component added any novelty to the legal analysis of s. 11(7). In his view, the police “were not operating in unknown legal territory” (para. 46). According to my colleague (para. 39):</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:27.2pt">. . . the prospect of the appellant destroying roaches which the police officers hoped to seize on a “no case” basis and destroy themselves, with no legal consequences to the appellant whatsoever, <u>did not remotely approach s. 11(7)’s threshold of exigency</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par76" class="">76</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot accept my colleague’s assessment. It involves hindsight reasoning on a matter of some complexity — the interpretation of s. 11(7) in the context of a “no case” seizure — and does a disservice to the reasoning of the lower courts in which the “no case” component played a crucial role in their determination that the police entry into the appellant’s apartment without a warrant was lawful.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par77" class="">77</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the lower courts focused on the “no case” component comes as no surprise. To my knowledge, this is the first case in which a court has been called upon to interpret s. 11(7) in the context of a “no case” seizure. In other words, it is a case of first impression. Just as this Court is now tasked, for the first time, with determining the meaning and application of the words “exigent circumstances” and “impracticable” in the context of a “no case” seizure under s. 11(7), so too were the lower courts. And as I will explain, their decisions, though ultimately found by this Court to be in error, were both thoughtful and carefully reasoned.</p>
 <p class="Title2LevelTitre2Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">A.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reasons of the Trial Judge</p>

The trial judge then explained why, in his view, exigent circumstances existed on the facts of this case (para. 75):</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:27.2pt">. . . in the case at bar the police had: (1) reasonable grounds to believe that there was a quantity, albeit a small quantity, of a controlled substance in the accused’s apartment, based on the smell detected when he opened a door as well as his admission, and thus they had grounds to obtain a search warrant; and (2) there was a reasonable basis for their belief that the controlled substance would be lost, destroyed or consumed <u>given that they did not intend to arrest the accused for possession of this amount of marihuana and accordingly he would have remained in the apartment</u>. I am therefore satisfied that the requirement for “exigent circumstances” is met. [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par79" class="">79</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge next considered the impracticability of obtaining a warrant in these circumstances. Following <i>R. v. Erickson</i>, 2003 BCCA 693, 192 B.C.A.C. 203, he defined the word “impracticable” as “something less than impossible [that] imports a large measure of practicality, what may be termed common sense” (para. 76, citing <i>Erickson</i>, at para. 33). He then stated the following, at para. 77:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:27.2pt">. . . I conclude that by reason of the exigent circumstances in this case, it was impracticable to obtain a search warrant such that seizure of the controlled substance under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en#!fragment/sec11subsec7" target="_blank">s. 11(7)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en" target="_blank">CDSA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>was justified.</p>

To characterize it as being insignificant to the resolution of the legal issues in this case, as my colleague does, is to ignore the trial judge’s explicit reasoning to the contrary.</p>

Like the trial judge, the Court of Appeal was alive to the meaning of “exigent circumstances” and “impracticable”. Indeed, in defining “exigent circumstances”, the court referred to and quoted from two of the three authorities which my colleague identifies as governing — <i>R. v. Grant</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, and <i>R. v. Feeney</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13.</p>

In rejecting that submission, the court quoted from para. 232 of <i>R. v. M. (N.)</i> (2007), 223 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (Ont. S.C.J.), in which Hill J. catalogued all of the leading authorities, including <i>R. v.

In my view, clearly there were. The police smelled marihuana and Mr. Paterson admitted having marihuana in the premises. <u>Mr. Paterson was in the premises, and the police had no intention of arresting him. I note, parenthetically, that the trial judge was alive to the possibility that the police were creating a situation so they could enter the apartment without a warrant, and found that they had not done so. He accepted their evidence that they only wanted to seize the “roaches”, and then would be on their way in a “no case” seizure. Had they left Mr. Paterson to obtain a warrant, he could have easily destroyed the roaches.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">As is apparent, the “no case” component played a central role in the court’s “exigent circumstances” analysis.</p>

The court then returned to the import of the “no case” seizure and made the following significant observation at para. 74:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:27.2pt"><u>In this case, the police would have had to arrest Mr. Paterson, a much greater interference with his liberty rights, and obtain a warrant to seize the roaches. The police weighed these options, and concluded that it was not practical (in my words) to take those steps for what they believed would be a “no case” seizure.</u> In these circumstances, the trial judge concluded that it was impracticable to obtain a warrant, and there is no basis to interfere with this finding.

And that brings me to the feature of this case — legal uncertainty — which I consider to be crucial in assessing whether the conduct of the police here was so serious and so intrusive of the appellant’s privacy rights that the drugs and loaded firearms located in the appellant’s apartment should be excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> on the basis that their admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>

To put the matter succinctly, there was no immediate risk of the roaches being destroyed that the police could not have prevented without resorting to a warrantless entry into the appellant’s apartment. In other words, exigent circumstances did not exist. In my view, the word “exigent” connotes urgency — nothing more — and there was no genuine urgency here. The police could have arrested the appellant and obtained a warrant to search his premises. While proceeding that way would have been inconvenient and involved an intrusion of some significance on the appellant’s liberty interest — particularly when this was a “no case” seizure in which the police did not intend to charge the appellant — inconvenience and the anticipated loss of liberty occasioned by it cannot convert non-exigent circumstances into exigent circumstances. As stated earlier, the police had three options available to them in the circumstances: (1) seek the appellant’s lawful consent to enter the apartment and seize the roaches; (2) arrest the appellant and obtain a search warrant; or (3) forget about the roaches and walk away, in dereliction of their duty to seize illicit drugs, even if only to catalogue and destroy them.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par88" class="">88</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I do not find the legal analysis of exigency under s. 11(7) in the context of a “no case” seizure to be straightforward or obvious at all. In this regard, I have gone to some length to show how the “no case” component figured prominently in the decisions of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal — and understandably so. As indicated, this a case of first impression. The law was unsettled at the time the police entered the apartment. One only need compare this Court’s analysis of it with that of the lower courts to realize this.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par89" class="">89</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague disagrees. He says this case is not one of first impression. It posed no new legal issues. The police were not acting in “unknown legal territory” (para. 46). They were well aware of the legal principles that governed their entry into a residence in the context of a “no case” seizure — and, in entering the appellant’s apartment without a warrant, they either wilfully breached those well-settled principles or ignored them (paras. 45-46). He further maintains that the “no case” component did not feature prominently in the legal analysis which led the trial judge and the Court of Appeal to find that the police entry was lawful. Rather, both courts merely “mentioned” it “while considering the police officers’ good faith . . . and the level of intrusiveness of the search, relative to an arrest” (para. 46 (citation omitted)). Like the police, they too were perfectly aware of the governing law, which was both clear and settled.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par90" class="">90</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case of the police, my colleague relies on this line of reasoning to show that their misconduct was very serious — that they knew or should have known that they had no authority to enter the appellant’s apartment without a warrant, and yet they did so in wanton or reckless disregard of his privacy rights. What he does not, and cannot explain, is why the lower courts, also well versed in the settled law, failed to apply it.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par91" class="">91</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The answer, in my respectful view, is plain. The law governing a “no case” seizure in the context of s. 11(7) was not clear and settled and the decisions of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal attest to this. They show, clearly and decisively, that both courts placed considerable emphasis on the “no case” component in determining that the police entry into the appellant’s apartment was lawful.&nbsp; Much as my colleague contends otherwise, he can point to no authority that even addresses the “no case” component in this context, let alone one that supposedly settles the law.</p>

I emphasize this uncertainty because over the past number of years, this Court has consistently held that legal uncertainty is a factor which a court may take into account in assessing the seriousness of a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>breach occasioned by police conduct. Where the law is evolving or in a state of uncertainty, and where the police are found to have acted in good faith, without ignorance or wilful or flagrant disregard of an accused’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights, the seriousness of the breach may be attenuated: see <i>R. v.

The seriousness of the breach is, in my view, clearly attenuated by the uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en#!fragment/sec11subsec7" target="_blank">s. 11(7)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1996-c-19-en" target="_blank">CDSA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> in the context of a “no case” seizure, and the strong findings of the trial judge that the police were acting in good faith throughout.</p>

The police, acting in good faith, made a mistake about their authority to enter the appellant’s apartment under the auspices of s. 11(7) in a “no case” seizure — the same mistake that both the trial judge and the British Columbia Court of Appeal made. In these circumstances, I fail to see how the admission of the evidence found in the appellant’s apartment would cause the public to lose faith in the criminal justice system and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.&nbsp; If anything, it is the exclusion of reliable and crucial evidence implicating the appellant in very serious gun and drug offences that is far more likely to cause the public to lose faith and confidence in our criminal justice system.</p>

However, I note that the impugned evidence was lawfully discoverable. Had the police obtained a warrant to seize the roaches, they would have discovered the drugs and guns. Bearing in mind that the police were acting in good faith throughout and that there was no deliberate flouting of the appellant’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights, this attenuates the impact of the breach on the appellant’s privacy interests: <i>Cole</i>, at paras. 89 and 93. I am therefore not persuaded that this factor is sufficient to tip the scales in favour of exclusion.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par96" class="">96</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, it is the cumulative effect of the legal uncertainty, police good faith, and the discoverability and reliability of critical evidence needed for there to be a trial on the merits that resolves the balance in favour of admitting the evidence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par97" class="">97</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In holding that the evidence of the drugs and guns should be admitted, I should not be taken as condoning police misconduct or failing to take seriously the individual rights of the appellant. I recognize that we must be vigilant in protecting against wilful, deliberate, and even in some cases, negligent misconduct on the part of the police. But that is not this case. Excluding reliable evidence required to prove serious criminal charges in circumstances where the police, acting in good faith, made a mistake in believing that they could enter the appellant’s apartment without a warrant — the very mistake that the trial judge and the Court of Appeal made — does nothing to promote public confidence in the administration of justice.&nbsp; On the contrary, it betrays that confidence.</p>
