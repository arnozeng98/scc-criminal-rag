 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criminal law — Evidence — Admissibility — Hearsay — Drug purchase call — Implied Assertions — Implied assertion tendered for the truth of its contents — Applicability of hearsay rule —</i> <i>Purposive approach</i> <i>— </i><i>Principled analysis of its necessity and reliability.</i></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After B was arrested, a caller telephoned B’s cell phone to arrange for a drug delivery. &nbsp;A police officer answered B’s cell phone and agreed to deliver the drugs at the price that B usually charged.&nbsp; The caller gave his address. &nbsp;No effort was made to find and interview him and he was not called as a witness.&nbsp; The trial judge concluded that the police officer’s testimony was not hearsay and admitted the contents of the call. &nbsp;B was convicted of possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. &nbsp;A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, ordered a new trial, and held that the evidence should not have been admitted.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Held</i>: &nbsp;The appeal should be dismissed and a new trial ordered.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</i> McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Karakatsanis and Wagner&nbsp;JJ.: &nbsp;The hearsay rule reflects the value our criminal justice system places on live, in‑court testimony. &nbsp;The defining features of hearsay are (1)&nbsp;the fact that the statement is adduced to prove the truth of its contents and (2)&nbsp;the absence of a contemporaneous opportunity to cross‑examine the declarant. &nbsp;Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible as a matter of law.&nbsp; The issue here is whether this exclusionary rule applies to express hearsay only, or to implied hearsay as well. &nbsp;An implied assertion tendered for the truth of its contents does not stand on a different footing, with respect to the hearsay rule, than an explicit assertion to the same effect. &nbsp;The principled reasons for their presumptive inadmissibility apply equally to both. &nbsp;There is no principled reason, in determining their admissibility, to distinguish between express and implied assertions adduced for the truth of their content.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless it falls under a traditional exception to the hearsay rule. &nbsp;If hearsay evidence does not fall under a hearsay exception, it may still be admitted if, pursuant to the principled analysis, sufficient indicia of reliability and necessity are established on a <i>voir dire</i>. &nbsp;Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible because of the difficulties inherent in testing the reliability of the declarant’s assertion. &nbsp;The need for a functional approach to implied assertions is readily apparent, bearing in mind the core hearsay dangers of the declarant’s perception, memory, narration and sincerity.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, no traditional exception applies and the impugned evidence withers on a principled analysis. &nbsp;This was a single drug purchase call of uncertain reliability. &nbsp;No effort was made to find and interview the caller, still less to call him as a witness — where the assertion imputed to him could have been evaluated by the trier of fact in the light of cross‑examination and the benefit of observing his demeanour. &nbsp;Although this drug purchase call does not withstand scrutiny under the principled approach, this need not always be the case with drug purchase calls.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the curative proviso of s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> can have no application in this case, since it cannot be said that there is no reasonable possibility the verdict would have been different had the telephone call not been admitted.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</i> Moldaver&nbsp;J.: &nbsp;An implied assertion of a factual proposition is part of the “contents” of a statement for purposes of the hearsay rule.&nbsp; Accordingly, the evidence of the drug purchase call was hearsay because it was introduced to prove that B was in fact a drug trafficker.&nbsp; In such cases, however, the real concern under the principled approach is reliability and it should be the focus of the inquiry. &nbsp;The necessity criterion has its purpose, but it is not meant to stifle the admission of reliable evidence. &nbsp;Rather, it is founded on society’s interest in getting at the truth. &nbsp;For that reason, in cases such as this one — where the prospect of locating, identifying, and receiving accurate information from a forthcoming and cooperative caller is remote — if the evidence is reliable, it should be admitted because its reception into evidence will be necessary in order to get closer to the truth. &nbsp;If the evidence is not reliable, it should be excluded.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The starting point is that a long line of cases have admitted evidence similar to that at issue here on the basis that it was non-hearsay.&nbsp; Because judges are not in the habit of admitting evidence they deem unreliable, these earlier cases appear to rest on the conclusion that drug purchase calls are reliable more often than not and, thus, can safely be categorized as non-hearsay.&nbsp; Even where such evidence was excluded, the concern was reliability.&nbsp; The common thread in these cases is that the evidence’s reliability dictated the answer with respect to admissibility — and that is the assessment courts should focus on.</p>

margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority’s analogy to an earlier decision of this Court to support its conclusion that the police should have tried to find and interview the caller breaks down upon scrutiny. &nbsp;There, the police were dealing with a known declarant who was fully cooperative and forthcoming. &nbsp;Here, the declarant was unknown. &nbsp;Apart from officer safety concerns, the likelihood of the police finding the declarant would seem slim.&nbsp; And the prospect of the declarant being forthcoming and cooperative, if found, would seem even slimmer. &nbsp;The necessity criterion was thus met.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is perfectly consistent with the principled approach that even a single drug purchase call may meet the threshold test for reliability, the Crown failed in this case to establish that the call meets the test justifying its admission as substantive evidence that B was engaged in drug trafficking. &nbsp;Even if the caller was entirely sincere in his belief that B was a drug dealer, that does not address why the caller believed what he believed — and whether his belief was in fact true or not.&nbsp; This is not a case of multiple calls, where common sense tells us that the probability of numerous callers all being mistaken is unlikely. &nbsp;Nor do we have sufficient indicia of reliability, either within the statement or in the form of confirmatory evidence outside the statement.&nbsp; Had the circumstances been somewhat different, there may well have been a satisfactory basis for evaluating whether the caller believed B was a drug dealer and whether that belief was in fact true. &nbsp;That is what threshold reliability requires.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">Our adversary system puts a premium on the calling of witnesses, who testify under oath or solemn affirmation, whose demeanour can be observed by the trier of fact, and whose testimony can be tested by cross-examination.&nbsp; We regard this process as the optimal way of testing testimonial evidence.&nbsp; Because hearsay evidence comes in a different form, it raises particular concerns.&nbsp; The general exclusionary rule is a recognition of the difficulty for a trier of fact to assess what weight, if any, is to be given to a statement made by a person who has not been seen or heard, and who has not been subject to the test of cross-examination.&nbsp; The fear is that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it deserves.&nbsp;</p>

H. Wigmore explains:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">The theory of the Hearsay rule . . . is that the many possible sources of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness which may lie underneath the bare untested assertion of a witness can best be brought to light and exposed, if they exist, by the test of cross-examination.&nbsp; But this test or security may in a given instance be superfluous; it may be sufficiently clear, in that instance, that the statement offered is free from the risk of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness, so that the test of cross-examination would be a work of supererogation.&nbsp; Moreover, the test may be impossible of employment — for example, by reason of the death of the declarant —, so that, if his testimony is to be used at all, there is a necessity for taking it in the untested shape.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">Looked at from the point of view of the four hearsay dangers, there is a much reduced risk of lies if the declarant did not intend to convey that which his statement is relied upon to prove, particularly if he it [<i>sic</i>] was not his purpose to make a representation of fact at all.&nbsp; But the other hearsay dangers remain, that is, the risk of misperception, false memory (unless the implied assertion concerns the declarant’s own state of mind) and ambiguity.&nbsp; Indeed the last danger may be magnified.&nbsp; When X says:&nbsp; “Is Z in there?” does this imply that Z is not with X and nothing more, or that Z is not with X and X wants Z, or Z is in danger, or X wants to know where Z is?&nbsp; <i>The upshot is that in many situations implied assertions depend for their value on the reliability of the declarant just as much as express assertions</i>.

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Moreover, even insincerity remains a concern with implied assertions:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the justification for the assertive/nonassertive distinction is the absence of the insincerity problem, and through that guarantee of sincerity a reduced level of perception, memory, and ambiguity problems, this justification cannot be applied to implied statements from speech.&nbsp; Speech is a mechanism of communication; it is virtually always used for the purpose of communicating something to someone.&nbsp; It is illogical to conclude that the question of sincerity is eliminated and that the problem of unreliability is reduced for unintended implications of speech if that speech might have been insincere in the first instance, relative to the direct message intentionally communicated.&nbsp; If potential insincerity is injected into the utterance of words that form the basis for the implied communication, the implication from the speech is as untrustworthy as the utterance upon which it is based.&nbsp; [Rice, at p. 534]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge characterized as hearsay, and excluded for that reason, evidence of the police officer’s conversation with the person who had answered his call.&nbsp; On an appeal by the Crown, the Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed.&nbsp; It found that the impugned conversation was admissible as “part of the narrative”, since “[i]t was impossible to understand the development of the later events without the evidence of the telephone conversation which preceded them” ((1996), 193 A.R. 149, at para. 3).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see nothing in <i>Ly</i> to suggest — let alone decide — that an implied assertion tendered for the truth of its contents stands on a different footing, with respect to the hearsay rule, than an explicit assertion to the same effect.&nbsp; Unlike <i>Ly</i>, that is the issue here.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And the issue now comes before us for the first time, though it has for at least half a century divided lower courts in several provinces:&nbsp; see, for example, <i>R. v. Fialkow</i>, [1963] 2 C.C.C. 42 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Edwards</i>; <i>Wilson</i>; <i>R. v. Lucia</i>, 2010 ONCA 533 (CanLII); <i>R. v. Cook </i>(1978), 10 B.C.L.R. 84 (C.A.); <i>R. v.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Canada, Parliament has not found it necessary or appropriate to adopt legislation classifying implied assertions as non-hearsay.&nbsp; This is, of course, entirely understandable in view of our principled and more flexible approach to exclusion.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . if the inquirer had said in the course of making his request, “I would like my usual supply of amphetamine at the price which I paid you last week” . . ., the hearsay rule prevents the prosecution from calling police officers to recount the conversation which I have described. . . .</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If [however] the simple request or requests for drugs to be supplied by the appellant, as recounted by the police, contains in substance, but only by implication, the same assertion, then I can find neither authority nor principle to suggest that the hearsay rule should not be equally applicable and exclude such evidence.&nbsp; What is sought to be done is to use the oral assertion, even though it may be an implied assertion, as evidence of the truth of the proposition asserted.&nbsp; That the proposition is asserted by way of necessary implication rather than expressly cannot, to my mind, make any difference.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two main reasons have been urged against applying the hearsay rule to implied assertions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as Watt. J.A. states (at para. 83) and as the Crown argues, excluding implied assertions as hearsay has the potential of broadening the exclusionary rule, given that “[v]irtually every human action is based on some set of assumptions implicitly accepted and, on this approach, ‘asserted’ by the actor” (A.F., at para. 62, quoting <i>McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence</i> (4th ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 7-21).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as critics of <i>Kearley </i>have pointed out, applying the hearsay rule to implied assertions such as drug purchase calls has the potential to deprive the trier of fact of reliable evidence and thereby impede the truth-finding process:&nbsp; see, for example, D. Birch, “Criminal Justice Act 2003 (4) Hearsay:&nbsp; Same Old Story, Same Old Song?”, [2004] <i>Crim. L.R.</i> 556, at pp. 564-65.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The short answer to the first argument is that we are not concerned on this appeal with the application of the hearsay rule to assertions implied through non-verbal conduct.&nbsp; Our concern, rather, is with a quintessentially <i>verbal</i> statement.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of the applicability of the hearsay rule to inferences that can be drawn from non-verbal conduct is best left for another day.&nbsp; For present purposes, I find it sufficient to say that “one can engage in conduct without ever intending to communicate <i>anything</i> to <i>anyone</i> [but] the same is not true of speech or a combination of speech and conduct (for example, placing a bet) because the sole purpose of speech is communication”:&nbsp; Rice, at p. 536 (emphasis in original).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second concern mentioned above is greatly attenuated, I again emphasize, by Canada’s principled approach to hearsay.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Kearley</i>, having found the evidence in that case to be hearsay, it was automatically excluded because it did not fall within a traditional exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Canadian approach suffers from no such inflexibility.&nbsp; Under our law, hearsay evidence that is not admissible under a traditional exception may nonetheless be admitted pursuant to a principled analysis of its necessity and reliability.&nbsp; This “sensible scheme” recognizes that “some implied assertions, like some express assertions, will be highly reliable even in the absence of cross-examination”:&nbsp; Finman, at p. 693.&nbsp; Pursuant to its terms, implied assertions that are necessary and reliable may be admitted while those that are unreliable or unnecessary will be excluded.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Khelawon</i>, necessity was conceded.&nbsp; Justice Charron nonetheless took care to note that</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">in an appropriate case, the court in deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the proponent of the evidence made all reasonable efforts to secure the evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the other party.&nbsp; [para. 104]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN">This is the kind of “appropriate case” contemplated by <i>Khelawon</i>.&nbsp; And the answer is that the police <i>made no effort at all</i> to secure the evidence of the declarant: they never sought to interview or even find him, though <i>he gave them his address</i>.&nbsp; Moreover, there was no explanation offered as to why no efforts were made to locate the declarant.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is the single telephone call in this case sufficiently reliable.&nbsp; As Feldman J.A. found in the court below, “[t]here was no basis to say that the caller’s belief was reliable without testing the basis for that belief by cross-examination” (para. 146).&nbsp; Indeed, this is not a situation “in which it can be easily seen that such a required test [i.e., cross-examination] would add little as a security, because its purposes had been already substantially accomplished”:&nbsp; <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 62, quoting <i>Wigmore on Evidence</i>,<i> </i>at §1420.<i> </i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concluding as I have, I take care not to be understood to have proposed a categorical rule for drug purchase calls.&nbsp; Although the call at issue here does not withstand scrutiny under the principled approach, this need not always be the case.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, where the police intercept not one but several drug purchase calls, the quantity of the calls might well suffice in some circumstances to establish reliability — indeed, while “[o]ne or two might [be] mistaken, or might even have conspired to frame the defendant as a dealer”, it would “def[y] belief that all the callers had made the same error or were all party to the same conspiracy”: I. H. Dennis, <i>The Law of Evidence</i> (4th ed. 2010), at p. 708.</p>

B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, and <i>R. v. U. (F.J.)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764.</p>

IV, at p. 127).&nbsp; In counsel’s words, “the cell phone call placing the order seals the story as far as I’m concerned” (p. 138).&nbsp; Moreover, the trial judge referred to the phone call in his reasons for judgment and took it into account when assessing Mr. Baldree’s credibility (A.R., vol.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I write separately, however, to underscore my reservations with Part VII of my colleague’s reasons, which deal with the criteria of necessity and reliability under the principled approach.&nbsp; In particular, I am concerned by my colleague’s approach to necessity.&nbsp; That criterion has its purpose, but we ought not to approach it as a box that must invariably be checked off before drug purchase calls like this one can be admitted.&nbsp; In such cases, the real concern is reliability — and that, in my respectful view, should be the focus of our inquiry.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point is the recognition that we are today characterizing as hearsay — and thus presumptively inadmissible — evidence which has long been received by the courts as circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; It is not a step to be undertaken lightly.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I believe it is the right one.&nbsp; As my colleague observes, the characterization of a particular piece of evidence as hearsay should not hinge on the declarant’s particular choice of words (paras. 42-43).&nbsp; Rather, the focus should be on the existence (or non-existence) of the hearsay dangers having regard to the purpose for which the out-of-court statement is being tendered.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I agree that judges must satisfy themselves of the reliability of drug purchase calls on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; If the evidence is reliable, it should be admitted <i>because its reception will be necessary in order to get closer to the truth</i>.&nbsp; If it is not reliable, the evidence should stay out.&nbsp; The only difference between yesterday and today should be that in characterizing implied assertions as hearsay, we avoid the thorny debate about what the declarant did or did not intend to assert and, instead, put the focus on what truly matters in cases such as this one:&nbsp; “. . . whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception” (A. W. Bryant, S. N. Lederman and&nbsp;M.&nbsp;K. Fuerst, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada </i>(3rd ed. 2009), at p. 244).&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Concern Is Threshold Reliability</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to set the stage for the following discussion by clarifying what is actually at issue.&nbsp; Here, I am speaking only of <i>threshold</i> reliability, not <i>ultimate</i> reliability.&nbsp; At this point, a court is concerned only with whether the call exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact “a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement” (<i>R. v. Hawkins</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, at para. 75).&nbsp; Threshold reliability exists because of a “fear . . . that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it deserves” (<i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 35).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But once threshold reliability is established, ultimate reliability — including what weight, if any, to attach to the evidence — is a matter for the trier of fact. &nbsp;As Charron J. observed in <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 50:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Whether the hearsay statement will or will not be ultimately relied upon in deciding the issues in the case is a matter for the trier of fact to determine at the conclusion of the trial based on a consideration of the statement in the context of the entirety of the evidence.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Historical Treatment of Drug Purchase Calls</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Watt J.A. observed in his dissenting reasons at the Court of Appeal, the question about drug purchase calls — in particular, whether they may contain an implied assertion — “has played little or no role” in the jurisprudence to date (2012 ONCA 138, 109 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 53).&nbsp; Nonetheless, as my colleague Fish J. points out, a long line of cases have admitted evidence similar to the evidence under consideration here on the basis that it was non-hearsay (para. 54).&nbsp; See, e.g., <i>R. v. Owad</i> (1951), 102 C.C.C. 155 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Fialkow</i>, [1963] 2 C.C.C. 42 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Cook</i> (1978), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 318 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Edwards</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 239 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Nguyen</i>, 2003 BCCA 556, 188 B.C.A.C. 218; <i>R. v. Williams</i>, 2009 BCCA 284, 273 B.C.A.C. 86; <i>R. v. Lucia</i>, 2010 ONCA 533 (CanLII); <i>R. v. Graham</i>, 2013 BCCA 75 (CanLII).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These decisions give me pause.&nbsp; Can we have been wrong for so long?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because I think it safe to conclude that judges are not in the habit of admitting evidence they deem unreliable, I am led to believe that these earlier cases rest on the conclusion — often unstated, but sometimes explicit — that drug purchase calls are inherently reliable.&nbsp; It may be that these decisions reflect an implicit judicial consensus, emerging from multiple decisions over multiple decades, that because<i> </i>such evidence is reliable more often than not, it can safely be categorized as non-hearsay.&nbsp; Feldman J.A. made a similar point in her reasons (para. 131).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case of <i>Edwards</i> offers a helpful example of an explicit conclusion as to the reliability of these calls.&nbsp; In that case, the issue was whether “a number of calls [to the accused’s phone] from people ordering small amounts of crack cocaine” were admissible to prove the accused was a drug dealer (p. 243).&nbsp; Although McKinlay J.A. concluded that the evidence was not being introduced to prove the truth of its contents and thus was not hearsay, in the alternative, she held that the evidence was admissible under the principled approach:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">In my view, the evidence in issue fulfils these criteria. It was necessary to prove the nature of the appellant’s drug activities, and they could not have been proven in this case in any other way that was available to the police. They did not know the identity of the callers, and, in any event, it is unlikely the callers would have testified if their identity had been known. <u>The evidence is reliable, because it was made under circumstances which negate the possibility that the requests were spurious ones. The callers were led to believe that the persons to whom they were speaking (the police) were speaking on behalf of the appellant.</u> [Emphasis added; p. 249.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the extent the other cases reflect McKinlay J.A.’s view about the reliability of such calls, they align with explicit conclusions to the same effect made by regulation or statute in other jurisdictions.&nbsp; See, e.g., <i>Federal Rules of Evidence </i>(U.S.), Rule 801; <i>Criminal Justice Act 2003 </i>(U.K.), 2003, c. 44, s. 115.&nbsp; As one leading treatise on the U.S. <i>Federal Rules of Evidence</i> observed in explaining the Rules’ blanket exclusion of implied assertions from the definition of hearsay:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">. . . when a person acts in a way consistent with a belief but without intending by his act to communicate that belief, <u>one of the principal reasons</u> for the hearsay rule — to exclude declarations whose veracity cannot be tested by cross-examination — does not apply, because the declarant’s sincerity is not then involved. [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">See also <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> (7th ed. 2013), vol. 2 (arguing the Rule 801 definition is “a compromise between theory and the need for a relatively simple and workable definition in situations where hearsay dangers are generally reduced”, at pp. 208-9); I. H. Dennis, <i>The Law of Evidence</i> (4th ed. 2010) (arguing that because “hearsay dangers are often significantly reduced in cases of implied assertions, there is no compelling systemic reason for applying the hearsay rule to them”, at p. 710).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Law Reform Commission of Canada’s proposed <i>Evidence Code</i> of 1975 proceeded on the same basis.&nbsp; Its definition of hearsay thus excluded implied assertions, whether verbal or non-verbal.&nbsp; See <i>Evidence Code</i>, s. 27(2)(<i>b</i>) in <i>Report on Evidence</i> (1975).&nbsp; The commissioners — including Antonio Lamer, who would go on to become a principal architect of the principled approach to hearsay — concluded:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">Under the definition, . . . a person’s words or conduct are not hearsay if he did not intend them to be assertive. In assessing the reliability of such evidence account may have to be taken of the dangers of hearsay evidence. . . . <u>[U]nlike conscious assertions, a person is seldom likely to be deliberately misleading when he engaged in non-assertive activity, which is the most important danger associated with hearsay.</u> In defining hearsay to exclude non-assertive conduct the Code follows the better view of the present law.

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">It is only where the statement is offered as the basis for the inferences, first, that the declarant <i>believed</i> it, and, second, that the facts were in accordance with his belief, that the evidence is hearsay. [Emphasis in original.]</p>

Schiff, “Evidence — Hearsay and the Hearsay Rule: A Functional View” (1978), 56 <i>Can. Bar Rev.</i> 674, at p. 683, fn. 33 (criticizing the <i>Evidence Code</i> definition for “ignor[ing] every reason for the hearsay rule except the danger that the declarant may have been insincere”).</p>

Wilson</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.).&nbsp; In that case, the Crown sought to tender evidence that while the police were at the accused’s home, “a man came to the door asking for ‘Rob’ and seeking to buy drugs” (p. 104).&nbsp; The accused’s name was Robert Wilson.&nbsp; The trial judge admitted the evidence on the strength of <i>Edwards</i>, but the Court of Appeal reversed.&nbsp; McMurtry C.J.O. reasoned that it was “dangerous” and “unsafe” to draw an inference that the accused was a drug dealer from a single visit (pp. 104-5).&nbsp;</p>

M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence </i>(6th ed. 2011), at pp. 111-12; Dennis, at pp. 707-9.</p>

 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>What Is the Role of Necessity?</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn then to the question of necessity.&nbsp; It bears recalling that “the <u>central reason</u> for the presumptive exclusion of hearsay statements is the general inability to test their reliability” (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 2 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; That, of course, is not to suggest that we have ousted necessity as a prerequisite to the admission of hearsay evidence.&nbsp; We have not.&nbsp; But what we have said is that “necessity and reliability should not be considered in isolation” because “[o]ne criterion may have an impact on the other” (para. 77).&nbsp; Indeed, we have recognized that “[i]n the interest of seeking the truth, the very high reliability of [a] statement <u>[can render] its substantive admission necessary</u>” (para. 86 (emphasis added), citing <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, and <i>R. v. U. (F.J.)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764).&nbsp; That is the principle I would apply here.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[97]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague, however, sees a broader role for necessity in cases such as this one.&nbsp; He quotes Charron J. in <i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 104, for the proposition that “<u>in an appropriate case</u>, the court in deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the proponent of the evidence made <u>all reasonable efforts</u> to secure the evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the other party” (emphasis added).&nbsp; On that basis, he concludes, at para. 68:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC"><u>This is the kind of “appropriate case” contemplated by <i>Khelawon</i>.</u>&nbsp; And the answer is that the police <i>made no effort at all</i> to secure the evidence of the declarant: they never sought to interview or even find him, though <i>he gave them his address</i>.&nbsp; [Italics in original; underlining added.]</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC"><u>Although Mr. Skupien was elderly and frail at the time he made the allegations, there is no evidence that the Crown attempted to preserve his evidence by application under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec709" target="_blank">ss. 709<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> to<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec714" target="_blank"> 714<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</i></u> He did not testify at the preliminary hearing. The record does not disclose if he had died by that time. In making these comments, I do not question the fact that it was necessary for the Crown to resort to Mr. Skupien’s evidence in hearsay form. Necessity is conceded. <u>However, in an appropriate case, the court in deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the proponent of the evidence made all reasonable efforts to secure the evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the other party.</u> That issue is not raised here.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[102]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And that, in my respectful view, is where the analogy to <i>Khelawon </i>breaks down.&nbsp; In <i>Khelawon</i>, the police were dealing with a known declarant who was fully cooperative and forthcoming.&nbsp; Here, the declarant was unknown and even if the police had been able to find him — a big “if” — there is no reason to believe that he would have been forthcoming and cooperative.&nbsp; Indeed, the opposite is more likely to be true.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[103]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With that in mind, it bears recalling that, as Charron J. herself observed shortly after <i>Khelawon</i>, the test for necessity is not whether the hearsay statement is the best form of the evidence (for that will always be live testimony), but whether it is the “best <u>available</u> form” in the circumstances (<i>R. v. Couture</i>, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at para. 79 (emphasis added)).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[104]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question that arises then is:&nbsp; Should we be requiring the police, in the name of necessity, to track down unknown and often unknowable declarants, who are unlikely to be found and unlikely to be forthcoming and cooperative in the event they are found?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The answer, I believe, is found in <i>Edwards</i>, where McKinlay J.A. observed:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">[The police] did not know the identity of the callers, and, in any event, it is unlikely the callers would have testified if their identity had been known. [p. 249]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">In my respectful view, McKinlay J.A.’s logic remains sound, even on the facts here.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it is true the police in this case had the benefit of the caller’s address, the caller’s identity was still unknown.&nbsp; Surely, the police were not going to show up at 327 Guy St. and ask who there was looking to buy drugs from Chris Baldree.&nbsp; Apart from officer safety concerns, the likelihood of the police finding the declarant would seem slim.&nbsp; And the prospect of the declarant being forthcoming and cooperative, if found, would seem even slimmer.&nbsp; An undercover drug buy would be even more problematic, given the number of officers who would be needed to see it through and the obvious risks to the officer safety inherent in such an operation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under either option, the game would hardly be worth the candle.&nbsp; And that, in my view, provides a full answer to the concern that the police offered no explanation as to why they made no efforts to locate the declarant.&nbsp; With respect, no explanation was necessary — common sense provides one.&nbsp; If there is little chance of finding the declarant, and little chance that, if found, he or she will be forthcoming and provide the police with evidence in a better form than the call itself (such as a <i>B.&nbsp;(K.G.)</i> statement or testimony in court), the necessity criterion will have been met.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Equally problematic is the suggestion by my colleague that <i>even where there are multiple callers</i>, the police could be expected to go out and seek to persuade <i>at least some</i> of them to testify (para. 72).&nbsp; With respect, absent evidence of collusion, I see that as being wasteful.&nbsp; It amounts to little more than tipping our hat to necessity for necessity’s sake.&nbsp; That has not been, and should not be, what the test for necessity requires.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At bottom, the point is that the necessity criterion is not meant to stifle the admission of reliable evidence.&nbsp; Rather, it is “founded on society’s interest in getting at the truth” (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 49).&nbsp; Necessity should be viewed as a servant of the truth, not its master.&nbsp; For that reason, in cases such as this one — where the prospect of locating, identifying, and receiving accurate information from a forthcoming and cooperative caller is remote — if the evidence is reliable, it should be admitted because its reception into evidence will be necessary in order to get closer to the truth.&nbsp; If the evidence is not reliable, it should be excluded.&nbsp; Either way, in my view, the focus should be reliability.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Was This Call Reliable?</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reliability of a particular hearsay statement can be tested by looking at, among other things, the circumstances in which the statement came about.&nbsp; One may look for indicia of reliability within the four corners of the statement.&nbsp; The law also provides that indicia of reliability may be found outside the statement in the form of confirmatory evidence (<i>Khelawon</i>, at para. 100).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown maintains that this call was sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception.&nbsp; In particular, the Crown relies on the absence of any evidence that “the caller was motivated by anything other than a desire to purchase drugs” and the argument that the “spontaneity of the conversation was made under circumstances where an intentional lie was remote” (A.F., at para. 82).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[112]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument has something to it.&nbsp; As I indicated above, there is good reason to believe that the sincerity hearsay danger is reduced in cases such as this one.&nbsp; That said, Mr. Baldree argues that the circumstances in which this call came about are sufficient to warrant concern that this call may have been “made to throw suspicion” on him (R.F., at para. 85).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[113]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the record reveals, there was initially some uncertainty about the respective roles of Mr. Baldree and the other Chris in this case, Christopher Anderson, as to the drugs found in the apartment.&nbsp; Sgt. Martelle testified that Mr. Anderson was known to be “deal[ing] in . . . those types of drugs” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 106).&nbsp; He was apparently a man of some repute, known “on the streets” as “the Mexican” (p. 59).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[114]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On its own, Mr. Baldree’s argument is insufficient to impugn the reliability of this call.&nbsp; He has not suggested, for example, how Mr. Anderson or anyone else could have arranged for a fabricated call when the police seized all cell phones at the time of the arrests and no persons were released by the police until <i>after</i> the call was received.&nbsp; Had either of Mr. Anderson’s two associates been released by the police <i>before </i>the call was received on Mr. Baldree’s phone, it would have been a different matter.&nbsp; But those are not our facts.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[115]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I caution thus against inferring suspicious circumstances in these types of cases absent any evidence suggesting as much.&nbsp; If that were our approach, many of our time-tested hearsay exceptions would unravel.&nbsp; To state the obvious, a dying man does not lose his ability to lie.&nbsp; And yet, in the case of dying declarations, we do not indulge in speculation about potential fabrication.&nbsp; Instead, the law recognizes that a motive to lie in such circumstances is at best remote (<i>R. v. Woodcock</i> (1789), 1 Leach 500, 168 E.R. 352 (K.B.), at p. 353).&nbsp; In other words, we recognize a norm of human behaviour for what it is — a norm.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[116]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, because our rules are not designed around theoretical possibilities but practical realities, a drug purchase call by mere dint of being a drug purchase call should not raise suspicions of fabrication.&nbsp; While the onus remains on the proponent of the evidence to establish that the evidence is sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception, I would suggest that “it falls to the person opposing the evidence to show circumstances of suspicion” (<i>R. v. Starr</i>, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 8, <i>per </i>McLachlin C.J.).&nbsp; Here, the record does not reveal a sufficient basis to worry about the circumstances in which the call to Mr. Baldree’s phone came about.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[117]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Examining the sincerity of this caller’s belief, however, does not end the matter — and ultimately this is where the Crown’s argument in this case falls short.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[118]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the Crown sought to introduce the drug purchase call to establish not merely that the caller <i>believed </i>that Mr. Baldree was a drug trafficker (evidence of limited value to the Crown’s case), but that Mr. Baldree was <i>in fact </i>a drug trafficker (evidence of significant value).&nbsp; Indeed, though he characterized it as circumstantial evidence, the trial judge here correctly recognized that the evidence was being used to establish that <i>Mr. Baldree was </i>“<i>engaged in the trafficking of drugs</i>” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 23 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; It was on the basis of <i>that</i> <i>fact</i> that the Crown sought an inference that Mr. Baldree was in possession of the cocaine and marijuana found in the apartment.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[119]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem with the Crown’s argument is that it says little about the reliability of the assertion that Mr. Baldree is in fact a drug trafficker.&nbsp; The argument is more successful with respect to the fact<i> </i>that the caller <i>intended to purchase drugs</i>.&nbsp; Accordingly, the statement would have been admissible as a statement of present intention if the Crown had sought to introduce it for <i>that</i> purpose<i> </i>(see, e.g., <i>R. v. Ly</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 698).&nbsp; But, as Feldman J.A. observed, that is not why the Crown sought to introduce this evidence (para. 144).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[120]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put another way, the problem with the Crown’s argument is that even if the caller was entirely sincere in his belief that Mr. Baldree was a drug dealer, that does not address <i>why the caller believed what he believed </i>— and whether his belief was in fact true or not<i>.</i>&nbsp; This is not a case of multiple calls, where common sense tells us that the probability of numerous callers all being mistaken is unlikely.&nbsp; Nor do we have sufficient indicia of reliability, either within the statement or in the form of confirmatory evidence outside the statement.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[121]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, and absent more, it thus seems to me a bridge too far to accept the Crown’s argument that this call meets threshold reliability thereby justifying its admission as substantive evidence that Mr. Baldree was engaged in drug trafficking.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Can a Single Call Ever Be Reliable?</i></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[122]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just because the single call here did not meet the threshold test for admissibility, it does not follow that multiple calls are <i>required </i>to establish as much.&nbsp; Indeed, it is perfectly consistent with the principled approach that even a single<i> </i>drug purchase call may meet that threshold.&nbsp; I will attempt to explain why using the facts of this call as an example.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[123]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I mentioned earlier, what is missing in this call is some assurance that Mr. Baldree was <i>in fact </i>a drug dealer.&nbsp; There are insufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness within the call itself and little or no external confirmatory evidence.&nbsp; However, if the caller had declined the offer of delivery and instead asked “if I can drop by Eric’s apartment to pick up the drugs”, that may have been sufficient because it would have indicated greater familiarity with Mr. Baldree and his activities, including contemporary knowledge of his recent move to Mr. Lepage’s apartment.&nbsp; A debt list at Mr. Lepage’s apartment with Mr. Baldree’s fingerprints on it may also have done the trick because it would have served as confirmatory evidence of Mr. Baldree’s involvement in drug trafficking.&nbsp; One can imagine other scenarios.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[124]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My point is simply that had the circumstances been somewhat different, there may well have been a satisfactory basis for evaluating whether the caller <i>believed </i>Mr. Baldree was a drug dealer <i>and</i> whether that belief was <i>in fact </i>true.&nbsp; That is what threshold reliability requires.&nbsp; Setting aside the facts of this case, we do not know what the circumstances of some future call might be.&nbsp; I would thus caution against the notion that only multiple calls can be reliable.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt">III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Conclusion</u></p>
