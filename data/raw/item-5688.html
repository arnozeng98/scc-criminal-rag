   <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law—Failure of Court to proceed with case at appointed time and place—Resulting loss of jurisdiction—Jurisdiction over offence not saved by curative section&nbsp;of Code—Criminal Code, s.440.1 [en. 1974-75-76, c. 93, s.&nbsp;43].</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">On </span><span lang="EN-CA">February 9, 1977</span><span lang="EN-CA">, the respondent was charged with unlawfully driving a motor vehicle while impaired. The case was adjourned from time to time until finally set for trial on April 21, 1977, at </span><span lang="EN-CA">2:00 p.m.</span><span lang="EN-CA"> in Courtroom No. 5 of the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Provincial</span><span lang="EN-CA"> Court </span><span lang="EN-CA">Building</span><span lang="EN-CA"> in the City of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Edmonton</span><span lang="EN-CA">. Due to a mix-up, the case was called that morning in Courtroom No. 1 and, the respondent not being present, the provincial judge issued a warrant for her arrest. Unaware of these developments, the respondent and her counsel duly appeared at Courtroom No. 5 at 2:00 p.m. Her name did not appear on the list of cases scheduled to be heard that afternoon. Crown counsel told respondent’s counsel that he knew nothing about the charge. The respondent and her counsel departed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Thereafter, the respondent applied to the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta for an order (i) setting aside the warrant, and (ii) prohibiting the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Provincial Court</span><span lang="EN-CA"> from dealing further with the information. The order was granted. The Crown conceded that the warrant had been improperly issued, but challenged, in the Appellate Division, that part of the order which prohibited further proceedings on the information. The Appellate Division in a unanimous judgment maintained the order of prohibition. Subsequently, leave to appeal to this Court was granted. The narrow question was whether s.&nbsp;440.1 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>a curative section&nbsp;proclaimed in force </span><span lang="EN-CA">April 26, 1976</span><span lang="EN-CA">, remedies a loss of jurisdiction resulting from the failure of a court to proceed with a case at the appointed time and place.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1054]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">: The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The language of s.&nbsp;440.1(1), read in its grammatical and ordinary sense, is simply not wide enough to cover the situation, as here, where there is failure on the part of the court to proceed. The language of s.&nbsp;440.1 (2) is equally inapposite.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 440.1(1), on a plain reading, contemplates three elements, precedent to the operation of the section, namely, (i) a proceeding before a court, judge, magistrate or justice; (ii) failure to comply with the provisions of the <i>Code </i>relating to adjournments or remands; (iii)&nbsp;non-appearance of the accused or defendant at any such proceeding or adjournment thereof. It is doubtful if any one of these elements is present in circumstances where the accused or defendant appears at the time and place appointed, but the court fails to appear and nothing is done.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 440.1 is directed to the situation where there has been a procedural defect or irregularity in respect of adjournments or remands. The court may purport to adjourn the trial or remand the accused, but inadvertently breach some provision of the <i>Criminal Code </i>in so doing. A good example is the case in which the magistrate contravenes the eight-day time limitation by adjourning the matter beyond eight days without consent or <i>sine die. </i>In those circumstances, the proceedings are not to be held to be invalid. Section 440.1, in effect, gives statutory recognition to the earlier practice of issuing a summons or warrant to bring an accused person before the court where there had been an improper adjournment and the accused failed to appear.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The problem in the instant case was not one of contravention of the requisites of the <i>Code </i>relating to adjournments. There was no failure to comply with any provision of the <i>Code. </i>The imbroglio arose because the court failed to appear and nothing was done at the time and place set for trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">In the case of <i>Doyle v. The Queen, </i>[1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, the Court evidenced a willingness to abandon the distinction between loss of jurisdiction over the person (as in improper adjournments) and loss of jurisdiction over the offence (as in a failure to proceed). Section 440.1, however, cannot be interpreted as embracing both eventualities. It is not so worded as to save jurisdiction over the offence when the court has not acted. The decision in <i>Trenholm v</i>. <i>Attorney-General of Ontario, </i>[1940] S.C.R. 301, affirmed in <i>Doyle, </i>governs this appeal.</span></p>

   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">Brian Burrows, for the respondent.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of the Court was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">DICKSON J.—It has long been recognized in our law that an inferior court may suffer loss of jurisdiction by reason of some procedural irregularity, as for example, when the date to which an accused is remanded or to which a case is adjourned for trial comes and goes without any hearing or appearance, “with nothing done”. The narrow question in this appeal is whether s.&nbsp;440.1 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>a curative section&nbsp;proclaimed in force April 26, 1976, remedies a loss of jurisdiction resulting from the failure of a court to proceed with a case at the appointed time and place.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The facts are short and simple. On </span><span lang="EN-CA">February 9, 1977</span><span lang="EN-CA">, the respondent was charged with unlawfully driving a motor vehicle while impaired. The case was adjourned from time to time until finally set for trial on April 21, 1977, at </span><span lang="EN-CA">2.00 p.m.</span><span lang="EN-CA"> in Courtroom No. 5 of the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Provincial</span><span lang="EN-CA"> Court </span><span lang="EN-CA">Building</span><span lang="EN-CA"> in the City of </span><span lang="EN-CA">Edmonton</span><span lang="EN-CA">. Due to a mix-up, the case was called that morning in Courtroom No. 1 and, the respondent not being present, the provincial judge issued a warrant for her arrest. Unaware of these developments, the respondent and her counsel duly appeared at Courtroom No. 5 at 2.00 p.m. Her name did not appear on the list of cases scheduled to be heard that afternoon. Crown counsel told respondent’s counsel that he knew nothing about the charge. The respondent and her counsel departed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Thereafter, the respondent applied to the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta for an order (i) setting aside the warrant, and (ii) prohib-</span></p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 1056]</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">iting the </span><span lang="EN-CA">Provincial Court</span><span lang="EN-CA"> from dealing further with the information. The order was granted. The Crown conceded that the warrant had been improperly issued, but challenged, in the Appellate Division, that part of the order which prohibited further proceedings on the information. The Appellate Division in a unanimous judgment maintained the order of prohibition.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In circumstances of a failure to act, the leading decision is <i>Trenholm v. Attorney-General of Ontario</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a>, in which the applicant sought a writ of <i>habeas corpus. </i>He had appeared before a magistrate on </span><span lang="EN-CA">January 3, 1938</span><span lang="EN-CA">, and was remanded to January 10, 1938. An inquiry into his mental condition was being conducted in the interim. By warrant dated January 12, he was detained at a mental institution. It was held the warrant was not validly issued because the remand had expired on the tenth, at which time no steps were taken. Thus, there was no authority under which the warrant could have been issued. There was “no criminal cause or charge in existence”: per Kerwin J. at p.&nbsp;308. The justice became <i>functus</i>: per Davis J. at p.&nbsp;313. Loss of jurisdiction over the offence occurred when the date of adjournment or remand passed and “nothing was done”. Such procedural defect destroyed the jurisdiction of the court. The indictment or warrant became invalid and of no effect. <i>R. v. Lights</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[3]</span></span></span></a>; <i>Ex p.&nbsp;Peters</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[4]</span></span></span></a>; <i>R. v. Mack</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[5]</span></span></span></a>.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In a more recent judgment of this Court, <i>Doyle v. The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[6]</span></span></span></a>, <i>Trenholm </i>was affirmed. Where a court fails to proceed with a hearing, jurisdiction over the information charging the accused with the offence is lost, and thereafter “that information is to be treated as if it had never been laid”: per Ritchie J. at p.&nbsp;610.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The question for determination in the case at bar, however, is whether s.&nbsp;440.1 of the <i>Code </i>has changed all of this. Does the section&nbsp;have the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1057]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">result of saving the jurisdiction which would otherwise have been lost? Section 440.1 reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(1) The validity of any proceeding before a court, judge, magistrate or justice is not affected by any failure to comply with the provisions of this Act relating to adjournments or remands, and where such failure has occurred and an accused or a defendant does not appear at any such proceeding or upon any adjournment thereof, the court, judge, magistrate or justice may issue a summons or, if it or he considers it necessary in the public interest, a warrant for the arrest of the accused or defendant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) Where, in the opinion of the court, judge, magistrate or justice, an accused or a defendant who appears at a proceeding has been misled or prejudiced by reason of any matter referred to in subsection&nbsp;(1), the court, judge, magistrate or justice may adjourn the proceeding and may make such order as it or he considers proper.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(3) The provisions of Part XIV apply <i>mutatis mutandis </i>where a summons or warrant is issued under subsection&nbsp;(1).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown contends that where an adjournment expires with no valid action taken by the court, s.&nbsp;440.1(1) preserves the court’s jurisdiction on the information charging the accused. Reliance is place upon <i>Doyle v. The Queen, supra.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Prior to the decision in <i>Doyle, </i>there was a respectable body of authority which drew a distinction between loss of jurisdiction over the person and loss of jurisdiction over the offence, <i>i.e. </i>the indictment or information. Loss of jurisdiction over the person was considered to arise when the court failed to follow the prescriptions of the <i>Criminal Code </i>pertaining to adjournments and remands. Although jurisdiction over the person was said to be lost, it could be regained when the accused appeared before the court voluntarily or in response to a summons or warrant. Proceedings then continued on the original information or indictment. See <i>R. v. Bence et al, Ex p.&nbsp;Regina Oral Arts Ltd.</i><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

Very briefly, these were the circumstances in <i>Doyle. </i>There had been a number of delays and adjournments, each of which had been met by protest from counsel representing Doyle. Although the information had been initiated December 8, 1973, it was not until April 1, 1974, that the charge was read to the accused. At that time, the Court further adjourned the trial to a time four months later. Doyle then brought an application for a writ of <i>mandamus </i>declaring void his recognizance. Mr.&nbsp;Justice Ritchie, writing for this Court, held that the failure to put the accused to his election “involved the loss of jurisdiction over the accused” (p. 607); and, by adjourning the case for more than eight days, “jurisdiction over the person of the accused was accordingly lost” (p. 608). Later in the judgment, in <i>obiter dicta, </i>Mr.&nbsp;Justice Ritchie, had this to say:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">In the present case if the magistrate had granted an adjournment for eight days and then done nothing, the situation would have been exactly within the <i>Trenholm </i>decision and I cannot see that the affirmative violation of the <i>Code </i>by adjournment for more than eight days which occurred here affords any distinction in principle from the acquiescence in allowing an eight-day adjournment to expire which is what occurred in <i>Trenholm. </i>(p.&nbsp;609)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is this language which has been interpreted as removing the distinction between loss of jurisdiction over the information or indictment and loss of jurisdiction over the person. See the annotation “The Wonderful World of Practice”, 35 C.R.N.S. 14 at p.&nbsp;19; also “Criminal Law and Procedure”, (1977) 9 Ott.L.R. 568 at p.&nbsp;648.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It should be observed at the outset that this case approximates the situation in <i>Trenholm, </i>where “nothing is done”, rather than in <i>Doyle, </i>where there was a clear contravention of a specific provision of the <i>Code </i>relating to adjournments. <i>Doyle</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1059]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">did nothing to erode the view expressed in <i>Trenholm </i>that when the assigned date passes, without action taken, jurisdiction is lost. <i>Doyle </i>had the effect of recognizing a like loss of jurisdiction when there has been an irregular adjournment or remand. If the <i>dicta </i>in <i>Doyle </i>could be said to have suppressed the distinction between jurisdiction over the person and jurisdiction over the offence, s.&nbsp;440.1 may be seen as restoring that distinction, in the sense that it permits the court, judge, magistrate or justice to issue a summons or warrant to secure attendance of an accused or defendant where there is any failure to comply with the provisions of the <i>Code </i>relating to adjournments or remands. The validity of the proceeding is not affected by such failure.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown advances two main arguments. First, it is said that in setting an adjournment to a certain time and place, and allowing it to expire without the court taking steps to extend the adjournment or otherwise deal with the matter, there has been a failure to comply with the provisions relating to adjournments. When the court does nothing on the ‘adjourned’ date, it has failed to comply with the terms of the adjournment and is therefore within the curative scope of s.&nbsp;440.1.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Second, it is argued that the section&nbsp;ought to be given a liberal construction; taking a fair and liberal reading, failure to deal with a matter on the adjourned date is a failure relating to an adjournment. The spirit in which s.&nbsp;440.1 was enacted was that of resolving procedural irregularities and losses of jurisdiction. If <i>Doyle </i>teaches that there is no difference in principle between the two sets of circumstances in which formerly there would have been a loss of jurisdiction, then s.&nbsp;440.1 ought to be applied equally to cover losses of jurisdiction over the person and the offence. More particularly, it is urged that the section&nbsp;can be used to remedy a failure by the court to attend proceedings set for a particular day.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown submits that a narrow reading of s.&nbsp;440.1 will revive the dichotomy of loss of jurisdiction and that the section&nbsp;should receive such large</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1060]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">interpretation as will save jurisdiction in a case such as the one at bar. It might be noted that a broad interpretation was given in <i>Magna v. R.</i><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[13]</span></span></span></a>; in <i>R. v</i>. <i>Griffin, Whyte, Porter, and Bruce </i>(Ont. Weekly Court, August 15, 1978, unreported); and in <i>Craven </i>and <i>National Aviation Consultants Ltd. v. R. </i>(Toronto Weekly Court, March 26, 1979, unreported). A narrow interpretation was preferred by the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island sitting <i>in banco </i>in <i>R. v. Barry </i>(October 11, 1978, unreported).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the interpretation the Crown would give to the word “adjournment”, in order to use s.&nbsp;440.1 to cure a loss of jurisdiction consequent upon a failure of the court to attend, is both artificial and contrived. The language of s.&nbsp;440.1(1), read in its grammatical and ordinary sense, is simply not wide enough to cover the situation, as here, where there is failure on the part of the court to proceed. The language of s.&nbsp;440.1(2) is equally inapposite.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 440.1(1), on a plain reading, contemplates three elements, precedent to the operation of the section, namely, (i) a proceeding before a court, judge, magistrate or justice; (ii) failure to comply with the provisions of the <i>Code </i>relating to adjournments or remands; (iii)&nbsp;non‑appearance of the accused or defendant at any such proceeding or adjournment thereof. In my view, it is doubtful if any one of these elements is present in circumstances where the accused or defendant appears at the time and place appointed, but the court fails to appear and nothing is done.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 440.1 is directed to the situation where there has been a procedural defect or irregularity in respect of adjournments or remands. The court may purport to adjourn the trial or remand the accused, but inadvertently breach some provision of the <i>Criminal Code </i>in so doing. A good example is the case in which the magistrate contravenes the eight-day time limitation by adjourning the matter beyond eight days without consent (<i>R. v</i>. <i>Dupras Ltd.; R. v. Latraverse</i><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[14]</span></span></span></a>)<i> </i>or <i>sine die (Queen v.</i></span></p>

Arial">[17]</span></span></span></a>). </span><span lang="EN-CA">In those circumstances, the proceedings are not to be held to be invalid. Section 440.1, in effect, gives statutory recognition to the earlier practice of issuing a summons or warrant to bring an accused person before the court where there had been an improper adjournment and the accused failed to appear.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The problem in the instant case was not one of contravention of the requisities of the <i>Code </i>relating to adjournments. There was no failure to comply with any provision of the <i>Code. </i>The imbroglio arose because the court failed to appear and nothing was done at the time and place set for trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the case of <i>Doyle, </i>the Court evidenced, as I have indicated, a willingness to abandon the distinction between loss of jurisdiction over the person (as in improper adjournments) and loss of jurisdiction over the offence (as in a failure to proceed). Section 440.1, however, cannot be interpreted as embracing both eventualities. It is not so worded as to save jurisdiction over the offence when the court has not acted. The <i>Trenholm </i>decision, affirmed in <i>Doyle, </i>governs this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I add this <i>caveat. </i>The Appellate Division was of opinion that the Court had lost jurisdiction over the offence, but that a new information was available, if one could be laid within the limitation period for summary conviction cases. The question of whether a new information may be laid after jurisdiction has been lost is not before us, and I refrain from any extended discussion on the point, in the absence of argument and on the narrow facts of this case. It is manifest, however, that there will be occasions on which the laying of a new information will not be available. Time limitations may preclude it. Indeed, the laying of another information may amount to nothing less than an abuse of process. The successful challenge</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 1062]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">to jurisdiction may not come until after trial on the merits and conviction. The full effect of s.&nbsp;440.1(2) and possible prejudice to the accused, through the laying of a new information, would require consideration. The <i>dicta </i>in <i>Doyle </i>should not therefore, in my opinion, be taken as authority for the proposition that in every case it will be possible, when jurisdiction over the offence is lost, to lay another information in the same jurisdiction charging the same offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I would dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to the order granting leave to appeal to this Court, the appellant will pay the costs of the respondent on a solicitor and client basis.</span></p>
