 <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law — Wiretaps — Authorization — Entry without consent to plant bug — Whether or not authorization implied power to plant device through illegal means — Whether or not illegal means for planting device can be sanctioned by term of judge's authorization — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.

 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">A judge of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench gave an authorization to intercept private communications but refused to grant an order authorizing entry upon private premises to install and to remove the microphone. The Alberta Government, as a result of this judgment, referred two questions to the Alberta Court of Appeal raising the issues of (1) whether, in Part IV.1 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>Parliament intended by necessary implication to empower police officers to enter private property to install listening devices when they act under an authorization to intercept private communications and (2) whether a judge may expressly authorize such entry when he grants an authorization for an interception of private communications. The Alberta Court of Appeal answered both questions in the negative.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the two questions should be answered in the affirmative.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: An authorization given by a judge under Part IV.1 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>authorizes by necessary implication any person acting under the authorization to enter any place at which private communications are to be intercepted</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 698]</span></p>
 <p class="Summary" style="text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">to install or to service a permitted listening device—provided such entry is required to implement the particular authorization—unless the authorization includes limitations on or prohibitions of such entry. A judge in giving an authorization has jurisdiction to expressly authorize a person acting under the authorization to enter any place at which private communications are to be intercepted to install or service a device, provided such entry is required to implement the particular authorization.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Dickson and Chouinard JJ. <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">dissenting: </span></i>Parliament did not intend that an authorization to intercept private communications should accord, by necessary implication, the person acting under its power to enter any place to install, monitor, repair or remove a listening device. At common law, entry into a person's private premises without either consent or specific legal authorization has always been unlawful. Unless authorized by law, a police officer has no more right than an ordinary citizen to interfere with a person's property. The Court has recently reaffirmed the longstanding protection the common law accords to rights of property in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Colet </span><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">v. The Queen, </span></i>[1981] 1 S.C.R. 2, where it unanimously held that a statutory power to seize firearms did not carry with it, by necessary implication, a power to enter and search. This decision is a particular application of a larger canon of statutory interpretation: in general, it will be presumed in the absence of express statutory language that a legislative body did not intend to authorize an act unlawful at common law.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">While Parliament clearly intended oral communications should be the subject of interception, there was nothing to indicate that such communications could not be effectively intercepted without an implied power of entry. The fact that oral communications could be intercepted more frequently and more conveniently if a power of entry was inferred does not justify the implication of such a power. The omission of this power by Parliament from the otherwise detailed statutory scheme of Part IV.1 is strong indication that it did not consider such a power either essential or necessary to give effect to an authorization to intercept oral communications.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The committee reports which were before Parliament at the time of the introduction of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">Protection of </span></i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 699]</span></p>
 <p class="Summary" style="text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">do not provide any substantial support for the view that Parliament intended by necessary implication to authorize entry in aid of interception.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Subsection 25(1) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>cannot support a right of entry by the police to effect an authorization to intercept oral communications; this subjection does not augment the powers of the police beyond those accorded them by the <i>Criminal Code </i>or at common law.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">At common law, the police have never been entitled to</span><span lang="EN-CA"> exercise a general right of entry as part of their powers. Unless specifically authorized by law, a police officer has no right to enter upon the private property of another without consent. The situations where entry has been authorized at common law are exceptional and few in number. R. v. <i>Waterfield, </i>[1963] <i>3 </i>All E.R. <i>659 (C.A.), </i>does not stand for the proposition that a power of entry to private property for the purpose of installing a listening device can arise simply by virtue of a policeman's general duty to detect crime and enforce the law. Furthermore, <i>Waterfield </i>provides no assistance where the conduct of the police is of itself unlawful and has been initiated with full knowledge of its potential illegality.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Subsection <i>26(2) </i>of the <i>Interpretation Act, R.S.C. </i>1970, <i>c. </i>I-23, <i>is </i>a general deeming provision which cannot supply authority for conduct that is otherwise unlawful and, in any event, the conditions for its operation are not fulfilled.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Since Parliament has neither explicitly nor implicitly granted a person acting under an authorization to intercept private communications a right of entry, there can be no power in a judge to expressly grant such power as a term of an authorization pursuant to s. 178.13(2). A judge acting under a statutory scheme is limited by the authority accorded under the statute.</span></p>
 <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The two questions posed in this reference should be answered in the negative.</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">These questions raise the substantial issue of the limits Parliament intended to impose upon the interception of private communications by the police in aid of criminal law enforcement. Equally important, this reference compels the Court to inquire into societal interests in conversational privacy protected by the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Criminal Code </span></i>as well as the breadth of every citizen's common law right to the exclusive and unimpaired enjoyment of property.</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">A review of this legislation reveals that Parliament has struck a balance between the privacy interest of the individual and the competing interest of the public in law enforcement: </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:1.1pt">R.</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> v.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The main features of the regulatory scheme Parliament chose to accomplish these competing objectives are readily apparent. First, a group of indictable offences has been created prohibiting: (a) the interception of private communications by anyone by means of any form of listening device (s. 178.11(1)); (b) the purchase, sale or possession of a listening device (s. 178.18(1)); (c) the disclosure of any private communication intercepted by the use of any such device (s. 178.2). Additionally, a court may order punitive damages up to $5,000 be paid to any person aggrieved by the unauthorized interception of private communication or the improper disclosure of them. Secondly, Parliament has created, as exceptions to these prohibitions, procedures subject to judicial control for the lawful interception of private communications in limited circumstances (ss. 178.11(2), 178.12, 178.13). Finally, Parliament has established rules regarding the admissibility of evidence obtained by the interception of private communications (s. 178.16).</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">&nbsp;in this reference, I intend to consider only the questions of statutory interpretation raised.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">IV <u>The Existence of Implied Authority</u> </span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(A) <u>The Nature of the Issue</u></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">It is the submission of the Attorney General and his supporting interveners (hereinafter "the appellants") that the power to enter to install a listening device is accorded by necessary implication to any person acting under an authorization granted pursuant to Part IV.1 of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Criminal Code. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Nothing in Part IV.1 expressly provides that when an authorization to intercept private communications is made, the power to enter in aid of the interception is included. The Attorney General of Alberta has been compelled to ask, therefore, whether the statute produces that result by implication and to argue accordingly.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The neutral language used by the Lieutenant Governor in Council belies the real significance of the first question and the far-reaching consequences of an affirmative answer to it. Put plainly, the argument is that Parliament intended, although it did not expressly so specify, to sanction otherwise unlawful conduct on the part of the police by permitting them to trespass to intercept private communications.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The police are entitled to take any lawful action in aid of law enforcement. Thus the power of the police to enter to install a listening device when to do so would involve no violation of the law cannot be disputed, so long as this does not conflict with any of the terms imposed in the authorization. There is no need for Parliament to approve either expressly or by implication an otherwise lawful entry undertaken by the police and I do not understand the first question to place this in issue. It is rather the issue of whether Parliament has authorized an illegal entry that lies at the heart of the question.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The appellants' claim that police officers are permitted to enter private premises to install listening devices is broad and indiscriminate. It is worthwhile to examine briefly the consequences of</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 707]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">accepting that such a sweeping right exists. The power so granted would go much further than authorizing surreptitious entry and would allow the police to act openly and utilize whatever means to achieve entry they found most expedient. Thus, access could be obtained by forcing doors or windows or through trickery or coercion. Further, if police acting under Part IV.1 are implicitly authorized to make entry, s. 25 of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Code </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">would permit them to effect such entry by overcoming force a property owner is normally entitled to assert, to prevent anyone, including the police, from entering the premises without permission. If the right exists, it must exist in respect of premises of persons who, at the time the entry is made, are innocent of any offence as well as those who have more than passing acquaintance with the criminal process.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(B) </span><u><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The Common Law of Trespass and Statutory</span></u><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> <u>Interpretation</u></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Prima facie, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">every invasion of property, be it ever so minute and negligible, is a trespass and therefore unlawful. Such trespass may not amount to crime since "breaking the close" </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">simpliciter is </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">not a criminal offence. Nonetheless, entry into the premises of another without either consent or specific legal authorization has always been tortious and unlawful.

In his opinion, the police were not entitled to invade the private rights of individuals unless they were expressly authorized to do so.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">In rejecting the argument of the Crown that a right of entry and a power of search should be implied, Ritchie J. had this to say, at pp. </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.7pt">8 </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.4pt">and 9:</span></p>
 <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In the final analysis this appeal raises the all important question of whether the property rights of the individual can be invaded otherwise than with specific statutory authority.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The decision in <i>Colet <span style="letter-spacing:

This canon embodies the presumption in favour of vested rights (see Duff C.J. in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Spooner Oils Ltd. v. Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board, </span></i>[1933] S.C.R. 629, at p. 638) as well as the presumption that express language must be found to demonstrate that a legislative body intended to authorize an act otherwise unlawful at common law. On the necessity of express language see also: S.G.G. Edgar, <i>Craies <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">on Statute Law </span></i>(7th ed. 1971), pp. 121-22; E.A.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellants submit that the authority to intercept oral communications, as distinct from telecommunications, is unworkable without the right to enter to install listening devices. Such a power should therefore be implied.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There has been no material presented to this Court to support the suggestion that oral communications cannot be effectively intercepted without the power to trespass to install listening devices. Justice MacDonald in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Re Application for Authorization to Intercept Private Communications, supra, </span></i>at p. 46, refused to "accept as a fact that without trespassory entry almost all electronic bugging would be impossible.... " Mr. Justice Stevenson in the Court of Appeal labelled this assertion, correctly in my respectful opinion, "an appeal to convenience" (at p. 633).</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I also find the argument singularly unpersuasive. Parliament intended oral communications, as well as telecommunications, should be the proper subject of interception. That much is made clear by the disjunctive definition of "private communications" in s. 178.1; in this regard, see <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Goldman v. The Queen, </span></i>[1980] 1 S.C.R. 976.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I am not convinced, however, that the interception of oral communications contemplated by Part IV.1 cannot be accomplished without a trespass. It may well be that, absent covert entry, electronic bugging would be much more difficult, but it is not correct to say that oral communications cannot be intercepted without a power of entry. See <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Lopez v. United States, </span></i>373 U.S. 427 (1963), at pp. 467-68, <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">per </span></i>Brennan J. dissenting.</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 711]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">If the police obtain the cooperation of a person who does have a legal right of access to a place, there is no need to commit a trespass to install a listening device. Unlawful entry can also be avoided when oral communications are intercepted with the aid of a person fitted with a body pack who enters a place with consent or by the use of a long range parabolic microphone. It seems to me that there are many occasions when oral communications can be effectively intercepted without a power of entry.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The strongest indication that Parliament considered a power of entry was not essential to give effect to an authorization to intercept oral communications is the omission of this power from the extremely detailed provisions of Part IV.1. The fact that they could perhaps be intercepted more frequently and more conveniently if there were such a power constitutes, in my view, scant justification for inferring such a power.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(2) <u>Legislative Background</u></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The appellants invited the Court to look at the material which led up to the introduction of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Protection of Privacy Act </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">in order to determine the intention and objectives present to the minds of the legislators. Particular reference was made to the report of the Canadian Committee on Correction (the Ouimet Committee — 1969) as well as the minutes of the Standing Committee of the House of Commons on Justice and Legal Affairs. In their view, these materials made clear that Parliament was well aware of the fact that surreptitious entry into private premises for the purpose of concealing electronic listening devices was an integral part of electronic surveillance.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Several recent judgments of this Court discuss the admissibility of extrinsic materials where issues of statutory interpretation are raised: </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[1981] </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">1 S.C.R. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">714, at pp. 721-24; </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Law Society of Upper Canada </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">v. </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Skapinker, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[19841 1 S.C.R. 357; </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Re: Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[1984] 1 S.C.R. 297.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">&nbsp;evidence is <u>not</u> receivable as an aid to the construction of a statute. This is of course true whether or not the case raises a constitutional issue. No direct assistance can be derived, therefore, from the materials relied upon by the appellant in deciding whether Parliament intended by necessary implication to authorize entry.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">In any event, I find the committees' reports inconclusive. Nowhere can I find any substantial support for the view that the proponents of the legislation intended implicitly to endorse trespass in aid of authorized interceptions.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">I conclude therefore that the legislative background cannot be used as an aid to the construction of Part IV.1 and that, in any event, it does not support the appellants' position.</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Considerable reliance was placed upon </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Dalia v. United States, 441 </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">U.S. 238 (1979), by the parties. </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Part IV.1 of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Criminal Code </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">resembles </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Title </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.1pt">III </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

Like Part IV.1, Title III does not expressly authorize covert entry to effect authorized interceptions. The majority of the Supreme Court of the United States, </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Powell J. (Burger C.J., White, Blackmun and Rehnquist JJ. concurring), held that a power of entry was implicitly included. Justices Stevens, Brennan and Marshall dissented, finding a covert entry to install a bug to be unlawful under the statute. Justice Stewart, the ninth member of the Court, disposed of the matter on constitutional grounds and therefore did not reach the question of statutory construction.</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 713]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Justice Powell, for the majority, gave three reasons for his holding. His first argument was that Congress had enacted a detailed scheme to authorize interception of private communications, and there was nothing to suggest that authority was </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">limited to cases in which covert entry would not be</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> required. The same could be said about Part IV.1 of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Criminal Code. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">I <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">agree, however, with the dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens that this argument actually works the other way. Where a legislative scheme speaks in considerable detail about most aspects of an issue, but is silent on one </span><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">aspect, that silence is particularly telling. To imply</span><span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">permission from silence, in the words of Stevens J.</span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> at p. 263, "converts silence into thunder". Parliament's silence cannot be taken to sanction what amounts to breaking and entering. The careful attempt in Part IV.1 of the </span><i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Code </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">to circumscribe invasions of privacy cannot be seen as an indication of a parliamentary intent to legalize break-ins.</span></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Justice Powell's second argument was that the legislative history of Title III confirmed that Congress meant to authorize covert entries. The dissenting judges drew exactly the opposite conclusion. I have already indicated why I do not consider the legislative context in which Part IV.1 was enacted useful to the resolution of this case.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Justice Powell argued finally that a limitation having the effect of prohibiting covert entry would thwart congressional intention because most bugging requires covert entries. The difficulty with this argument is that it assumes what it is trying to prove. If legislative intention is to enable interception of oral communications by whatever means, prohibition of covert entry indeed thwarts legislative intention. I am unwilling, however, to make the assumption this argument requires. I have </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">already expressed my reasons for concluding that a</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> right of entry is not necessary for the effective operation of Part IV.1.</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 714]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I agree with the point made in the dissenting opinion of Justice Brennan in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Dalia </span></i>that where private communications have been recorded subsequent to a trespass to install a listening device two invasions of privacy have taken place. The listening to the conversation breaches conversational privacy; the illegal entry breaches physical privacy. A breach of conversational privacy, by itself, is clearly approved of by Part IV.1, provided an authorization has been obtained; a breach of physical privacy is not. I am not prepared to infer that Parliament, by authorizing invasion of privacy in one form, has thereby authorized invasion of privacy in another form.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I would note that scholarly comment on <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Dalia </span></i>has been less than panegyrical: Reddick and Westin, <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Covert Police Break-Ins Create Conflict Among U.S. Circuit Courts, </span></i>30 Mercer L.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">I maintain this view. Subsection 25(1) does not augment the powers of the police beyond those otherwise given to them by the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">It was argued that the common law recognizes certain powers inherent in the execution of a police officer's duty. These powers, it is urged, would permit the police to engage in acts necessary to the fulfillment of their duty even though they involve an otherwise unlawful interference with a person's liberty or property, Reliance was placed upon </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Eccles v.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">If a general power of entry existed at common law, it would still be necessary to examine whether such a power could operate in the face of Parliament's failure to include it expressly in the statutory scheme created to regulate the interception of private communications.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">I would emphasize that the police have never been entitled to exercise a general right of entry as part of the powers accorded them at common law. No authority cited to this Court expressly recognizes such a right. The tenor of the cases the appellants did raise in argument runs counter to the position advanced. Unless specifically authorized by law, a police officer has no right to enter upon the private property of another without consent.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The situations where entry has been authorized are exceptional and few in number.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;Police Force for trespass alleged to have been committed when they entered the appellant's apartment to apprehend a fugitive for whom outstanding arrest warrants existed. The claim was denied by this Court on the basis that the police were entitled, in limited circumstances, to enter private property without consent to effect an arrest. I made the following statement at p. 744:</span></p>
 <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">I would wish to make it clear, however, that there is</span><span lang="EN-CA"> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">no question of an unrestricted right to enter in search of</span> a fugitive. Entry can be made against the will of a householder only if (a) there are reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises and (b) proper announcement is made prior to entry.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The appellants, however, rely upon the following emphasized lines from my reasons in the same case at p. 743:</span></p>
 <p class="Indent2"><u><span lang="EN-CA">But there are occasions when the interest of a private <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">individual in the security of his house must yield to the </span></span></u><u><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">public </span></u><u><span lang="EN-CA">interest, when the public at large has an interest in the process to be executed.</span></u><span lang="EN-CA"> The criminal is not <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">immune from arrest in his own home nor in the home of</span> one of his friends.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As Ritchie J. recognized in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Colet, </span></i>it is quite clear when these lines are read in context that they do not create a general right of entry on the part of the police whenever it can be said that the public at large has an interest in the process to be executed. The creation of so sweeping an exception would quickly swallow up the general protection accorded a property owner at common law from arbitrary invasion. <i><span style="letter-spacing:

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Waterfield, Stenning </span></i>and <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Knowlton </span></i>cases all involved charges of assaulting or obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty.

 <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In the judgment of this court it would be difficult, and</span><span lang="EN-CA"> in the present case it is unnecessary, to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the duties of <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">police constables have been expressed. In most cases it is</span> probably more convenient to consider what the police constable was actually doing and in particular whether such conduct was prima facie an unlawful interference with a person's liberty or property. If so, it is then relevant to consider whether <u>(a) such conduct falls</u> <u><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">within the general scope of any duty imposed by statute</span></u><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span><u>or recognised at common</u> <u>law and (b) whether such</u> <u>conduct, albeit within the general scope of such a duty,</u> <u>involved an unjustifiable use of powers associated with</u> <u>the duty.</u> Thus, while it is no doubt right to say in general terms that police constables have a duty to prevent crime and a duty, when crime is committed, to bring the offender to justice, it is also clear from the decided cases that when the execution of these general duties involves interference with the person or property of a private person, <u>the powers of constables are not unlimited.</u> [My emphasis.]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">R. v.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The appellants argue that a police officer is given the power under Part IV.1 to do a certain thing (i.e. intercept oral communications), thus he is deemed by s. 26(2) to have the power necessary to do that thing (i.e. to enter surreptitiously to install a listening device).

The case against the accused depended upon evidence of electronically intercepted private communications. The trial judge admitted evidence of private communications intercepted on business premises and refused to admit evidence of private communications intercepted in two automobiles and certain other derivative evidence. The accused were acquitted and the Crown appealed. The issue on the appeal was the admissibility of the electronically intercepted evidence under s. <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">178.16(1) </span>of Part IV.1.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Brooke J.A.

The Court of Appeal next considered the trial judge's decision to admit the private communications intercepted in an office and boardroom located on business premises of the accused. The listening devices were installed following surreptitious entry to these premises on two occasions. The enabling authorization under which the police officers acted specifically provided that in intercepting private communications, the police officers were authorized "for such purpose to enter such places as may be necessary in order to install, monitor or remove" any listening devices.</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In the opinion of Brooke J.A., the trial judge quite properly held the evidence admissible under s. 178.16(1) on the basis of the decisions of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Doss, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97, and the British Columbia Court of Appeal in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">R. v.

In his opinion, almost all instances</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> of wiretapping and electronic surveillance involved conduct in the nature of trespass and this includes surreptitious or covert entry.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">With respect, I cannot agree.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">I am fortified in my conclusion that the authority to trespass in order to install a listening device is not to be found either expressly or by implication in Part IV.1. Section 178.16, which makes evidence of intercepted conversations </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">prima facie </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">inadmissible, is a logical corollary to s. 178.11(1), which makes it an offence to wilfully intercept a private communication.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">the number of persons to whom s. 178.11(1) does not apply, including a person who intercepts a private communication "in accordance with" an authorization. The important point is that outside of the specifically enumerated exceptions, everyone who willfully [sic] intercepts a private conversation by means of a device is guilty of an indictable offence. Parliament has taken great pains in Part IV.1 to lay down an elaborate code legitimizing conduct otherwise criminal by the terms of s. 178.11(1).</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As McIntyre J. recognized, in analyzing the purpose of Part IV.1 in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Goldman v.

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">(F) <u>Conclusion on Question # 1</u></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the decision in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Colet </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.5pt">v. The Queen, </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">and the classic principle of statutory interpretation it embodies, are in the end dispositive of this case. The Court held in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:
150%">Colet, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">at p. 10, that "... any provision authorizing police officers to search and enter private property must be phrased in express terms". That reasoning seems to me to apply whether the right of the police to enter private property is sought for the purpose of intercepting private communications or seizing dangerous firearms. I am not at all persuaded that </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Colet </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">can be distinguished. The right of entry is claimed here for the same purpose as it was in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Colet: </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">to aid in the enforcement of the criminal law. Equally, the same justification for inferring the right is advanced: the proper and effective fulfillment of a judicially granted warrant. Ultimately, the logic upon which </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Colet </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">turns is the traditional legal protection accorded private property and the long-standing refusal of the judiciary to impair that protection where Parliament has not itself done so expressly.</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">It follows I would answer the first question posed in the reference in the negative.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">V <u>The Power of</u> <u>a Judge to Expressly Authorize</u> <u>Entry</u></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The second question posed is whether a judge may expressly grant a power to enter as a term of an authorization to intercept oral communications. Paragraph 178.13(2)(d) of Part IV.1 is relied upon in support of the argument that a judge possesses such power. I set it out here again for convenience.</span></p>
 <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">178.13</span></p>
 <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) An authorization shall</span></p>
 <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(d) contain such terms and conditions as the judge</span><span lang="EN-CA"> considers advisable in the public interest; and</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The appellants argue that a judge may grant a right of entry when the interception of oral communications is authorized, whether or not Parliament intended by necessary implication that such a power should exist. The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that s.178.13(2)(d) could only be construed as words of limitation and could not therefore be read as authorizing a court to permit a trespass. Chief Justice McGillivray and Justice Harradence dissented on this point. Each gave separate reasons for his conclusion that a judge could grant the power to trespass as one of the terms of an authorization.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Chief Justice McGillivray held that a judge who grants an authorization has the power to order that the electronic device may be placed by surreptitious entry or by trick where the circumstances require such action. He distinguished this Court's decision in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Colet, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">noting in particular that the success of the police operation depends upon a listening device being planted without the knowledge of the occupier, thus eliminating the element of invasion and the possibility of confrontation that, in his opinion, concerned the Court in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Colet.</span></i></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Furthermore, he considered Parliament well aware that surreptitious entry into private prem</span><span lang="EN-CA">ises</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;for the purpose of concealing electronic devices was often an integral part of electronic eavesdropping. Therefore, when it allowed the practice of bugging to continue it implicitly intended to allow surreptitious entry to continue to the extent authorized by the court. Entry to install a listening device was similar to a policeman standing in a property owner's flower bed listening at an open window. The serious invasion the legislation contemplates is not the entry upon a person's property, but the entry into his mind by intercepting private communication. Once such an invasion is authorized, the means of accomplishing this invasion are merely incidental. Thus, he concluded that an authorization does not carry with it the implicit right of entry; however, a judge may spell out, in describing the manner of interception, any right to enter or re-enter where the police request such power and the judge deems it appropriate.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Harradence J.A. considered that a judge could resort to the common law to permit a peace officer to gain entry to install a listening device. He frankly noted that this step was an expansion of the traditionally limited exceptions to a property owner's rights. Such a judge-made adaptation of police power was justified, in his view, by the serious challenge to our social order posed by modern day criminal activity. He concluded, at p. 628:</span></p>
 <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am of opinion that if a superior court judge, on an application for an authorization made pursuant to Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code, determines that the public weal can </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">only </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">be served by the interception of private <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">communications and that effective interception of those</span> communications can </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.5pt">only </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">be obtained by placing a device on private property, then it is his duty to adapt <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">the common law to meet modern conditions by authoriz</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">ing a surreptitious entry or a suitable strategem to effect</span> the installation of a device on that property.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The power of a judge to grant a power to enter as a term of an authorization has been considered in other cases as well. In </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.5pt">R. v. Dass, supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">at p. 117, Huband J.A., in language <i><span style="letter-spacing:

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">&nbsp;chosen, dealt with this issue in terms that I would, with respect, adopt:</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As previously noted, the reference to the installation<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> of the authorization order is not a fiat by the courts to </span>violate the laws of the land. I see nothing in the Criminal Code which gives a judge the power to authorize or<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> condone illegal entry. Crown counsel points to s. 178.13(2)(d), which appears to enable the judge to </span>impose terms and conditions which he considers advis<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">able in the public interest. In my view, that provision was not intended as a mechanism to have the courts </span>authorize illegal acts. The public interest is not served<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> by acts which violate the civil or criminal laws of the </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">land. The terms and conditions could not validly include</span><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt"> permission, directly or by implication, to ignore or breach such laws.</span></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">R. v. Lyons, supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Anderson J.A., dissenting in part, applied Huband J.A.'s conclusion in the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Dass </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">case that an authorization does not give any authority to trespass and an authorizing judge has no power to authorize or permit the police to act in such an unlawful manner.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">R. v. Papalia, supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that while a judge may include a right of entry as one of the terms of an authorization, it was not necessary for him to do so; in the opinion of that court, an authorization by necessary implication accords the police a right of entry.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">R. v. Hardy </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">(1984), </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

.1pt">the New Brunswick Court of Appeal considered whether the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence private communications which were intercepted by a room monitoring device surreptitiously placed in the accused's residence. In that ease, the authorization given by the judge expressly permitted the police "where reasonably necessary to enter upon the premises in order to install, monitor, remove, service, maintain any and all electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device that may be required to implement this authorization".</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 726]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Court agreed that the intercepted private communications were inadmissible. The Court was, however, divided upon the power of the authorizing judge to grant a right of entry. Stratton J.A. (Hughes C.J. concurring) applied the reasoning of Stevenson J.A. in this reference and concluded that Part IV.1 does not allow a judge to authorize a trespass onto private property for the purpose of installing a listening device. Angers J.A. expressed his agreement with the dissenting reasons of Chief Justice McGillivray. The wording of the authorization was, however, not sufficiently clear to satisfy him that the judge who granted the order intended to authorize the precise entry which was effected.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">If Part IV.1 does not explicitly or implicitly legalize a trespass to install a listening device, then as a corollary, there can be no power in a judge to authorize such an illegality. A judge could never possess the authority to grant the police powers which Parliament did not intend them to be able to exercise. When acting pursuant to a statutory scheme, a judge is limited by the authority granted him by the statute under which he acts. Parliament has not expressly or by necessary implication, authorized a right of entry. A negative response to the first question in this reference compels a negative response to the second.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Before concluding, I would like to make a brief comment upon Justice Harradence's reasoning that the common law, suitably expanded, could provide the legal support for the judicial sanction of surreptitious entry into private premises. With respect, I have the gravest doubt whether it would ever be appropriate for a judge to look to the common law for the right to authorize action by the police which the legislation itself does not expressly or implicitly permit him to authorize; this is especially true where the statutory scheme is an exhaustive and comprehensive expression of legislative policy, like Part IV.1 of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.4pt">Code. </span></i>Where the judge must not only look outside the statutory scheme for the right to act in the manner he proposes, but must "adapt" the common law to suit his purpose, it seems to me he crosses the</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">boundary which separates the judicial from the legislative function.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">I would answer the second question in the negative.</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">VI <u>Conclusion</u></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The right to be free from unwanted intrusion is important and fundamental. It leaves no room for casual inference of Parliamentary sanction of illegality. When Parliament declines to sanction expressly what would otherwise be unlawful acts, we should not assume that it has impliedly given such acts its </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">imprimatur. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Nor should we conclude that Parliament intended the courts to fill a </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">lacuna legis </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">by writing in something which Parliament left out. I agree with the following observation of Lord Scarman in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Morris v. Beardmore, supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">at p. 763, which seems to me to reach the heart of the present appeal:</span></p>
 <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... it is not the task of judges, exercising their ingenuity<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">in </span><span lang="EN-CA">the field of implication, to go further<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">in </span><span lang="EN-CA">the invasion<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>of fundamental private rights and liberties than Parlia<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">ment has expressly authorised.</span></span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">If the police, in order to carry out effectively their difficult and frequently dangerous tasks, are required to break and enter private dwellings, that right should be sought from Parliament in express terms, as an amendment to Part IV.1. It is for Parliament, not the judiciary, still less the police themselves, to fill any gap in the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal Code.</span></i></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Until such time as Parliament speaks specifically on this matter, I am of the view that an unlawful entry to install a listening device is an unauthorized and unjustified use of police powers. If the authorization to intercept did purport to sanction such an entry, the authorization would be invalid in that respect. Judges simply do not have the power to permit anyone, even police officers, to commit unlawful acts. It is therefore my conclusion that both questions posed in this reference</span></p>
 <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 728]</span></p>
 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">must be answered in the negative. I would answer them accordingly and dismiss this appeal.</span></p>

 <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">ESTEY </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">J.—Because the answer to question 1 may be affected by the content of the particular authorization, it is difficult to answer the question in generality. The manner of interception may be expressed in very specific terms in one order, whereas the court in another order may authorize the use of several or all of the devices enumerated in Part IV.1, leaving open to the investigative agency the choice between these devices, and the choice between wiretapping with or without interference with equipment inside the premises, or radio surveillance by electromagnetic devices, or a combination of these and other devices. A different answer, for example, would be required where the order specifically authorized the use of a battery-powered radio transmitter. With that explanation, and for the reasons I have given in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Lyons v.
