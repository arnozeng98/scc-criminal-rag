The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 361, at p.&nbsp;368.&nbsp; Furthermore, the trial judge did not instruct the jury on the limited use of the rebuttal evidence.&nbsp; In fact, as illustrated by the above passage quoted from the charge to the jury, the trial judge actually invited the jury to consider the reply evidence as similar fact evidence.&nbsp; In light of this instruction a jury might well have accepted this evidence as highly relevant to the identity of the perpetrator of the assault on the complainant.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 481-82).&nbsp; Furthermore, I note that the Crown made no arguments to substantiate a claim that the improper admission of the evidence would not amount to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; The Crown did, however, submit that by allowing surrebuttal evidence any prejudice to the appellant was cured.&nbsp; That submission is properly considered in relation to the application of s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii).</span></p>

Chaulk</i>, <i>supra</i>, it was held that the Crown did not improperly split its case.&nbsp; That is, the evidence was properly admissible in rebuttal.&nbsp; At page 1394, Wilson J. stated:</span></p>

C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, which gave it numerical superiority in standing by potential jurors.&nbsp; The Crown's numerical superiority in standing by potential jurors was subsequently ruled unconstitutional by this Court in <i>R. v. Bain</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91.&nbsp; However, the appellant's trial took place prior to <i>R. v. Bain</i>.&nbsp; In this respect, Doherty J.A. stated at p. 768:</span></p>

Those principles do not yield absolute rules of exclusion or admission, but require that the trial judge exercise a discretion through the application of these principles: <i>R. v. Krause</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 466, 29 C.C.C. (3d) 385; <i>R. v. W. (A.)</i> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 171 at pp. 178‑81, 45 O.A.C. 359 (C.A.).</span></p>

Consequently, the trial judge did not direct his mind to the relevant principles or purport to exercise any discretion. There is therefore no record upon which this court may review the trial judge's decision to admit the evidence. In such circumstances (and absent any suggestion of incompetent representation) the appellant can only succeed if he can demonstrate that a reasonable trial judge, applying the applicable principles, could not have admitted the evidence. In other words, if the case is one in which some judges could properly have admitted the evidence while others could properly have excluded it, the appeal cannot succeed.</span></p>

In this respect, the present case must be distinguished from <i>R. v. Jackson</i> (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 91 (B.C.C.A.), the authority relied on by the appellant. In <i>Jackson</i> the reply evidence was directly relevant to the time period when the assault occurred. Ms. Guerts' evidence became much more relevant after the appellant, as part of a detailed account of his movements, put his whereabouts at 8:30 p.m. in issue.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the "abuse" described by Cory&nbsp;J. in <i>Bain</i> refers to both the misuse of the stand-aside power <u>and the resultant negative consequences on the impartiality of the jury selected as a result of that misuse</u>.&nbsp; Consequently in pre-<i>Bain</i> cases the court must address the Crown's use of its numerical advantage to shape the composition of the jury, <u>and</u> must also decide whether the jury selected by that process is one which would create a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable observer.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Thus, according to Doherty&nbsp;J.A., not only must there be an improper use by the Crown of its stand-by power, but the jury so selected must also, <u>in practice</u>, create a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable and properly informed observer.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1955] S.C.R. 16, which marked a turning point in the jurisprudence of this Court on this issue.&nbsp; He made the following remarks at pp.&nbsp;23-24:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime.... The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility.&nbsp; It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">As I emphasized in <i>R. v. Bain</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Crown is party to the fairness of the trial which it also has an obligation to promote.&nbsp; Even though, practically speaking, the trial judge is the ultimate guardian of the fairness of the trial, this does not authorize the prosecution to neglect this obligation nor to undermine its importance.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Impact;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Bain</i>, <i>supra</i>, representativeness is a characteristic which furthers the perception of impartiality even if not fully ensuring it.&nbsp; While representativeness is not an essential quality of a jury, it is one to be sought after.&nbsp; The surest guarantee of jury impartiality consists in the combination of the representativeness with the requirement of a unanimous verdict.&nbsp; Consequently, an apparent attempt by the prosecution to modify the composition of the jury so as to exclude representativeness, as occurred in this case, in itself undermines the impartiality of a jury. </span></p>

(3d) 756), that its aim was to secure a jury which would be capable of judging the issues in an impartial and unbiased manner.&nbsp; So the suggestion of deliberate Crown abuse of the system is not made out.</span></p>
