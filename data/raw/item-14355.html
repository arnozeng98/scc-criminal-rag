margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a murder victim was reported missing, the police received information that his roommate M had confessed to killing him and initiated an investigation. The investigation had two components:&nbsp; a Mr. Big operation and a wiretap authorization to intercept M’s phone calls. During the Mr. Big operation, M twice admitted to undercover police officers that he shot the victim and burned his body. That information led police to conduct a search of a firepit where they located fragments of bones and teeth later identified as belonging to the victim, and shell casings later determined to have been fired from a gun seized from M’s apartment. M was arrested and charged with first degree murder. At the time of M’s arrest, the Mr. Big operation had been in progress for four months and M had participated in 30 “scenarios” with undercover officers. He had been paid approximately $5,000 for his work, plus expenses. At trial, the Crown conceded that its wiretap authorization did not comply with the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and therefore, violated <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. As a result of this violation, the Crown did not adduce any of M’s calls, but did adduce his two confessions to the undercover police officers during the Mr. Big operation. However, M argued that the wiretap authorization was so intertwined with the Mr. Big operation that the illegality of the authorization necessitated excluding his confessions under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. The trial judge rejected this argument and determined that s. 24(2) was not engaged. The trial judge provided instructions to the jury in relation to the evidence arising from the Mr. Big operation. He also cautioned the jury about the testimony of the Crown’s principal witness and provided a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in relation to his evidence. The jury found M guilty of first degree murder and his appeal from conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.</p>

Whether evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed an accused’s rights depends on the nature of the connection between the infringement and the evidence obtained. While a causal connection is not required, the nature and extent of the connection remains an important factor for the trial judge’s consideration. In this case, M confessed to the undercover officers while the illegal wiretap was in place. Although the trial judge found a temporal connection between M’s confessions and the wiretap, its significance was undermined by a tenuous causal connection. That finding was open to the trial judge and there is no basis for interfering with it.</p>

Hart</i>, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 544, under which framework a Mr. Big confession will be excluded where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value, or where it is the product of an abuse of process. This poses no difficulty, however, as M’s confessions would clearly be admissible under that framework.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The probative value of M’s confessions was high because there was an abundance of evidence that was potentially confirmatory. First, M’s purported confessions to his acquaintances A and L describe the same motive for killing the victim as M’s confessions to the undercover officers. They also made reference to burning the victim’s body. Second, immediately after confessing to one of the undercover officers, M led him to the firepit in which the victim’s remains lay undiscovered. And third, shell casings fired from a gun found in M’s apartment were found in the same firepit. On the other hand, the confessions’ prejudicial effect was limited. The operation did not reveal unsavoury facts about M’s history, nor did M participate in any scenarios that involved violence.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor did the undercover officers engage in any improper conduct that could ground an application for abuse of process. M was not presented with overwhelming inducements. He had prospects for legitimate work that would have paid even more than the undercover officers were offering. Nor did the officers threaten M with violence if he would not confess. The most that can be said is that the officers created an air of intimidation by referring to violent acts committed by members of the organization. M, however, was not coerced into confessing.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the <i>Hart</i> framework was intended to respond to the evidentiary concerns raised by Mr. Big confessions, it does not erase them. Rather, it falls to the trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on how to approach these confessions. The nature and extent of the instructions required will vary from case to case. However, there is some guidance — short of a prescriptive formula — that can be provided. The trial judge should tell the jury that the reliability of the accused’s confession is a question for them. The trial judge should then review with the jury the factors relevant to the confession and the evidence surrounding it. For example, the trial judge should alert the jury to the length of the operation, the number of interactions between the police and the accused, the nature of the relationship between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused. Moreover, the trial judge should discuss the fact that the confession itself may contain markers of reliability (or unreliability). Jurors should be told to consider the level of detail in the confession, whether it led to the discovery of additional evidence, whether it identified any elements of the crime that had not been made public, or whether it accurately described mundane details of the crime the accused would not likely have known had he not committed it.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the bad character evidence, the challenge is a more familiar one. The trial judge must instruct the jury that this sort of evidence has been admitted for the limited purpose of providing context for the confession. The jury should be instructed that it cannot rely on that evidence in determining whether the accused is guilty. Moreover, the trial judge should remind the jury that the simulated criminal activity was fabricated and encouraged by agents of the state.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge instructed the jury adequately and no error has been shown. The trial judge told the jury that it had to “carefully consider whether the themes of violence and the level of inducements may reasonably have compromised the reliability” of M’s confessions. He specifically instructed the jury that it had to “assess the environment, the themes of easy money, violence, the importance of honesty and integrity, any offers of exit points, and any threats or intimidation”. Ultimately, the trial judge left the final assessment of the reliability of M’s confessions to the jury. With respect to the bad character evidence, although the trial judge did not address it specifically, he provided the jury with a standard limiting instruction on the use that could be made of any evidence that bore on M’s character. Undoubtedly, the trial judge could have said more, but this does not mean his instructions were deficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the trial judge conveyed to the jury the reliability concerns with the evidence of A, the Crown’s principal witness. He reminded the jury that the defence position was that A was the killer. He told them that M’s knowledge of the murder could have come from A. He brought up A’s apparent lie to the police and cautioned the jury that it left open the question of whether they could rely on anything he said. And he told the jury that it would be dangerous to accept A’s evidence in the absence of confirmatory evidence. Nothing more was required.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About a month after Mr. Levoir’s disappearance, the police received a call from Jay Love, a friend of the appellant. Mr. Love told the police that the appellant had confessed to killing Mr. Levoir and burning his body. Acting on Mr. Love’s tip, the police began investigating the appellant to determine if he was responsible for Mr. Levoir’s disappearance.&nbsp; The investigation had two components: a Mr. Big operation, and a wiretap authorization to intercept the appellant’s phone calls.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mr. Big operation commenced in January 2004, approximately one year after the police received the call from Mr. Love. An undercover officer, whom I will refer to as Ben,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[1]</span></span></a> was introduced to the appellant at a nightclub in Fort McMurray.&nbsp; The appellant was working at the club as a D.J.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A week after their introduction, Ben asked the appellant to help him repossess a vehicle.&nbsp; The appellant did so and was paid $200.&nbsp; During a conversation with Ben a few days later, the appellant mentioned his missing roommate. He told Ben that Mr. Levoir was a “crack head” and a “drug addict”, and accused him of stealing from his son’s piggy bank.&nbsp; He added that “[a]s far as he was concerned”, Mr. Levoir was “pushing up daisies”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early on in the Mr. Big operation, the appellant began to suspect that Ben was involved in criminal activity.&nbsp; Ben told the appellant that he worked for an organization headed up by a man named Liam who “had his fingers into a lot of things”.&nbsp; Throughout January and February 2004, the appellant did several more “jobs” for the organization.&nbsp; In early February, for example, the appellant was asked to pick up a package from a bus depot in Edmonton.&nbsp; When he returned to his hotel room where Ben was waiting, Ben opened the package and it contained $30,000 in cash.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in February 2004, during a conversation between the appellant and Ben, Ben mentioned that he had once been attacked by two men while working for the organization.&nbsp; Ben told the appellant that Liam had “looked after [the] two guys” in what Ben called the “weekend of reckoning”.&nbsp; Ben then asked the appellant if he had ever “beat[en]” anyone. The appellant replied that there were two occasions, once when he was in a fist fight, and another time that he could not talk about.&nbsp; Ben expressed his hope that the appellant would one day tell him about his “secre[t]”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ben brought up the appellant’s secret again in early March.&nbsp; He suggested that the person the appellant was talking about “[wasn’t] walking anymore”.&nbsp; The appellant nodded his head in agreement and added that “every man has a breaking point”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In mid-March, the appellant drove to Vancouver at Ben’s behest to have a meeting with Liam.&nbsp; The appellant and Liam met at an apartment in the city.&nbsp; Liam brought up the appellant’s missing roommate and attempted to question him about the disappearance.&nbsp; The appellant asked Liam if he could “decline” to speak about the matter.&nbsp; Liam told the appellant that it was his choice, but that refusing to speak meant he would remain on the organization’s “third line”.&nbsp; The only way to advance to the “first line” was by talking about his roommate and revealing his secret.&nbsp; The appellant again refused, explaining that “loose lips sink ships”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the appellant’s meeting with Liam, three weeks went by before Ben and the appellant met again in person.&nbsp; On April 9, 2004, Ben asked the appellant if he wanted to work.&nbsp; The appellant said that he did, and that he would “do what it took”.&nbsp; Ben asked the appellant if he would be willing to sit down with Liam to talk about how his roommate had been killed. The appellant agreed to do so.&nbsp; Ben then asked the appellant why he killed Mr. Levoir, and the appellant responded that his former roommate had been “a liar, a thief, and a piece of shit drug dealer”.&nbsp; The appellant told Ben that he shot Mr. Levoir five times — four times in the chest and once in the back — with a .223 rifle.&nbsp; The appellant also said that there was “nothing left” of Mr. Levoir because he had burned his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant initially offered to show Ben where Mr. Levoir’s body had been burned.&nbsp; However, he quickly backtracked, telling Ben that “everything” he had just said was “bullshit” and that he had been “lying”.&nbsp; Ben replied that he “really hope[d]” the appellant had been telling the truth.&nbsp; In response, the appellant changed his mind and took Ben out to a firepit on his father’s property.&nbsp; The appellant told Ben that he had taken the ashes out of the firepit and that there was “nothing left” of Mr. Levoir.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few days later, the appellant was flown to Edmonton for a second meeting with Liam.&nbsp; That meeting took place on April 15, 2004.&nbsp; At the outset, the appellant described Mr. Levoir as a “crack head” and accused him of stealing from his son’s piggy bank.&nbsp; When Liam asked the appellant how he had killed Mr. Levoir, the appellant replied that he shot him five times with a .223 rifle — four times in the chest and once in the back.&nbsp; He added that there had been a “big fire” at his dad’s place, and that there was “nothing left” of Mr. Levoir.&nbsp;</p>

Mr. Argueta was a friend of the appellant and he too testified that the appellant had confessed to him about killing Mr. Levoir.&nbsp; This confession was said to have occurred at a bar in Edmonton, where the appellant told Mr. Argueta that he had “gotten rid” of Mr. Levoir.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The common law rule of evidence that was set out in <i>Hart </i>was intended to respond to the evidentiary concerns raised by Mr. Big operations.&nbsp; However, while this rule responds to these two evidentiary concerns, it does not erase them.&nbsp; The focus of the rule is to determine whether a Mr. Big confession should be admitted into evidence.&nbsp; It does not decide the ultimate question of whether the confession is reliable, nor does it eliminate the prejudicial character evidence that accompanies its admission.&nbsp; Thus, even in cases where Mr. Big confessions are admitted into evidence, concerns with their reliability and prejudice will persist.&nbsp; It then falls to the trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on how to approach these confessions in light of these concerns.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[45]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant agrees that reliability and prejudice are the two evidentiary concerns that must be addressed in a trial judge’s charge to the jury.&nbsp; With respect to reliability, the appellant submits that a “very strict” caution must be given about “danger” presented by Mr. Big confessions (A.F., at para. 95).&nbsp; The appellant points to the jury charge delivered in <i>R. v. Bonisteel</i>, 2008 BCCA 344, 259 B.C.A.C. 114, and argues that a similar instruction should be given in “most, if not all” cases involving Mr. Big confessions (A.F., at para. 96).&nbsp; In <i>Bonisteel</i>, the trial judge provided a strong caution regarding the reliability concerns raised by Mr. Big confessions.&nbsp; The jury was told that people sometimes “confess to [crimes] they have not committed” (para. 66 (emphasis deleted)).&nbsp; Moreover, the jury was told that “confessions produced by an undercover operation such as this are viewed as inherently unreliable” (<i>ibid.</i>).&nbsp; Without independent confirmation, the trial judge described the Mr. Big confessions as “highly suspect” (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 2).&nbsp; In reviewing the trial judge’s charge, what counts is its substance, not its adherence to or departure from prescriptive formulas (<i>R. v. Luciano</i>,<i> </i>2011 ONCA 89, 273 O.A.C. 273,<i> </i>at para. 69).&nbsp; The order of the charge and the words chosen by the trial judge are within his or her discretion (<i>R. v.

Terrico</i>,<i> </i>2005 BCCA 361, 214 B.C.A.C. 135, at paras. 42-43, and <i>R. v. Fry</i>, 2011 BCCA 381, 311 B.C.A.C. 90, at paras. 82-83 and 87).&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the reliability concerns raised by a Mr. Big confession, the trial judge should tell the jury that the reliability of the accused’s confession is a question for them. The trial judge should then review with the jury the factors relevant to the confessions and the evidence surrounding it.&nbsp; As explained in <i>Hart</i>, the reliability of a Mr. Big confession is affected by the circumstances in which the confession was made and by the details contained in the confession itself.&nbsp; Thus, the trial judge should alert the jury to “the length of the operation, the number of interactions between the police and the accused, the nature of the relationship between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused” — all of which play a role in assessing the confession’s reliability (see <i>Hart</i>, at para. 102).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the trial judge should discuss the fact that the confession itself may contain markers of reliability (or unreliability).&nbsp; Jurors should be told to consider the level of detail in the confession, whether it led to the discovery of additional evidence, whether it identified any elements of the crime that had not been made public, or whether it accurately described mundane details of the crime the accused would not likely have known had he not committed it (see<i> Hart</i>,<i> </i>at para. 105).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not to suggest that trial judges are required to provide a detailed catalogue of every piece of evidence that might bear on the reliability of the confession.&nbsp; The task is simply to alert the jury to the concern about the reliability of the confession, and to highlight the factors relevant to assessing it.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the bad character evidence that accompanies a Mr. Big confession, the challenge is a more familiar one.&nbsp; The trial judge must instruct the jury that this sort of evidence has been admitted for the limited purpose of providing context for the confession.&nbsp; The jury should be instructed that it cannot rely on that evidence in determining whether the accused is guilty.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial judge should remind the jury that the simulated criminal activity — even that which the accused may have eagerly participated in — was fabricated and encouraged by agents of the state.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge addressed the concerns about reliability and prejudice in his charge to the jury.&nbsp; The trial judge told the jury that it had to “carefully consider whether the themes of violence and the level of inducement may reasonably have compromised the reliability” of the appellant’s confessions.&nbsp; He specifically instructed the jury that it had to “assess the environment, the themes of easy money, violence, the importance of honesty and integrity, any offers of exit points, and any threats or intimidation”.&nbsp; Ultimately, the trial judge left the final assessment of the reliability of the appellant’s confessions to the jury:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">Overall, it’s your responsibility to decide whether the statements attributed to Mr. Mack are reliable in whole or in part, bearing in mind Mr. Mack’s testimony that he was given pep talks every day . . . that he felt indebted . . . and very insecure, especially after he heard about the day of reckoning for the ice pick attack.&nbsp; Also that Mr. Mack felt out of his league, and whenever he started a story he felt pushed in a direction that he had done it.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast"><u>When a statement may have arisen partly out of fear and partly from an inducement to easy money, it’s important to assess carefully how reliable it is, if at all.&nbsp; You need to assess that against all of the evidence in order to decide not only what was said, but whether what was said was truthful.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[57]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the bad character evidence that was admitted along with the Mr. Big confessions, although the trial judge did not address it specifically, he provided the jury with a standard limiting instruction on the use that could be made of any evidence that bore on the accused’s character:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">You’ll recall in my opening remarks I alerted you that we would likely hear evidence that does not reflect Mr. Mack in a positive light, including views and conducts which are unfavourable to him. You have now heard some evidence of that type, and <u>I remind you not to rely upon or use that evidence to conclude that Mr. Mack is guilty or even that he is more likely to be guilty of the crime with which he is charged based on that evidence</u>.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">In Canada people are not prosecuted or judged as guilty because they have certain beliefs or values. <u>Evidence about things Mr. Mack may have said or acts he may have committed which you find objectionable, it has been provided to you for the very limited purpose of ensuring that you know the context for the other things that are said or done that relate directly to the offence with which he is charged.</u> Background evidence, which we sometimes refer to as the narrative, is provided to you so you understand more accurately the overall circumstances and can then better assess what and whom to believe.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast">So I also repeat that you’re not to decide this case based on your personal views of what you might consider to be Mr. Mack’s value system or his opinions or even whether he might have committed some other wrongful acts or offences. <u>We are concerned with only one charge: the murder of Robert Levoir.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[58]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When these instructions regarding reliability and bad character evidence are viewed through a functional lens, I am satisfied that they reveal no error.&nbsp; The trial judge plainly addressed the two concerns raised by the appellant’s confessions to undercover officers.&nbsp; He directed the jury to “assess carefully” how reliable the appellant’s confessions were, and pointed specifically to the police deception, the level of inducements, the “themes of easy money”, and the presence of any threats or intimidation.&nbsp; During the trial and in his final instructions, the trial judge directed the jury to disregard the prejudicial character evidence that had been admitted in reaching a verdict.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, more could have been said by the trial judge in his discussion of the reliability of the Mr. Big confession.&nbsp; The trial judge, for example, could have specifically reviewed the payments received by the appellant during the operation, or the encouragements to confess that were provided by Ben and Liam.&nbsp; Equally, however, the trial judge could have detailed the evidence that was capable of supporting the reliability of the appellant’s confessions, including the fact that the appellant had gainful employment available to him at the time the cash inducements were offered to him, that he correctly pointed out the location of Mr. Levoir’s remains during his confession to Ben, and that shell casings fired by a rifle found in the appellant’s apartment were discovered in the firepit.&nbsp; The trial judge did not do so, but this does not mean his charge was deficient.&nbsp; A failure to say all that could have been said does not amount to a legal error:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">. . . I cannot emphasize enough that the right of an accused to a properly instructed jury does not equate with the right to a perfectly instructed jury. An accused is entitled to a jury that understands how the evidence relates to the legal issues. This demands a functional approach to the instructions that were given, not an idealized approach to those instructions that might have been given.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It must also be mentioned that trial counsel was provided a draft of the trial judge’s charge in advance of it being delivered to the jury, and no objection was taken to the trial judge’s handling of the Mr. Big confessions.&nbsp; While it is the trial judge’s job to ensure that the jury is properly instructed, trial counsel are expected to “assist the trial judge and identify what in [his or her] opinion is problematic with the judge’s instructions to the jury” (<i>Daley</i>, at para. 58).&nbsp; A failure to object at trial “may be indicative of the seriousness of the alleged violation” (<i>ibid.</i>).&nbsp; Here, although not determinative, trial counsel’s failure to object supports my conclusion that the instructions on reliability and bad character evidence were adequate in the circumstances.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge’s charge left the jury equipped to deal with the concerns of reliability and prejudice that emerged from the Mr. Big confessions.&nbsp; No error has been shown.&nbsp; Accordingly, I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
 <p class="Title2LevelTitre2Niveau" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:normal">C.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did the Trial Judge Err in his Instructions to the Jury Relating to Mr. Argueta’s Testimony?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[62]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his charge, the trial judge instructed the jury to consider Mr. Argueta’s evidence in light of the defence position that it was Mr. Argueta who killed Mr. Levoir.&nbsp; The trial judge referred to the possibility that the appellant’s knowledge of the murder may have come from Mr. Argueta.&nbsp; In addition, he pointed out to the jury that even on Mr. Argueta’s own account, he had lied to the police under oath when he told them that he and the appellant had not discussed Mr. Levoir’s death on the drive back to Fort McMurray from Edmonton.&nbsp; The trial judge noted that Mr. Argueta had provided “no explanation” for this lie and that he appeared “quite unapologetic” about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He cautioned the jury that Mr. Argueta’s apparent lack of concern for the seriousness of the oath “leaves open the question of whether you may rely on anything he says”.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of these concerns, the trial judge provided a <i>Vetrovec</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[4]</span></span></a> warning in relation to Mr. Argueta’s evidence,<i> </i>instructing the jury that it would be “dangerous” for them to accept his testimony in the absence of other evidence that confirmed his account.&nbsp; The trial judge provided two examples of evidence that might be capable of supporting Mr. Argueta’s evidence.&nbsp; The first was Mr. Argueta’s testimony that the appellant was angry with Mr. Levoir because he suspected Mr. Levoir had stolen from his son’s piggy bank and had “run up telephone bills at [the appellant’s] place”.&nbsp; The second was that the appellant “separately testified to what he knew about the price on [Mr.] Levoir’s head”, which was “similar to what Mr. Argueta said on that matter, but was not attributed as having come to [the appellant] from Mr. Argueta”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[64]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that these instructions were deficient.&nbsp; In particular, he submits that the trial judge’s instructions on the importance of Mr. Argueta’s admitted lie to the police under oath was confusing, because the appellant’s position at trial was that Mr. Argueta’s<i> </i>statement to police was truthful and his testimony was a lie.&nbsp; Moreover, the appellant contends that the <i>Vetrovec </i>caution and the related instruction to seek out confirmatory evidence before relying on Mr. Argueta’s evidence was misplaced, because if Mr. Argueta provided information about the murder that turned out to be true, this did not bolster the Crown’s theory that the appellant was guilty of murder. Rather, it supported the defence position that Mr. Argueta, and not the appellant, had killed Mr. Levoir.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to the appellant’s submissions.&nbsp; In my view, the trial judge’s warning about Mr. Argueta’s admitted lie to the police was not confusing.&nbsp; The appellant’s submission to the contrary flows from a technical reading of the instruction.&nbsp; Read fairly and in context, the impugned instruction conveyed to the jury that, even on Mr. Argueta’s own account, he had lied under oath without explanation.&nbsp; Thus, it was questionable whether the jury could rely on anything he said.&nbsp; When this instruction is read in conjunction with the trial judge’s warning that it would be dangerous to rely on Mr. Argueta’s evidence in the absence of confirmatory evidence, it cannot be understood as having endorsed Mr. Argueta’s testimony over the previous version of events he gave to the police.&nbsp; The trial judge was merely conveying to the jury that Mr. Argueta’s evidence was highly suspect and that it would be dangerous to use it to convict in the absence of confirmatory evidence.&nbsp; Had he not given such an instruction, his failure to do so would most assuredly have formed a ground of appeal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[66]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, I cannot accept the contention that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury to search for confirmatory evidence before relying on Mr. Argueta’s testimony.&nbsp; Admittedly, the trial judge provided an example of evidence that was not capable of confirming Mr. Argueta’s evidence.&nbsp; The appellant did not separately testify that he knew about the price on Mr. Levoir’s head, as stated by the trial judge in his charge.&nbsp; Rather, he testified that he heard about the price on Mr. Levoir’s head from Mr. Argueta.&nbsp; It is possible the trial judge simply misspoke, and meant to refer to the fact that both Mr. Argueta and the appellant testified that they knew the deceased was involved in the drug trade in British Columbia.&nbsp; No matter, the ultimate message left with the jury was clear, namely that it would be dangerous to rely on Mr. Argueta’s evidence without confirmation.&nbsp; Importantly, the jury was told that it was for them to decide whether there was any evidence capable of confirming his testimony.&nbsp; The jury would clearly have understood that in order to acquit the appellant, it did not have to believe that Mr. Argueta was the killer; rather, it had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the killer and that if they had a reasonable doubt, they must acquit.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[67]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Putting aside the appellant’s specific qualms, this ground of appeal can also be resolved with the help of common sense.&nbsp; The problems with Mr. Argueta’s evidence were clear and obvious.&nbsp; The defence position was that Mr. Argueta was the killer and that he was lying in order to frame the appellant.&nbsp; There was evidence he had a motive to kill Mr. Levoir.&nbsp; And even taking his testimony at its highest, Mr. Argueta had committed perjury.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the end of the day, these were the problems the trial judge had to convey to the jury in his charge.&nbsp; In my view, that is exactly what he did.&nbsp; He reminded the jury that the defence position was that Mr. Argueta was the killer.&nbsp; He told them that the appellant’s knowledge of the murder could have come from Mr. Argueta.&nbsp; He brought up Mr. Argueta’s apparent lie to the police, and cautioned the jury that his lack of concern for the oath left open the question of whether they could rely on anything he said.&nbsp; And he told the jury that it would be dangerous to accept Mr. Argueta’s evidence in the absence of confirmatory evidence.&nbsp; Nothing more was required.&nbsp; Trial counsel was apparently of the same view.&nbsp; He made no objection to the trial judge’s instructions regarding Mr. Argueta’s testimony.&nbsp; <span style="line-height:200%">In my view, given that Mr. Argueta was, apart from the appellant, the most critical witness from the perspective of the defence, trial counsel’s failure to object to the charge reinforces my conclusion that the trial judge adequately addressed the concerns raised by Mr. Argueta’s testimony.</span></p>
