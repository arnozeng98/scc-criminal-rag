 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The accused was charged with a number of sexual offences.&nbsp; Defence counsel obtained a pre‑trial order requiring that the Crown disclose the complainants' entire medical, counselling and school records and that the complainants authorize production of such records.&nbsp; The Crown applied to a different judge for directions regarding the disclosure order and for the early appointment of a trial judge.&nbsp; After a trial judge had been appointed, the Crown again sought directions regarding the disclosure order.&nbsp; By this time many of the impugned records had come into its possession.&nbsp; The trial judge made it clear that he was to be provided promptly with therapy records relating to all four complainants.&nbsp; The accused later applied for a judicial stay of proceedings based on non‑disclosure of several items.&nbsp; Crown counsel submitted that the two Crown prosecutors were handling the case from different cities, and that there were difficulties concerning communication and organization.&nbsp; She asserted that the non‑disclosure of some of the medical records was due to inadvertence on her part, and that she had "dreamt" the transcripts of certain interviews had been disclosed.&nbsp; She submitted that uninhibited disclosure of medical and therapeutic records would revictimize the victims, and suggested that the disclosure order exhibited gender bias.&nbsp; The trial judge dismissed the application for a stay, finding that the failure to disclose certain medical records had been an oversight.&nbsp; He noted, however, that the letters written by Crown counsel to the counsellors had unacceptably limited the scope of the disclosure to only those portions of the records which related directly to the incidents involving the accused.&nbsp; This resulted in the full therapy records not being disclosed to the defence until just before the trial.&nbsp; He concluded that while the conduct of the Crown was "disturbing", he did not believe that there was a "grand design" to conceal evidence, nor any "deliberate plan to subvert justice".&nbsp; In light of the difficulties encountered during discovery, Crown counsel then agreed to waive any privilege with respect to the contents of the Crown's file and to prepare a binder in relation to each of the complainants containing all information in the Crown's possession relating to each of them.&nbsp; On the second day of the trial, counsel for the accused made another application for a judicial stay of proceedings based largely on the fact that the Crown was still unable to guarantee to the accused that full disclosure had been made.&nbsp; The trial judge stayed proceedings on all four counts.&nbsp; He noted the constant intervention required by the court to ensure full compliance with the disclosure order and found that the Crown's earlier conduct had created "an aura" that had pervaded and ultimately destroyed the case.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and directed a new trial.&nbsp; This appeal raises the issues of (1)&nbsp;when non‑disclosure by the Crown justifies an order that the proceedings be stayed and (2)&nbsp;the appropriate procedure to be followed when an accused seeks production of documents such as medical or therapeutic records that are in the hands of third parties.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; There is no need to maintain any type of distinction between the common law doctrine of abuse of process and <i>Charter</i> requirements regarding abusive conduct.&nbsp; Where an accused seeks to establish that non-disclosure by the Crown has violated s. 7, he or she must establish that the impugned non-disclosure has, on the balance of probabilities, prejudiced or had an adverse effect on his or her ability to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; Such a determination requires reasonable inquiry into the materiality of the non‑disclosed information.&nbsp; Inferences or conclusions about the propriety of the Crown's conduct or intention are not necessarily relevant to whether or not the accused's right to a fair trial is infringed.&nbsp; The focus must be primarily on the effect of the impugned actions on the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; Once a violation is made out, the court must fashion a just and appropriate remedy, pursuant to s.&nbsp;24(1).&nbsp; Where the adverse impact upon the accused's ability to make full answer and defence is curable by a disclosure order, then such a remedy, combined with an adjournment where necessary to enable defence counsel to review the disclosed information, will generally be appropriate.&nbsp; There may, however, be exceptional situations where, given the advanced state of the proceedings, it is simply not possible to remedy the prejudice.&nbsp; In those "clearest of cases", a stay of proceedings will be appropriate.&nbsp; When choosing a remedy for a non-disclosure that has violated s. 7, the court should also consider whether the Crown's breach of its disclosure obligations has violated fundamental principles underlying the community's sense of decency and fair play and thereby caused prejudice to the integrity of the judicial system.&nbsp; If so, it should be asked whether this prejudice is remediable, having regard to the seriousness of the violation and to the societal and individual interests in obtaining a determination of guilt or innocence.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">While the Crown's conduct in this case was shoddy and inappropriate, the non‑disclosure cannot be said to have violated the accused's right to full answer and defence.&nbsp; The whole issue of disclosure in this case arose out of the order requiring that the Crown "disclose" records in the hands of third parties and that the complainants authorize production of such records.&nbsp; This order was issued without any form of inquiry into their relevance, let alone a balancing of the privacy rights of the complainants and the accused's right to a fair trial, and was thus wrong.&nbsp; The Crown was ultimately right in trying to protect the interests of justice, and the fact that it did so in such a clumsy way should not result in a stay of proceedings, particularly when no prejudice was demonstrated to the fairness of the accused's trial or to his ability to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; Even had a violation of s.&nbsp;7 been found, this cannot be said to be one of the "clearest of cases" which would mandate a stay of proceedings.</span></p>

In that context, we held that an accused was entitled to obtain all of the information in the possession of the Crown, unless the information in question was clearly irrelevant. However, <i>Stinchcombe</i> recognized that, even in the context of disclosure, there are limits on the right of an accused to access information. For example, when the Crown asserts that the information is privileged, the trial judge must then balance the competing claims at issue. In such cases, the information will only be disclosed where the trial judge concludes that the asserted privilege "does not constitute a reasonable limit on the constitutional right to make full answer and defence" (<i>Stinchcombe</i>, at p. 340).</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In light of these considerations, we agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that, at the first stage in the production procedure, the onus should be on the accused to satisfy a judge that the information is <u>likely to be relevant</u>. The onus we place on the accused should not be interpreted as an evidential burden requiring evidence and a <i>voir dire</i> in every case. It is simply an initial threshold to provide a basis for production which can be satisfied by oral submissions of counsel. It is important to recognize that the accused will be in a very poor position to call evidence given that he has never had access to the records. <i>Viva voce</i> evidence and a <i>voir dire</i> may, however, be required in situations in which the presiding judge cannot resolve the matter on the basis of the submissions of counsel. (See <i>Chaplin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 744.)</span></p>

The "likely relevance" stage should be confined to a question of whether the right to make full answer and defence is implicated by information contained in the records.

In the context of production, the test of relevance should be higher: the presiding judge must be satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility that the information is logically probative to <u>an issue at trial or the competence of a witness to testify</u>. When we speak of relevance to "an issue at trial", we are referring not only to evidence that may be probative to the material issues in the case (i.e. the unfolding of events) but also to evidence relating to the credibility of witnesses and to the reliability of other evidence in the case. See <i>R. v. R. (L.)</i> (1995), 39 C.R. (4th) 390 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 398. </span></p>

Generally speaking, records in the hands of third parties find their way into court proceedings by one of two procedures. First, under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec698subsec1" target="_blank">s. 698(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, a party may apply for a subpoena requiring a person to attend where that person is likely to give material evidence in a proceedings. Pursuant to s. 700(1) of the <i>Code</i>, the subpoena is only available for those records in the custodian's possession "relating to the subject-matter of the proceedings".&nbsp; The second method of obtaining production of documents is to apply for a search warrant pursuant to s. 487(1) of the <i>Code</i>. Under s. 487(1)(<i>b</i>) a search warrant will be issued where a justice is satisfied that there is in a building, receptacle or place "anything that there are reasonable grounds to believe will afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence ...". Consequently, under either of these schemes the individual seeking access to third party records must satisfy a neutral arbiter that the records are relevant to the proceedings in question. We agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that the appropriate procedure to follow is via the <i>subpoena</i> <i>duces tecum</i> route. </span></p>

We agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that considerations of privacy should not enter into the analysis at this stage. We should also not be concerned with whether the evidence would be admissible, for example as a matter of policy, as that is a different query&nbsp; (<i>Morris v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190). As the House of Lords recognized in <i>R. v. Preston</i>, [1993] 4 All E.R. 638, at p. 664:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A relevance threshold, at this stage, is simply a requirement to prevent the defence from engaging in "speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming" requests for production.

This Court has recognized on a number of occasions the danger of placing the accused in a "Catch-22" situation as a condition of making full answer and defence (see, for example, <i>Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505, at pp. 1513-14; <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at pp. 1463-64; <i>Carey v. Ontario</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 637; and <i>R. v.

However, it should be remembered that in most cases, an accused will not be privy to the existence of third party records which are maintained under strict rules of confidentiality. Generally speaking, an accused will only become aware of the existence of records because of something which arises in the course of the criminal case. For example, the complainant's psychiatrist, therapist or social worker may come forward and reveal his or her concerns about the complainant (as occurred in <i>R. v. Ross</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 253 (N.S.C.A.), and <i>R. v. Ross</i> (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 234 (N.S.C.A.)). In other cases, the complainant may reveal at the preliminary inquiry or in his or her statement to the police that he or she decided to lay a criminal charge against the accused following a visit with a particular therapist. There is a possibility of materiality where there is a "reasonably close temporal connection between" the creation of the records and the date of the alleged commission of the offence (<i>R. v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 673) or in cases of historical events, as in this case, a close temporal connection between the creation of the records and the decision to bring charges against the accused. </span></p>

Consequently, while we will not attempt to set out categories of relevance, we feel compelled to respond to some of the statements expressed by our colleague.&nbsp; L'Heureux-Dubé J. suggests in her reasons that "the assumption that private therapeutic or counselling records are relevant to full answer and defence is often highly questionable" (para. 109) and that "the vast majority of information noted during therapy sessions bears no relevance whatsoever or, at its highest, only an attenuated sense of relevance to the issues at trial" (para. 144).&nbsp; With respect, we disagree. L'Heureux-Dubé J.'s observation as to the likelihood of relevance belies the reality that in many criminal cases, trial judges have ordered the production of third party records often applying the same principles we have enunciated in this case. The sheer number of decisions in which such evidence has been produced supports the potential relevance of therapeutic records.&nbsp; </span></p>

She suggests that the judge should take account of "the extent to which production of records of this nature would frustrate society's interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences and the acquisition of treatment by victims" as well as "the effect on the integrity of the trial process of producing, or failing to produce, the record, having in mind the need to maintain consideration in the outcome" (para. 156).&nbsp; This last factor is more appropriately dealt with at the admissibility stage and not in deciding whether the information should be produced. As for society's interest in the reporting of sexual crimes, we are of the opinion that there are other avenues available to the judge to ensure that production does not frustrate the societal interests that may be implicated by the production of the records to the defence. A number of these avenues are discussed by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Ryan</i> (1991), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 226, at p. 230:</span></p>

The trial judge has considerable discretion in these matters. It is for the trial judge to determine whether a ban shall be placed on publication. It is for the trial judge to decide whether spectators shall be barred when evidence is given on matters that the trial judge deems to be extremely sensitive and worth excluding from the information available to the public. High on the list is, of course, the matter of relevance. Unless the evidence sought from the witness meets the test of relevancy, it will be excluded. The trial judge is able to apply the well-established rules and tests to determine whether any given piece of evidence is relevant.</span></p>

O'Connor</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 109, which addressed the question of the appropriateness of a stay.&nbsp; However, much of the non-disclosure and late disclosure that formed the basis for the stay of proceedings that is the subject of this appeal related directly to disagreement over the appropriateness of the pre-trial disclosure order made by Campbell A.C.J.&nbsp; As a result, those reasons must be read together as a whole with <i>R. v. O'Connor</i> (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 257 ("<i>O'Connor (No. 2)</i>"), in which the Court of Appeal provided guidelines for future applications for production of medical records held by third parties.&nbsp; Given the national importance of establishing guidelines for such production (in light of the absence of legislative intervention), and the fact that this matter was fully argued before us, it is appropriate for this Court to provide some assistance to lower courts in this respect.&nbsp; Besides, the question is squarely raised in another appeal which was heard by this Court and in which judgment is rendered concurrently with this one:&nbsp; <i>A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.)</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536.&nbsp; As a preliminary matter, however, it is necessary to set out the facts and judgments relevant to each of the two issues raised in this case. </span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at p. 947, where Lamer J. stated that, in certain cases, a <i>Charter</i> stay might be appropriate to remedy a violation of s. 11(<i>b</i>) even where there was no demonstrated prejudice to the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; More recently, in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, at p. 786 (<i>per</i> Sopinka J.), and p. 812 (<i>per</i> McLachlin J.) this Court recognized that, although the primary purpose of s. 11(<i>b</i>) is the protection of the individual rights of the accused, there is also a secondary interest of society as a whole in the prompt, humane, and fair trial of those accused of crimes.&nbsp; Equally apposite are the remarks of Wilson J. in <i>Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General)</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, at p. 1354, who noted that a contextually sensitive approach to <i>Charter</i> rights requires that the private interests reflected therein also be evaluated from the standpoint of the public interests that underlie those private rights.&nbsp; Given that many, if not most, of the individual rights protected in the <i>Charter</i> also have a broader, societal dimension, it is therefore consistent with both the purpose and the spirit of the <i>Charter</i> to look, in certain cases, beyond the possibility of prejudice to the particular accused, to clear cases of prejudice to the integrity of the judicial system.&nbsp; </span></p>

Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission)</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at p. 539 (<i>per</i> La Forest J.); <i>R. v. E.

Levogiannis</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475, at p. 486.&nbsp; As such, they reflect both individual and societal interests.&nbsp; In my view, it is undisputable that the preservation of the integrity of the judicial system is one of these interests.</span></p>

Xenos</i> (1991), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 362 (Que. C.A.), for instance, the accused had been charged with arson and attempting to defraud an insurance company.&nbsp; It emerged in cross-examination that the Crown's key witness had arranged with the insurers to be paid $50,000 by the insurers if the accused was convicted.&nbsp; The trial judge found an abuse of process, but declined to order a stay.&nbsp; Rather, in convicting the accused, he said that he had ignored this evidence.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal agreed in principle with the trial judge that a stay was not the only remedy for an abuse of process and went on to rule that the appropriate remedy was in fact to exclude the witness's testimony in a new trial before a different judge.&nbsp; This case is an excellent example, in my mind, of how courts are becoming increasingly bold and innovative in finding appropriate remedies in lieu of stays for abuses of process.&nbsp; Professor Stuesser points out in "Abuse of Process: The Need to Reconsider" (1994), 29 C.R. (4th) 92, at p. 99, moreover, that the common law in the United Kingdom and Australia urges judges to look at lesser remedies before entering stays of proceedings.&nbsp; He argues that these authorities support the view that even under the common law, the remedy for abuse of process is no longer only a stay of proceedings. </span></p>

Keyowski</i> (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 553 (Sask. C.A.), at pp. 561-62, for instance, it was noted that while the burden of proof under the <i>Charter</i> was the balance of probabilities, the burden under the common law was the "clearest of cases".&nbsp; It is important to remember, however, that even if a violation of s. 7 is proved on a balance of probabilities, the court must still determine what remedy is just and appropriate under s. 24(1).&nbsp; The power granted in s. 24(1) is in terms discretionary, and it is by no means automatic that a stay of proceedings should be granted for a violation of s. 7.&nbsp; On the contrary, I would think that the remedy of a judicial stay of proceedings would be appropriate under s. 24(1) only in the clearest of cases.&nbsp; In this way, the threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings remains, under the <i>Charter</i> as under the common law doctrine of abuse of process, the "clearest of cases".</span></p>

Burlingham</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, where, although I agreed with the majority that the Crown's conduct in disregarding the plea bargain made with the accused did not amount to one of the "clearest of cases" requiring a stay of proceedings, I would have nonetheless found a violation of the accused's rights under s. 7 and substituted a conviction for the lesser included offence which was the object of the plea bargain).</span></p>

In the instant case, however, absent any inquiry into the materiality of the non-disclosures, the most that can be said is that the non-disclosures arose as a result of inadvertence or lack of communication on the part of the two Crown counsel, or because Crown counsel undertook to bite off more voluntary disclosure than it could chew.&nbsp; There is no proof, moreover, that any delays were attributable to Crown non-disclosure.&nbsp; If indeed there were such delays, then it is relevant to note that, since the accused was not incarcerated pending trial, these delays would not have prolonged the duration of the accused's imprisonment.</span></p>

Gingras</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 53 (Alta. C.A.). </span></p>

Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 361.&nbsp; Moreover, though the Constitution guarantees the accused a fair hearing, it does not guarantee the most favourable procedures imaginable:&nbsp; <i>Lyons</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 362.&nbsp; Finally, although fairness of the trial and, as a corollary, fairness in defining the limits of full answer and defence, must primarily be viewed from the point of view of the accused, both notions must nevertheless also be considered from the point of view of the community and the complainant:&nbsp; <i>E. (A.W.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 198.&nbsp; There is no question that the right to make full answer and defence cannot be so broad as to grant the defence a fishing licence into the personal and private lives of others.&nbsp; The question is therefore not <u>whether</u> the defence can be limited in its attempts to obtain production of private records held by third parties, but <u>how</u> it can be limited in a manner that accords appropriate constitutional protection to all of the constitutional rights at issue.</span></p>

Ontario</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 637, <i>Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505 (especially at pp. 1513-14), <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, and <i>R. v. Durette</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 469, and conclude that the standard of "likely relevance" should not be interpreted as an onerous burden.&nbsp; I would begin by noting that <i>Carey</i> arose in the context of a civil action in which neither the right to full answer and defence nor any constitutional right of privacy were engaged; it therefore has no application here.&nbsp; As for <i>Dersch</i>, <i>Garofoli</i> and <i>Durette</i>, a majority of this Court held in those cases that an accused is entitled to have access to information used by police to obtain a wiretap authorization because, without such access, the accused cannot realistically challenge the legality of the surveillance.&nbsp; However, in those cases, the accused sought access to records created by the state as part of its investigation; that situation can hardly be compared to the situation of an accused who demands access to therapeutic or other private records created and held by a third party.&nbsp; The records here in question are not within the possession or control of the Crown, do not form part of the Crown's "case to meet", and were created by a third party for a purpose unrelated to the investigation or prosecution of the offence.&nbsp; In my opinion, it cannot be assumed that such records are likely to be relevant, and if the accused is unable to show that they are, then the application for production must be rejected as it amounts to nothing more than a fishing expedition.</span></p>

Egger</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451; <i>Chaplin</i>, <i>supra</i>), it may be necessary to reassess the extent to which the "discovery" rationale remains appropriate as a consideration in the conduct of the modern-day preliminary inquiry.</span></p>

Harrer</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562.&nbsp; What constitutes a fair trial takes into account not only the perspective of the accused, but the practical limits of the system of justice and the lawful interests of others involved in the process, like complainants and the agencies which assist them in dealing with the trauma they may have suffered.&nbsp; Perfection in justice is as chimeric as perfection in any other social agency.&nbsp; What the law demands is not perfect justice, but fundamentally fair justice.</span></p>
