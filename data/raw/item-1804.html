Iacobucci J., by contrast, finds there were.&nbsp; I find myself in agreement with the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; The victim Cook, who had another woman and two other people in his car, encountered his girlfriend at a service station.&nbsp; They conversed.&nbsp; He told her that he was going to do an Autopac scam with the accused later that night.&nbsp; They parted.&nbsp; The question is whether the circumstances of&nbsp; this encounter cast suspicion on whether the victim‚Äôs statement represented his actual intention at the time he spoke.&nbsp; It is argued that the circumstances suggest that he may have made up the Autopac scam story to explain or offset the presence of another woman in his car.&nbsp; It is not clear to me how the statement that he intended to do an Autopac scam <u>with the accused</u> explains why another woman would be in the car with him.&nbsp; Nor is it clear how the statement countered the suggestion that the victim was romantically involved with the woman in the car. It begs the question, ‚ÄúIf you are doing an Autopac scam with someone else later tonight, why are you with this woman?‚Äù&nbsp; If the victim had said he intended to do the scam with the woman, it might have attracted suspicion as to whether it represented his actual intentions.&nbsp; But that is not what occurred.&nbsp; Accordingly, I would admit the statement as evidence of what the deceased intended to do at the time he made the statement.</p>

Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada </i>(2nd ed. 1999), at p. 176.&nbsp; The rule against hearsay is ‚Äúfounded on a lack of faith in the capacity of the trier of fact properly to evaluate evidence of a statement‚Äù:&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 935.&nbsp; The modern trend to reform the rules of evidence in general and the hearsay rules in particular constitutes a sharp break from this distrust of the jury.&nbsp; As the Law Reform Commission of Canada explained in its 1975 <i>Report on Evidence</i>, at p. 5:</p>

Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 623.&nbsp; In the specific context of hearsay evidence, Lamer C.J. speaking for a unanimous Court in <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 932, explained that ‚Äú[t]he movement towards a flexible approach was motivated by the realization that, as a general rule, reliable evidence ought not to be excluded simply because it cannot be tested by cross-examination.‚Äù&nbsp; Our motivation in reforming the rules of evidence has been ‚Äúa genuine attempt to bring the relevant and probative evidence before the trier of fact in order to foster the search for truth‚Äù:&nbsp; <i>Levogiannis</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 487.&nbsp; These principles must guide all of our evidentiary reform endeavours.</p>

The function of the trial judge is limited to determining whether the particular hearsay statement exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement. More specifically, the judge must identify the specific hearsay dangers raised by the statement, and then determine whether the facts surrounding the utterance of the statement offer sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to compensate for those dangers. The ultimate reliability of the statement, and the weight to be attached to it, remain determinations for the trier of fact.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:13.4pt">The difference between the statement of intention by Mr. Cook to Young and the statement of intention by Mr. Cook to Giesbrecht is that Cook carried the Giesbrecht intention out, didn‚Äôt he?&nbsp; He ended up in a car, say the prosecution, driving down a ditch, smashing it up outside of the Turski home.&nbsp; He travelled all that way.&nbsp; He had to have; he was found dead there, and the car that was smashed against the pole was the car that Starr had been in, in the Mohawk garage.&nbsp; So that expression of intention appears to have been carried out. . . .</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">I believe that the Crown was entitled to ask the jury to draw an inference that Cook in fact acted in accordance with his stated intention, even if that stated intention involved a joint act: see<i> P.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The words "reasonable doubt" are used in their everyday, ordinary sense and not as a legal term having some special connotation. The words have no magic meaning that is peculiar to the law. A reasonable doubt is an honest, fair doubt, based upon reason and common sense. It is a real doubt, not an imaginary or frivolous one resting on speculation or guess rather than upon the evidence you heard in this courtroom.</p>

If you cannot say those words ‚Äë‚Äë if you cannot say, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, the Crown has not met the onus on it, and the accused is entitled to have your doubt resolved in his favour.</p>

This portion of the charge did not equate proof beyond a reasonable doubt to proof to a moral certainty (<i>Lifchus</i>, at paras. 25 and 37); nor did it instruct jurors that they might convict if they were ‚Äúsure‚Äù that the accused was guilty (<i>Lifchus</i>, at para. 37); nor did it invite jurors to apply the same standard of proof that they apply to important decisions in their own lives (<i>Lifchus</i>, at para. 37; <i>Bisson</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; Elsewhere in his charge, the trial judge exhorted the jury to put any feelings of prejudice or sympathy out of their minds&nbsp; (<i>Lifchus</i>, at paras. 31 and 36).</p>

Abbey</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24,&nbsp; at pp. 40-41, <i>per</i> Dickson J. (as he then was), citing <i>Phipson on Evidence</i> (12th ed. 1976 (supplemented to 1980)), para. 625, at pp. 263-64.&nbsp; More recent definitions of hearsay have focussed upon the precise evidentiary concerns underlying the exclusionary rule, namely the absence of an opportunity for meaningful, contemporaneous cross-examination of the out-of-court declarant in court under oath or solemn affirmation, regarding the truth of the specific statement or expressive conduct that is sought to be admitted as proof of its contents.&nbsp; The central concern revolves around the inability to test the reliability of the declarant‚Äôs assertion.&nbsp; As stated by the Law Reform Commission of Canada in its 1975 <i>Report on Evidence</i>, at pp. 68-69:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Hearsay statements are excluded from evidence in trials because of the difficulty of testing their reliability.&nbsp; If a person who actually observed a fact is not in court, but a statement he made to someone about it is introduced in evidence, there is no way of inquiring into that person‚Äôs perception, memory, narration or sincerity.&nbsp; His statement about the fact might be false because he misperceived it or did not remember it correctly, or he may have misled the person to whom it was made because he used words not commonly used, or he may simply have lied about it.&nbsp; These factors, which determine the reliability of his statement, can only be tested if he is in the courtroom and subject to cross-examination.</p>

M. Morgan, ‚ÄúHearsay Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay Concept‚Äù (1948), 62 <i>Harv. L. Rev.</i> 177; S.

Sharp</i>, [1988] 1 W.L.R. 7, at p. 11.&nbsp; Though formulated differently, the definition of hearsay promulgated by the United States Federal Rule of Evidence 801 is similar: ‚Äú‚ÄòHearsay‚Äô is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted‚Äù.&nbsp; ‚ÄúStatement‚Äù is defined as ‚Äú(1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion‚Äù.&nbsp; The most recent edition of Professor McCormick‚Äôs treatise on evidence (<i>McCormick on Evidence</i> (5th ed. 1999), vol. 2, at ¬ß 246) has adopted this definition.</p>

Younger,<i> An Irreverent Introduction to Hearsay</i> (1977), an address to the American Bar Association Annual Meeting, Atlanta, Georgia, August 11, 1976.&nbsp; In short, the essential defining features of hearsay are the <u>purpose</u> for which the evidence is adduced, and the absence of a meaningful opportunity to <u>cross-examine</u> the declarant in court under oath or solemn affirmation as to the truth of its contents.</p>

In short, the intention to ‚Äúgo and do an Autopac scam with Robert‚Äù is the content of Cook‚Äôs statement, and the Crown sought to use the statement as proof of its contents.</p>

United States</i>, 432 A.2d 739 (D.C. App. 1981), at pp. 745-46; <i>United States v. Brown</i>, 490 F.2d 758 (D.C. Cir. 1973); <i>People v. Madson</i>, 638 P.2d 18 (Colo. 1981).&nbsp; See also <i>Shepard v. United States</i>, 290 U.S. 96 (1933), at pp. 105-6; D. Kiesel, ‚ÄúOne Person‚Äôs Thoughts, Another Person‚Äôs Acts: How the Federal Circuit Courts Interpret the <i>Hillmon</i> Doctrine‚Äù (1984), 33 <i>Cath. U. L. Rev.</i> 699, at pp. 738-39; and J. M.

Carter</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938; Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 303-7.&nbsp; This is no doubt what Doherty J. was referring to in <i>P.

In the interest of fairness for the litigant against whom it is used, unreliable hearsay evidence should never be admitted.&nbsp; Apart from that, a review of the traditional exceptions reveals that there are reasons beyond ‚Äúpure‚Äù necessity why a court might wish to admit reliable hearsay evidence.&nbsp; This point was addressed by Lamer C.J. in <i>B. (K.G.)</i>, at pp. 796-97, where he explained that the need to permit the admission of certain forms of hearsay can stem not only from the unavailability of the out-of-court declarant, but also from the quality of the evidence itself.&nbsp; Lamer C.J. cited Professor Wigmore‚Äôs explanation (<i>Wigmore on Evidence</i>, vol. 5 (Chadbourn rev. 1974), at p. 253) that some hearsay evidence ‚Äúmay be such that we cannot expect, again, or at this time, to get <i>evidence of the same value</i> from the same or other sources‚Äù (emphasis in original).&nbsp; Such hearsay may be admitted, where appropriate, less on the basis of necessity and more on the basis of ‚Äúexpediency or convenience‚Äù.&nbsp; The traditional exceptions are useful, therefore, because they are instructive as to the types of situations that may produce hearsay that is the best evidence in the circumstances.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:67.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Other exceptions are based not on negating traditional hearsay dangers, but on the fact that the statement provides circumstantial guarantees of reliability.&nbsp; This approach is embodied in recognized exceptions such as dying declarations, spontaneous utterances, and statements against pecuniary interest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Archibald, ‚ÄúThe Canadian Hearsay Revolution: Is Half a Loaf Better Than No Loaf at All?‚Äù (1999), 25 <i>Queen‚Äôs L.J.</i> 1, at p. 34. Conversely, the presence of a motive to lie may be grounds for exclusion of evidence under the principled approach.&nbsp; Put another way, it is the role of the trial judge to determine threshold reliability by satisfying him- or herself that notwithstanding the absence of the declarant for cross-examination purposes, the statement possesses sufficient elements of reliability that it should be passed on to be considered by the trier of fact.</p>

Stewart, ‚ÄúPrior Identifications and Hearsay: A Note on <i>R. v. Tat</i>‚Äù (1998), 3 <i>Can. Crim. L. Rev.</i> 61.&nbsp; The point is that the officer‚Äôs testimony should merely state who the witness identified, once the witness has already testified to the identification itself, and why the identification is relevant to the case.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It is rarely possible to prove anything with absolute certainty and so the burden of proof on the Crown is only to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; What, then, is proof beyond a reasonable doubt?</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The words ‚Äúreasonable doubt‚Äù are used in their everyday, ordinary sense and not as a legal term having some special connotation.&nbsp; The words have no magic meaning that is peculiar to the law.&nbsp; A reasonable doubt is an honest, fair doubt, based upon reason and common sense.&nbsp; It is a real doubt, not an imaginary or frivolous one resting on speculation or guess rather than upon the evidence you heard in this courtroom.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">So you can see, the words ‚Äúreasonable doubt‚Äù are ordinary words we use in our everyday language.&nbsp; So if you can say, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, the Crown has met the onus upon it.&nbsp; If you cannot say those words -- if you cannot say, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, the Crown has not met the onus on it, and the accused is entitled to have your doubt resolved in his favour.</p>

The additional instructions to the jury set out in <i>Lifchus</i> as to the meaning and appropriate manner of determining the existence of a reasonable doubt serve to define the space between absolute certainty and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In this regard, I am in agreement with Twaddle J.A. in the court below, when he said, at p. 177:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">If standards of proof were marked on a measure, proof ‚Äúbeyond reasonable doubt‚Äù would lie much closer to ‚Äúabsolute certainty‚Äù than to ‚Äúa balance of probabilities‚Äù.&nbsp; Just as a judge has a duty to instruct the jury that absolute certainty is not required, he or she has a duty, in my view, to instruct the jury that the criminal standard is more than a probability.&nbsp; The words he or she uses to convey this idea are of no significance, but the idea itself must be conveyed....</p>
