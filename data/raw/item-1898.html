(“AIM”), which was owned and controlled by L, to assist in marketing Sagaz’s seat covers.&nbsp; S was to receive two percent of all sales from L and AIM and incorporated a sham corporation to receive this money.&nbsp; S’s wrongdoing was discovered and his employment was terminated.&nbsp; New management at Canadian Tire determined it preferred the seat cover products of Sagaz to those of Design and retained Sagaz as its supplier.&nbsp; Having lost its major customer, Design’s manufacturing business went into a steep decline and, in 1989, Design brought an action alleging that AIM, L, Sagaz and K, Sagaz’s president, had bribed S and, but for the bribes, Design would have continued as supplier to Canadian Tire.&nbsp; At trial, damages were assessed against L and AIM, jointly and severally, including punitive damages.&nbsp; The action was dismissed as against Sagaz and K.&nbsp; After the trial judge’s reasons for judgment were released, but before formal judgement was entered, L, who did not testify at trial, gave Design an affidavit admitting to the conspiracy to bribe S and implicating K in it.&nbsp; On the basis of the affidavit, Design brought a motion to have the trial reopened to hear L’s fresh evidence.&nbsp; The trial judge dismissed the motion.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal reversed the decisions of the trial judge, finding that Sagaz was vicariously liable to Design and therefore jointly and severally liable with L and AIM for the damages awarded, with the exception of punitive damages.&nbsp; A new trial was ordered with respect to the liability of K on the basis that the trial judge should have reopened the trial to hear L’s evidence.</span></p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Court of Appeal erred in holding Sagaz vicariously liable to Design.&nbsp; Although the categories of relationships in law that attract vicarious liability are neither exhaustively defined nor closed, the most common one to give rise to vicarious liability is the relationship between master and servant, now more commonly called employer and employee.&nbsp; This is distinguished from the relationship of an employer and independent contractor which, subject to certain limited exceptions, typically does not give rise to a claim for vicarious liability.&nbsp; The main policy concerns justifying vicarious liability are to provide a just and practical remedy for the plaintiff’s harm and to encourage the deterrence of future harm.&nbsp; Vicarious liability is fair in principle because the hazards of the business should be borne by the business itself; thus, it does not make sense to anchor liability on an employer for acts of an independent contractor, someone who was in business on his or her own account.&nbsp; In addition, the employer does not have the same control over an independent contractor as over an employee to reduce accidents and intentional wrongs by efficient organization and supervision.&nbsp; There is no one conclusive test which can be universally applied to determine whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor.&nbsp; What must always occur is a search for the total relationship of the parties.&nbsp; The central question is whether the person who has been engaged to perform the services is performing them as a person in business on his own account.&nbsp; In making this determination, the level of control the employer has over the worker’s activities will always be a factor.&nbsp; However, other factors to consider include whether the worker provides his or her own equipment, whether the worker hires his or her own helpers, the degree of financial risk taken by the worker, the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker, and the worker’s opportunity for profit in the performance of his or her tasks.&nbsp; Although the contract designated AIM as an “independent contractor”, this classification is not always determinative for the purposes of vicarious liability.&nbsp; Looking at the non-exhaustive list of factors set out in <i>Market Investigations</i>, it is clear, based on the total relationship of the parties, that AIM was an independent contractor.&nbsp; On the totality of the evidence, AIM was in business on its own account.&nbsp; Absent exceptional circumstances which are not present in this case, it follows that the relationship between Sagaz and AIM, as employer and independent contractor, is not one which attracts vicarious liability. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Court of Appeal erred in substituting its discretion for that of the trial judge in deciding to reopen the trial.&nbsp; Absent an error of law, an appellate court should not interfere with the exercise by a trial judge of his or her discretion in the conduct of a trial.&nbsp; Appellate courts should defer to the trial judge, who is in the best position to decide whether fairness dictates that the trial be reopened.&nbsp; The case law dictates that the trial judge must exercise his discretion to reopen the trial “sparingly and with the greatest care” so that “fraud and abuse of the Court’s processes” do not result.&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge decided not to exercise his discretion to reopen the trial because neither of the two steps of the test in <i>Scott</i> was met to his satisfaction.&nbsp; First, he could not say that the new evidence, if presented at trial, would probably have changed the result, only that it may have changed the result.&nbsp; Second, the trial judge found that L’s evidence could have been obtained before trial.&nbsp; L’s affidavit evidence contradicts his sworn evidence on discovery, particularly with respect to the existence of the bribery scheme which L avoids acknowledging on discovery.&nbsp; Evidence which is not presumptively credible may fail to probably change the result under the first branch of the test in <i>Scott</i>.&nbsp; This is how the trial judge dealt with the affidavit evidence, and he was correct in so doing.</span></p>

H. L. Fridman, <i>The Law of Torts in Canada</i> (1990), vol. 2, at pp. 314-15, and P. S. Atiyah, <i>Vicarious Liability in the Law of Torts</i> (1967), at pp. 6-7).</p>

line-height:24.4pt">31<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, vicarious liability provides a just and practical remedy to people who suffer harm as a consequence of wrongs perpetrated by an employee.&nbsp; Many commentators are suspicious of vicarious liability in principle because it appears to hold parties responsible for harm simply because they have “deep pockets” or an ability to bear the loss even though they are not personally at fault.&nbsp; The “deep pockets” justification on its own does not accord with an inherent sense of what is fair (see also R. Flannigan, “Enterprise control: The servant-independent contractor distinction” (1987), 37 <i>U.T.L.J</i>. 25, at p. 29).&nbsp; Besides an ability to bear the loss, it must also seem just to place liability for the wrong on the employer.&nbsp; McLachlin J. addresses this concern in <i>Bazley</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 31:</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Vicarious liability is arguably fair in this sense.&nbsp; The employer puts in the community an enterprise which carries with it certain risks.&nbsp; When those risks materialize and cause injury to a member of the public despite the employer’s reasonable efforts, it is fair that the person or organization that creates the enterprise and hence the risk should bear the loss.&nbsp; This accords with the notion that it is right and just that the person who creates a risk bear the loss when the risk ripens into harm.</p>

  <div class="Section17"> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Similarly, Fleming stated that “a person who employs others to advance his own economic interest should in fairness be placed under a corresponding liability for losses incurred in the course of the enterprise” (p. 410).&nbsp; McLachlin J. states that while the fairness of this proposition is capable of standing alone, “it is buttressed by the fact that the employer is often in the best position to spread the losses through mechanisms like insurance and higher prices, thus minimizing the dislocative effect of the tort within society” (<i>Bazley</i>, at para. 31).&nbsp; Finally on this point, it is noteworthy that vicarious liability does not diminish the personal liability of the direct tortfeasor (Fleming, <i>supra</i>, at p. 411; <i>London Drugs</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 460, <i>per</i> McLachlin J.).</p>

Kidner, “Vicarious liability: for whom should the ‘employer’ be liable?” (1995), 15 <i>Legal Stud.</i> 47, at p. 60).&nbsp; As MacGuigan J.A. further noted in <i>Wiebe Door</i>, if the main test is to demonstrate that, without the work of the alleged employees the employer would be out of business, a factual relationship of mutual dependency would always meet the organization test of an employee even though this criterion may not accurately reflect the parties’ intrinsic relationship (pp. 562-63).</p>

line-height:24.4pt">62<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge decided not to exercise his discretion to reopen the trial because neither of the two steps of the test in <i>Scott</i>, <i>supra</i>, was met to his satisfaction.&nbsp; First, he found that he could not say that the new evidence, if presented at trial, would probably have changed the result, only that it may have changed the result.&nbsp; If the trial were to be reopened, Landow’s evidence might well not be believed.&nbsp; His credibility would be in issue.&nbsp; Second, the trial judge found that Landow’s evidence could have been obtained before trial.&nbsp; Design could have compelled Landow to testify under oath at trial.&nbsp; While this carried some risk, the trial judge viewed it as a trial strategy, a conclusion he was entitled to reach.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">63<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the Court of Appeal erred in substituting its discretion for that of the trial judge in deciding to reopen the trial.&nbsp; On the first branch of the test set out in <i>Scott</i>, the trial judge found that Landow’s credibility would be in issue whereas the Court of Appeal found it difficult to see how the trial judge could make this determination without hearing Landow testify.&nbsp; In the Court of Appeal’s determination, it was not sufficiently clear that Landow would be disbelieved.&nbsp; I disagree with the Court of Appeal on this point.&nbsp; Landow’s affidavit evidence contradicts his sworn evidence on discovery, particularly with respect to the existence of the bribery scheme which Landow avoids acknowledging on discovery.&nbsp; To this significant extent, Landow is akin to a recanting liar.&nbsp; Lord Denning’s comments in <i>Ladd v. Marshall</i>, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1489 (C.A.), at p. 1491, are applicable:</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It is very rare that application is made to this court for a new trial on the ground that a witness has told a lie.&nbsp; The principles to be applied are the same as those always applied when fresh evidence is sought to be introduced.&nbsp; To justify the reception of fresh evidence or a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled:&nbsp; first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; thirdly, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
14.4pt;line-height:24.4pt"><u>We have to apply those principles to the case where a witness comes and says: “I told a lie but nevertheless I now want to ‘tell the truth’”.&nbsp; It seems to me that the fresh evidence of such a witness will not as a rule satisfy the third condition.&nbsp; A confessed liar cannot usually be accepted as being credible.</u>&nbsp; To justify the reception of the fresh evidence, some good reason must be shown why a lie was told in the first instance, and good ground given for thinking the witness will tell the truth on the second occasion.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:24.4pt">64<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These comments, in my opinion, apply with equal force to the present case.&nbsp; Landow is akin to a “recanting liar” because he failed to tell his “truth” when he had the opportunity to do so on discovery and again when he declined to testify at trial.&nbsp; Although the determination in <i>Ladd</i> was made under the third branch of the test applied in that case, a branch that is absent from the two-part test in <i>Scott</i>, the application of the <i>Scott</i> test to the situation of a “recanting liar” has the same result in this case.&nbsp; Evidence which is not presumptively credible may fail to probably change the result under the first branch of the test in <i>Scott</i>.&nbsp; This is how the trial judge dealt with the affidavit evidence, and in my view he was correct in so doing.&nbsp; Further, it cannot be ignored that the trial decision imposing liability on Landow and AIM provided incentive for Landow to attempt to shift some responsibility to Kavana in order to share the liability of the corresponding damage award.&nbsp; The trial judge had also seen the evidence of Kavana in the first instance, which he found to be credible even in the face of a vigorous cross-examination.</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt;
line-height:24.4pt">65<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court in <i>Scott</i> mandated that both branches of the test to reopen a trial to admit fresh evidence must be met.&nbsp; Having failed to meet the first branch of the test, it is unnecessary to examine whether the precluded evidence in this case could have been obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.&nbsp; It is sufficient to say that that too is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial judge and, absent error by him, that finding should not be interfered with.</p>
