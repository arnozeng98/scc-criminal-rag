200%"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Deschamps, Charron and Rothstein&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; It is dangerous for a trial judge to instruct the jury in a manner that suggests that inculpatory and exculpatory statements ought to be weighed differently.&nbsp; The issue of whether a <i>Duncan</i>‑type instruction constitutes misdirection in any given case will depend entirely on the particular words used and their context.&nbsp; Where, as here, the instruction is couched in terms of a legal presumption, the prejudicial effect may be difficult to overcome.&nbsp; However, in the circumstances of this case, this unfortunate instruction, although given in error, could not realistically have impacted on the verdict.&nbsp; The letters contained no admissions in respect of which the impugned instruction could be applied.&nbsp; The Crown did not rely on anything in the letters as an admission against the accused’s interest.&nbsp; It relied, rather, on the fact that the accused, by his letters, presented an ever‑changing story, tried to influence witnesses and misled the police in their investigation, and blamed others for his actions, arguing that these were not the actions of an innocent man.&nbsp; This was a permissible inference to be drawn from the totality of the evidence and one which is not in any way affected by the unfortunate use of the presumptive language in the judge’s instructions.&nbsp; Nothing in the charge would have prevented the jury from making appropriate use of the protestations of innocence contained in the letters and relied upon by the defence.&nbsp; The trial judge emphasized to the jury that it was up to them to decide how much weight to give to the statements, and that they could accept all of them, some of them, or none of them.&nbsp; She also repeatedly told the jury that the accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt raised by the evidence, including a reasonable doubt raised by the exculpatory statements in the letters.

Court of Appeal judgment, at paras. 106-7).&nbsp; It seems reasonable to expect that this could well have tempered any concerns the defence might have had that he would become an easy target for impeachment, in view of his criminal past.&nbsp; Defence counsel’s failure to seek him out may well have reflected these considerations — both of which would have been mitigated had the withheld evidence been disclosed — rather than a determination that Mr. Maze’s evidence would have been unhelpful.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Maze’s statement to the police does not say that Madinsky in fact saw it. [para. 37]</p>

Rojas</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 111, 2008 SCC 56, released concurrently, the mixed statement instruction originates from the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Duncan</i>.&nbsp; For reasons stated in <i>Rojas</i>, I agree with the court below that it is dangerous for a trial judge to instruct the jury in a manner that suggests that inculpatory and exculpatory statements ought to be weighed differently.&nbsp; I therefore conclude that the <i>Duncan</i> instruction should not be adopted by Canadian trial courts.</p>

I respectfully disagree that the impugned instruction could reasonably have been interpreted by the jury as requiring them, as a matter of law, to favour the Crown’s <i>theory</i> of guilt as Rowles J.A. concludes (at para. 89), a view which my colleagues seemingly endorse (para. 20).</p>

Well, basically my place was pretty small .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but we had a -- I think it’s a balcony or a porch, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I like my blinds closed all the time because people are always looking in, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it could have been there without me knowing, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. due to the fact it could be on the balcony” (A.R., at p. 364).&nbsp; Hence, Mr. Madinsky agreed that the bucket <i>could</i> have been on his balcony.&nbsp; In my view, it is unrealistic for the appellant to suggest that Mr. Madinsky’s testimony would have been any different if confronted with Maze’s statement at trial and, in turn, that this additional item of evidence would have added anything of significance.</p>
