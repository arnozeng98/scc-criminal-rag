This appeal is to determine whether a businessman who diverts the proceeds of goods received for resale to a gambling scheme may be found guilty of fraud.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the <i>mens rea</i>, fraud by "other fraudulent means" does not require that the accused subjectively appreciate the dishonesty of his acts.&nbsp; The accused must knowingly, i.e. subjectively, undertake the conduct which constitutes the dishonest act, and must subjectively appreciate that the consequences of such conduct could be deprivation, in the sense of causing another to lose his pecuniary interest in certain property or in placing that interest at risk.&nbsp; Here, although the trial judge made no explicit finding that the accused subjectively appreciated that in gambling he was subjecting the interests of others to the risk of deprivation, the accused's cross‚Äëexamination shows that he did and there is nothing in the evidence which negates the natural inference that when a person gambles with funds in which others have a pecuniary interest he knowingly subjects that interest to risk.&nbsp; In convicting, the trial judge must have concluded that the necessary <i>mens rea </i>was present.&nbsp; It is no defence that the accused believed he would win at the casinos and be able to pay his suppliers.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. (dissenting):&nbsp; The accused's suppliers do not have a pecuniary interest in a proprietary sense in the monies which the accused used for gambling.&nbsp; They had the same interest as all creditors, that is, an interest in being paid.&nbsp; The wrongful appropriation of that interest is not fraud unless, in certain circumstances, non‚Äëpayment of a debt can amount to fraud.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge did not make the necessary findings to support a conviction for fraud.&nbsp; Although there was evidence which, if accepted, would have resulted in a finding that the accused accepted the goods from his suppliers with no intention to pay, thereby satisfying the first element of the definition of fraud on the ground of either deceit or falsehood, there was also evidence tending the other way and this Court should not make original findings of fact on disputed evidence.&nbsp; The trial judge's statement that the accused had no concern, desire or preoccupation as regards payment of his suppliers should not be taken as a finding that there was no intention to pay when the goods were supplied.&nbsp; As for a conviction for fraud by "other fraudulent means", while the accused's belief that an act is honest will not avail if it is objectively dishonest as determined by reasonable persons, it is important to distinguish between a belief in the honesty of one's actions and an honest belief in facts which would make the <i>actus reus</i> non‚Äëculpable.&nbsp; Where a person uses his own funds in a way which jeopardizes his ability to repay his creditors, the conduct can only be stigmatized as dishonest if he does so knowingly.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The honest belief of the accused is relevant at three stages in assessing whether the offence of fraud is established.&nbsp; The application of the objective test for dishonesty requires the reasonable person to take into account the state of mind of the accused. This is implicit in the term "dishonest".&nbsp; The honest belief of the accused is also relevant when dealing with the requirement of <i>mens rea</i> for dishonesty and for deprivation.&nbsp; In the latter case, knowledge of deprivation (or risk thereof) or recklessness must be proved.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The creditors do not have a "pecuniary interest" in the monies which the accused used for gambling in the sense in which the corporation has an interest in its money which is directed to private purposes.&nbsp; Although creditors have "an interest" in being paid, that does not give them a pecuniary interest in a proprietary sense unless the relationship with their debtor is such that the monies are impressed with a trust.&nbsp; There is no such suggestion here.&nbsp; The fact that creditors are interested in being paid gives them no legal interest.&nbsp; If they had a legal interest, the wrongful appropriation of that interest would not only constitute fraud "in appropriate circumstances" but would constitute theft.&nbsp; Furthermore, we would not be concerned with the social utility of the expenditure.&nbsp; A lawyer who removes money from his or her trust account without the client's consent is guilty of theft even if it is spent to pay medical bills for a dying mother.&nbsp; This is not a case like <i>R. v. Olan</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175, which involved a variation of a familiar scheme that made the rounds during the latter half of this century.&nbsp; Officers or directors of a corporation cooperating with third parties desirous of using the corporation's assets for their own purpose would structure a transaction which had the appearance of legitimacy but in fact was a sham.&nbsp; It usually involved the sale of "moose pasture" to the corporation by an entity formed or controlled by the fraudulent parties who then profited therefrom.&nbsp; See, for example, <i>Cox v. The Queen</i>, [1963] S.C.R. 500, and <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1963] 1 O.R. 249 (C.A.).</span></p>

Reid</i> (1940), 74 C.C.C. 156 (B.C.C.A.), and <i>R. v. Charters</i> (1957), 119 C.C.C. 223 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp; In such a case, the deprivation would be made out by reason of the fact that the suppliers parted with their goods by reason of the deceit or falsehood.&nbsp; Accordingly, dishonest deprivation would be made out.&nbsp; Although there was evidence tending to support this conclusion, there was also evidence which, if accepted, tended the other way.&nbsp; This Court should not make original findings of fact on disputed evidence.&nbsp; While the trial judge stated that the accused had no concern, desire or preoccupation as regards payment of his creditors, I do not take this as a finding that there was no intention to pay when the goods were supplied.</span></p>

D. Ewart, <i>Criminal Fraud</i> (1986), at p. 99:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The honest belief of the accused is relevant at three stages in assessing whether the offence of fraud is established.&nbsp; First, even the application of the objective test for dishonesty requires the reasonable person to take into account the state of mind of the accused.&nbsp; It is impossible to assess whether an act is dishonest without assessing the mind of the actor.&nbsp; This is implicit in the term "dishonest".&nbsp; The state of mind of the accused is also examined in dealing with the requirement of <i>mens rea</i> for dishonesty.&nbsp; Although this is a subjective test, it is really a duplication of the application of the objective standard of dishonesty.&nbsp; Finally, in a case involving risk of deprivation, knowledge of the risk is a required mental element.&nbsp; In this regard, my colleague states at p. 000 that "[t]his accused knew precisely what he was doing and knew that it would have the consequence of <u>putting his creditors' pecuniary interest at risk</u>" (emphasis added).&nbsp; This certainly is the position taken by the respondent, that by gambling, the appellant knowingly placed the property of the creditors at risk because he jeopardized their chances of repayment.&nbsp; In <i>Th√©roux</i>, my colleague properly points out that with respect to deprivation or risk thereof, either knowledge or recklessness must be proved.&nbsp; In the latter case, "knowledge of the likelihood" of the deprivation or risk is required.&nbsp; If the accused honestly believes there is no risk, this aspect of <i>mens rea</i> is not made out.&nbsp; In this kind of case, it is not a question of a defence that the accused "would win at the casinos and be able to pay his creditors", it is that in view of the accused's evidence, an essential element is not made out.&nbsp; This is the crucial distinction between this case and cases such as <i>R. v. Lemire</i>, [1965] S.C.R. 174, <i>Lafrance v. The Queen</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 201, and <i>Olan</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; If the <i>actus reus</i> has resulted in a deprivation or risk thereof, an intention to make good the loss or to remove the risk is not a defence.&nbsp; The offence is complete and a good intention will not save the accused.&nbsp; That is the situation in <i>Th√©roux</i>.&nbsp; The accused had subjected the deposits of his customers to a risk by his false representation.&nbsp; He did so knowingly, and his honest belief that the risk would not result in an eventual loss was to no avail.&nbsp; It is quite a different situation where, as here, in respect of the very activity relied on as creating the risk, the accused states that he honestly believed no risk was created.&nbsp; It remains to determine whether the statement by my colleague that the accused knew that his gambling would place the pecuniary interests of his creditors at risk is a finding made by the trial judge.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Most frauds continue to involve either deceit or falsehood.&nbsp; As is pointed out in <i>Th√©roux</i>, proof of deceit or falsehood is sufficient to establish the <i>actus reus</i> of fraud; no further proof of dishonest action is needed.&nbsp; However, the third category of "other fraudulent means" has been used to support convictions in a number of situations where deceit or falsehood cannot be shown.&nbsp; These situations include, to date, the use of corporate funds for personal purposes, non‚Äëdisclosure of important facts, exploiting the weakness of another, unauthorized diversion of funds, and unauthorized arrogation of funds or property:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Black and Whiteside</i> (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 313 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Shaw</i> (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 348 (N.B.C.A.);&nbsp; <i>R. v. Wagman</i> (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 23 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v.

D. Ewart, in his <i>Criminal Fraud</i> (1986), defines dishonest conduct as that "which ordinary, decent people would feel was discreditable as being clearly at variance with straightforward or honourable dealings" (p. 99).&nbsp; Negligence does not suffice.&nbsp; Nor does taking advantage of an opportunity to someone else's detriment, where that taking has not been occasioned by unscrupulous conduct, regardless of whether such conduct was wilful or reckless.&nbsp; The dishonesty of "other fraudulent means" has, at its heart, the wrongful use of something in which another person has an interest, in such a manner that this other's interest is extinguished or put at risk.&nbsp; A use is "wrongful" in this context if it constitutes conduct which reasonable decent persons would consider dishonest and unscrupulous.</span></p>

Geddes</i>, <i>supra</i>, a motorcycle dealer accepted money from a purchaser as advance payment on a particular type of motorcycle.&nbsp; After certain perfunctory efforts to obtain the desired motorcycle, the dealer deposited the money into his bank account, which was at the time overdrawn.&nbsp; The dealer immediately wrote cheques on this account to service his personal debts.&nbsp; The accused argued that he fully intended to carry through his undertaking to get the motorcycle, and failed only in because he was negligent in the operation of his business, in particular, in his expectation that he would shortly get a loan which would ultimately permit him to make good on his undertaking.&nbsp; The Manitoba Court of Appeal rejected this defence, emphasizing that there was nothing negligent or inadvertent in the dealer's use of the purchaser's money to satisfy his personal obligations.</span></p>

Currie</i>; <i>R. v. Bruce</i>, <i>supra</i>, dealt with a similar situation in the same fashion.&nbsp; The accused were in the business of investing funds in a certain company, "Water‚ÄëEze Products Ltd.", but diverted these funds without notice to the investors to an aviation company known as "Aerobec".&nbsp; There was no question of any misrepresentations.&nbsp; Nor was there any question as to what the accused were authorized to do with the funds given to them.&nbsp; The court, <i>per</i> Lacourci√®re J.A., found that the fact that the accused used the funds in a manner which was not authorized was sufficient grounds for finding that the accused acted dishonestly.</span></p>

Allsop</i> (1976), 64 Cr. App. R. 29; <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1963] 1 O.R. 249 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Knelson and Baran</i> (1962), 38 C.R. 181 (B.C.C.A.);&nbsp; <i>Welham v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1961] A.C. 103 (H.L.); <i>R. v. Melnyk</i> (1947), 90 C.C.C. 257 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Rodrigue, Ares and Nantel</i> (1973), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 252 (Que. C.A.), and <i>R. v. Huggett</i> (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 198 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp; What is essential is not the formalities of profit or actual pecuniary loss, but that dishonest commercial practices which subject the pecuniary interest of others to deprivation or the risk of deprivation be visited with the criminal sanction.&nbsp; It follows that the fact that the defrauder may have legal title to the property affords no defence; it is not his title, but how he has obtained it and what he does with it that is important.</span></p>
