margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B approached the first police force to provide information about violent crimes.&nbsp; He was promised informer privilege with respect to the information that he provided to that force.&nbsp; In its investigations, the SQ used confidential information B had given to the first police force prior to the SQ’s involvement. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on B’s information, the two police forces worked together and dealt with B interchangeably.&nbsp; An SQ officer acknowledged that the first police force and the SQ were effectively operating together in respect of an investigation that developed around B’s information.&nbsp; This interconnection is also reflected in a letter sent by an officer of the first police force, which acknowledges B’s confidentiality with the first force and implies that that force believed that B had a similar status with the SQ. </p>

margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that one police force has granted informer status to an individual is not, on its own, a sufficient basis for a claim of informer privilege with another police force.&nbsp; However, given the nexus between the forces in handling B, and given the essential continuity of B’s relationship with both, B may well have had reasonable grounds to believe that the protection promised by the first police force would continue with the ongoing flow of information that he was providing to the SQ.</p>

margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> Rothstein and Cromwell&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; To decide this case, the concrete realities of it and the limits of appellate review must first be assessed.&nbsp; The realities are that the application judge expressly rejected B’s evidence that his status as a confidential police informer was ever promised or even discussed.&nbsp; He further found that the police had done nothing that would permit B to understand that he was to become a confidential police informer.&nbsp; While it may in some rare cases be theoretically possible for a person to be both a Crown witness and a confidential police informer, it was not possible in B’s situation.&nbsp; The application judge recognized this as does B’s own counsel before this Court.&nbsp; The fact that the police have an obligation to protect a person has nothing to do with whether that person is a confidential police informer.&nbsp; Thus, there is nothing inconsistent with the police position that, on the one hand, they felt obliged to protect B and on the other, that B was not a confidential police informer. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any implication that B inquired about his status as a police informer and was not given a straight answer is not supported by either the application judge’s findings or by this record.&nbsp; In fact, the officers who testified on this issue repeatedly asserted that a conversation about B’s status as a source or confidential informer simply never occurred.&nbsp; Indeed, none of the officers involved failed to give B a straight answer about whether he was a confidential source because there were no such discussions.</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not open to an appellate court to reweigh the evidence in the record or to draw inferences from the evidence, which the application judge refused to draw, absent some clear and determinative error on the part of the judge.&nbsp; Thus, it is not open to this Court on appeal to draw any inference from this record that B inquired whether or not he was a source and did not receive a straight answer.&nbsp; Such an inference is not only contrary to the evidence that the application judge accepted but it is also contrary to the judge’s express finding of fact that the SQ did nothing that could have led B to believe that he would become a confidential police source. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of alleged police promises of confidentiality, the application judge was alive to and expressly noted that there was inconsistency in the evidence.&nbsp; A review of the record shows that there was indeed inconsistency or confusion in the evidence about what was or was not confidential.&nbsp; Sorting this out is the job of the application judge, not of an appellate court.&nbsp; The judge did so and there is no basis to interfere with his findings.</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application judge did not fail to consider whether a promise of confidential informer status could be implicit in this case.&nbsp; Rather, the judge’s factual findings and the record amply support the conclusion that he was careful to consider whether any promise was made implicitly as well as explicitly, even though B’s evidence was solely to the effect that the SQ had made repeated explicit promises.&nbsp; This was the only basis for his professed belief that he had informer status. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge was alive to B’s dealings with other police agencies.&nbsp; Having heard that evidence, however, he found as a fact that the evidence in the case required that B’s dealings with the SQ be considered differently.&nbsp; The judge referred to several differences in support of this conclusion, which is amply supported by the evidence. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the application judge’s extensive findings, there is no evidence to support the view that there may have been some implicit promise in this case.&nbsp; In fact, this possibility is inconsistent with B’s own clear and unequivocal evidence that the claim of informer privilege arose solely from alleged express promises, which the application judge concluded had never been made.&nbsp; Moreover, the judge accepted police evidence that there was never even any thought of making B a confidential informer and that they did nothing that could let B understand that he had that status.&nbsp; The judge also found that it was some years after B’s initial dealings with the SQ that B started to claim the status of a confidential police informer.&nbsp; These findings leave no room for the imputed or implied promise theory. </p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the judge’s conclusions that B actually knew that he did not have informer privilege and that B’s claim of that status was an after-the-fact exercise of opportunism make irrelevant any possibility that some hypothetical person in B’s circumstances might have thought that the promise was implicit.&nbsp; B knew he had no such promise and provided the information anyway.&nbsp; B was a disappointed suitor for a potentially lucrative co-operating witness contract and an opportunist, not a police informer.</p> 
   <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the record, there is no reason to interfere with the application judge’s findings of fact.&nbsp; Nothing in this case, however, should be taken as undermining the importance of the police being clear with potential sources about their status; quite the contrary.&nbsp; Given the important role that informer status plays in the detection and prosecution of crime, courts must not undermine its effectiveness by condoning police actions that leave potential informers uncertain or confused as to their status.&nbsp; The application judge in this case was clearly alive to these concerns, as he ought to have been, and reached the conclusions he did after a careful and thorough review of all of the evidence.&nbsp; His decision should not be disturbed. </p>

The second police force failed to answer B’s repeated questions about his status, nor did it at any time clarify what that status was.&nbsp; The disposition of this case rests on the consequences of the information vacuum created by the second police force and, in particular, on whether an inference could reasonably have been drawn that an implicit promise of confidentiality was made based on the nexus between the two police forces. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that B’s status as a confidential informant with one police force did not automatically make him a confidential informant for the other. The application judge also found that B lied about being expressly promised confidential informer status by the second police force. But the inquiry should not have ended there.&nbsp; What remained unanswered was whether, due to the interaction between the police forces and other police conduct, there was a nexus between the two police forces and, if so, whether B was implicitly promised that the confidentiality he enjoyed with one police force would continue to the other. The application judge accepted the testimony of officers in the second police force concerning their interactions with B. Significantly, that testimony included acknowledgments that B repeatedly asked what his status was, and was never clearly told that he was <i>not</i> a police informer.</p>

He never explained why. B placed himself at risk by providing the Sûreté du Québec (“SQ”) with information leading to the investigation and prosecution of violent crime.&nbsp; I see an error in the application judge’s failure to make <i>any</i> findings about whether the transfer, the relationship between the two police forces, and the similarities in B’s relationships with both, could have led someone in B’s position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that the status he had with the first police force would continue with the police force to which he was transferred.</p>

None of the application judge’s findings address them, even accepting all of the findings delineated by Justice Cromwell.

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN"><u>Background</u></p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Two days later, B was transferred to the SQ and two SQ officers arrested him for his crimes. B continued to want to cooperate and to give information both about his crimes and his prior criminal activities.&nbsp; In the next several days, B made a number of statements to the SQ relating to them.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B was given an informant code in the SQ’s system and, for five years, continued to cooperate with the SQ.&nbsp; Most<b> </b>of B’s declarations to the SQ were preceded by a statement promising him that the information he provided would not be used against him in a proceeding, except for perjury, but that charges could be brought against him if they were supported by independent evidence.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the course of those five years, B pleaded guilty to one of his violent crimes and was sentenced for it. </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, B testified that he was told by the SQ on several occasions that he was an informer.&nbsp; He relied on the fact that he was attributed an informant code by the SQ, that he was asked to sign a “Waiver of Informer Privilege”, and that he was identified as a “source” in any documents created after the Crown requested the general redaction.&nbsp; For its part, the Crown argued that the SQ expected B to become a cooperating witness; that B was told on many occasions that his statements could be used against him; that B’s identity was not concealed by the SQ in documents and statements prior to the sealing of the documents; and that the police had made limited disclosure of one of B’s statements on one occasion. The Crown suggested that this was inconsistent with B’s testimony<b> </b>that he had been promised that his identity would remain protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the first police force’s officers had promised to keep B’s identity confidential in exchange for the information he provided.&nbsp; All of B’s statements to that police force, therefore, were protected by informer privilege.&nbsp; This is not contested by any of the parties.</p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While he noted that it was <span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;font-variant:small-caps">[translation]</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%"> </span>“odd” that the police would ask a person to renounce his right to invoke police informer privilege if it had never been offered in the first place, the application judge nonetheless ultimately accepted the testimony of the Crown’s witnesses and found that B’s testimony was not credible.&nbsp; He therefore concluded that B had never been promised police informer status by the SQ in exchange for his statements. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the application judge undertook no analysis into whether the promise was implicit in the circumstances because of the nexus between the first police force, who had expressly granted B informer status, and the SQ, to whom the first force immediately transferred B because they lacked jurisdiction over the crimes he was describing. That oversight was based on the application judge’s conclusion that B’s relationships with the first police force and the SQ had to be treated differently.&nbsp; The application judge therefore ignored B’s relationship with the first force entirely when assessing his status <i>vis-à-vis </i>the SQ.&nbsp; </p>

Instead, his analysis unfolded based on this unexplored assumption.

   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT"><u>Analysis</u></p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Barros</i>, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 368, this Court held that “not everybody who provides information to the police thereby becomes a confidential informant” (para. 31).&nbsp; The Court was clear, however, that “the promise [of protection and confidentiality] need not be express [and] may be implicit in the circumstances” (para. 31, citing <i>Bisaillon v. Keable</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60). The legal question is whether, objectively, an implicit promise of confidentiality can be inferred from the circumstances.&nbsp; In other words, would the police conduct have led a person in the shoes of the potential informer to believe, on reasonable grounds, that his or her identity would be protected? Related to this, is there evidence from which it can reasonably be inferred that the potential informer believed that informer status was being or had been bestowed on him or her? An implicit promise of informer privilege may arise even if the police did not intend to confer that status or consider the person an informer, so long as the police conduct in all the circumstances could have created reasonable expectations of confidentiality.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge recognized that the promise of confidentiality could be either explicit or implicit, but he undertook no analysis into whether an implicit promise could have been inferred from the circumstances of the relationship between the two police forces. In fairness, a theory based on an implicit promise of confidentiality was not specifically argued before the application judge. The arguments before him centred on B’s claims that SQ officers had <i>expressly</i> and repeatedly told him that his identity would remain confidential, which the officers denied. Once the application judge found against B on that point, he effectively overlooked the possibility that the police conduct, even in the absence of any express statements, could have amounted to an implicit promise of confidentiality.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Cromwell states that there is no live issue as to whether B received an <i>implicit</i> promise of confidentiality<b>,</b> because the application judge effectively found that B <i>knew</i> that he did not have informant status with the SQ. With respect, those were not the application judge’s findings. I agree that if there had been a finding that B actually knew that he did not have informant status, the inquiry would end there. But there was no such finding. What the application judge did was to reject B’s claims that the SQ <i>expressly promised him</i> confidential informer status. He invoked B’s <span style="font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-variant:small-caps">[translation]</span> “doubtful credibility . . . and . . . obvious opportunism”. In other words, the application judge found that B lied in saying that the SQ officers expressly promised him confidentiality in order to bolster his claim. That does not, however, amount to a finding that B knew all along that he did not benefit from confidentiality with the SQ. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, B’s failure to testify about an implicit promise does not necessarily mean that no such promise was made or that he knew that informer status had been withheld. While B may have been found not to be credible about receiving <i>explicit</i> promises of confidentiality, the evidence in the record of a nexus between the police forces leaves open the possibility of an implicit promise. B’s “obvious opportunism” and lack of credibility do not, in the circumstances of this case, close the door to finding an <i>implicit</i> promise of confidentiality, nor do they dispense with the need for the application judge to examine the nexus between the investigations and determine whether it gave rise to such a promise.&nbsp; It is hard to speculate what the application judge’s findings <i>might have been</i> had he specifically turned his mind to the issue.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For me, the possibility of an implied promise of confidentiality emerges from this record based on the nexus between the first police force and the SQ, and the SQ’s failure to clarify to B what his status was. First, B’s interactions with the SQ originated in his relationship as a confidential informant with the first police force and the two police forces cooperated in handling B over the following years. In addition, the evidence is undisputed that no one ever told B that he <i>ceased</i> to be a confidential informant when he was transferred to the SQ, even though it is also undisputed that he repeatedly asked the SQ to clarify his status. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key issue is the nexus between the police forces. B advanced the argument that all police forces are “indivisible” with respect to police informer privilege such that, where one police force extends a promise of confidentiality to an informer, that status will continue to attach to the person when he or she is transferred to another force.&nbsp; I see no need for such a blunt “indivisibility” rule.&nbsp; The fact that one police force has granted informer status to an individual is not, on its own, a sufficient basis for a claim of informer privilege with another police force.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not to say that B’s transfer from one police force to another is irrelevant to whether B had reason to believe that he had been given informer privilege by the SQ. Given the interactions between the two police forces in handling B, and given the essential continuity of B’s relationship with both forces, in my view B may have had reasonable grounds to believe that the protection promised by the first police force would continue with the ongoing flow of information that he was providing to the SQ.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B approached the first police force in order to provide information about violent crimes. &nbsp;He was promised informer privilege with respect to the information that he provided to that force from their initial meeting onwards.&nbsp; One of the two officers who had been at that meeting explained that he perceived a strong need for confidentiality as of that first meeting, given the risk to B’s safety and the sensitive information he was providing concerning serious criminal activity:</p>

In other words, while it is true that the SQ arrested B for a violent crime that he committed, the SQ treated B as much more than merely a suspect in a serious crime. B was expected, and in fact continued to provide the SQ with information about violent criminal activity, just as he had done with the first police force. </p>

The officer asked the SQ to return the money to B because the only evidence that the money was the proceeds of crime was given by B to the SQ under a promise that it would not be used against him.

An SQ officer who had dealt with B since his arrest testified that around the time of his transfer to the SQ, B [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “was worried about what was going to happen to [him]”, and that he was “deeply concerned” about this.&nbsp; It was a source of stress for B, who was “extremely afraid” that he would be killed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another SQ officer testified that B was asking about his status two years after his transfer.

Where B’s status was in flux and unclear as a result of his transfer from one police force to another, the SQ’s failure to clarify his status may have given rise to a reasonable belief in informer status, whether or not he actually asked a specific question like, “Will I be treated as a police informer in the event of failure to conclude a cooperating witness contract?” </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[41]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fresh evidence also illustrates the ambiguity generated by the SQ’s approach to B’s status.<b> </b>Two documents introduced as fresh evidence were written by one of the SQ officers who had been involved with B since his transfer. These documents followed a discussion the SQ officer had two years after B’s arrest with an officer of the first police force about B’s status. In these documents, B was referred to as a “source”, as was the practice with informers, rather than by name. Many other documents prepared by SQ officers refer to B by his name. In other words, SQ officers inconsistently referred to B, sometimes designating him by his real name, and sometimes calling him an informer. Their confusion may well have led B to reasonably assume that his confidential status remained unchanged upon his transfer from the first police force to the SQ.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[42]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Cromwell concludes that B could not reasonably have believed that the SQ considered him an informer, given the expectation that he would become a cooperating witness. But informer privilege is not necessarily inconsistent with being a cooperating witness. B’s position at the hearing was that he believed he would remain a police informer until he secured a cooperating witness contract with the Crown. In other words, his identity would remain confidential until the Crown <i>confirmed </i>that it intended to call him as a witness and provide certain advantages in exchange for his testimony. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this Court recognized in <i>Barros</i>, the same person can be an informer entitled to privilege in one matter, and a witness whose identity is disclosable in another:</p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltC">Once a police informer goes into the “field” and acts as a police agent, the informer privilege is no longer applicable to prevent disclosure of his or her identity in respect of the events in which he or she acted as an agent. . . . <i>This does not mean, of course, that the informer loses protection in other cases where he or she has not stepped out of the protected role.</i> [Emphasis added; para. 33.]</p> 
   <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Witnesses can even testify without having to disclose that they supplied confidential information to the police in that same matter, as this Court noted in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Leipert</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281, at para. 17: “[Informer privilege] applies to a witness on the stand. Such a person cannot be compelled to state whether he or she is a police informer . . .”. This possibility has been recognized since <i>Attorney-General v. Briant </i>(1846), 15 M. &amp; W. 169, 153 E.R. 808, in which Pollock C.B. held that a Crown witness could not be asked, “Did you give the information?” that led to the institution of penal proceedings. Finally, while informers typically waive privilege when they agree to testify, nothing prevents them from keeping their privilege until there is a firm decision to testify by both the informer and the prosecution.</p>

One of the two SQ officers who arrested B explained to him that he would never have to testify in relation to any of the information he provided unless a cooperating witness contract was signed: </p>

The SQ did so without B’s knowledge or consent. The exceptional use of B’s statements a few years after the start of his relationship with the SQ is hardly revelatory of whether B could reasonably have believed that his identity was being protected throughout that time.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is true that B gave statements to the SQ after being cautioned that they could be used as evidence in court against third parties. But these cautions must be juxtaposed against the repeated reassurances from SQ officers that B’s statements would remain confidential, and that B would never have to testify on those subjects <i>unless and until</i> he became a cooperating witness. At the very least, the SQ sent mixed signals to B concerning the confidentiality of his statements, and never clearly denied that he benefitted from confidentiality. In my view, the net effect of these mixed signals from the SQ on B’s reasonable expectation of confidentiality must be decided at a new hearing. </p>

SQ officers repeatedly visited B for that purpose. Had there been certainty that B’s status was <i>not</i> protected, these steps would not have been necessary. The application judge acknowledged that the Crown’s request for a waiver of privilege was [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “contradictory” and “odd” given the SQ officers’ position that they had never promised B confidentiality, concluding: “Had the intention been to confuse, it could not have been done better.” </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague Abella J. would hold that the application judge’s ruling must be set aside and the matter reheard, essentially for two reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the application judge “undertook no analysis” into whether the promise of confidential informer status was implicit in the circumstances (paras. 15 and 19).&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, this issue which the application judge failed to consider is a live issue on this record because there is evidence, including new evidence, to support the conclusion that “the police conduct [would] have led someone in B’s position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that [his status was] protected” (para. 16). The failure to consider this live issue therefore requires a new hearing.&nbsp; I cannot subscribe to my colleague’s conclusion or the reasons for it.&nbsp; My disagreement is based on the following interrelated points.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the analysis of the appeal in my view must take place in the context of the concrete realities of this case and within the proper limits of appellate review. Respectfully, my colleague’s analysis is directed towards hypothetical possibilities that are either contrary to clear findings by the application judge or have no air of reality on the record before the Court. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the application judge, as I see it, did not fail to consider whether a promise of confidential informer status could be implicit in this case.&nbsp; In my view, the judge’s factual findings and the record amply support the conclusion that he considered that possibility.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, as I read the record in light of the application judge’s extensive findings, there is no evidence to support the view that there may have been some implicit promise in this case.&nbsp; In fact, this possibility is inconsistent with B’s own evidence and with the circumstances under which B was treated by the SQ. Moreover, the application judge specifically considered whether an implicit promise had been made and made explicit findings of fact that the <i>SQ never did anything that could allow B to understand that he would become a confidential police informer</i>.&nbsp; As I see it there is no live issue on this point.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the application judge found as a fact that B <i>actually knew</i> from his first dealings, and during his subsequent dealings, with the SQ that he had no promise that he would be a confidential source for the SQ and that the claim of informer status was an after-the-fact exercise in opportunism on B’s part.&nbsp; This conclusion, amply supported by the record, makes irrelevant what some hypothetical person in B’s position might have thought.&nbsp; B thought no such thing and, knowing he did not have any promise of confidentiality, supplied information to the SQ for a number of years.&nbsp; As the application judge found, B’s assertion of informer privilege came only when the Crown, in the context of discharging disclosure obligations in another prosecution, thought it advisable to have B’s status clarified by a judicial determination.&nbsp; The judge dismissed B’s after-the-fact claims as showing [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “obvious opportunism” on his part. </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[75]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SQ later informed B that there was a possibility that B would be offered a co-operating witness contract nonetheless.&nbsp; The appellant accepted the police’s offer and a co-operative relationship between the SQ and the appellant was re-established.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[76]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After B resumed active co-operation with the SQ, he later gave several statements to the SQ.&nbsp; It is worth noting here that though it was made clear to the appellant that these statements could not be used against <i>him</i> in a court of law, it was also made clear that they could be used as evidence <i>in the trials of third parties</i>. As I shall discuss and the application judge rightly found, in these circumstances, the roles of potential witness and police informer were completely inconsistent, as B would well have understood.&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:-58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Non-completion of the Co-operating Witness Contract</u></p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few weeks later, the appellant contacted the SQ, seeking assurances about the progress of his co-operating witness application.&nbsp; The appellant testified that he was told by an SQ officer, with another officer present, that his contract was forthcoming and that, in any event, he was considered a confidential police informer in the meantime.&nbsp; Again, this is denied by the SQ. The officer, on the other hand, claims only to have told him that he wanted him to testify in court, and assured him that he was taking care of him and his safety.&nbsp; According to the officer, the option of granting the appellant confidential informer status was never contemplated because he was always sure that the appellant would be given a co-operating witness contract.&nbsp; As noted earlier, the application judge accepted the police evidence.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is uncontested, however, is that the evaluation process was progressing.&nbsp; Officers took the appellant to other SQ-controlled premises later that same year, where he made full disclosure of his criminal past — a prerequisite to the signature of a co-operating witness contract.&nbsp; He also met with Crown prosecutors a few days later.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few months later, the appellant was questioned again with the assurance that his statements would not be used against him in a court of law.&nbsp; He was questioned regarding several inconsistencies between different statements he had made to the police and to Crown prosecutors.&nbsp; It is clear that his credibility was being tested, as is often done when evaluating the suitability of a co-operating witness candidate and his potential for providing convincing testimony in court.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Crown ultimately decided against entering into the arrangement because it did not intend to have him testify for the moment.&nbsp; He would therefore not be retained as a co-operating witness.&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chief among its concerns was its desire to clarify whether or not the appellant benefited from informer privilege, for if he did, much of his statements even if otherwise subject to disclosure would not be so subject.&nbsp; In an effort to clear up this issue, the Crown sent a police officer to meet with the appellant and ask him whether he would agree to sign a document whereby he would undertake not to seek to invoke informer privilege regarding the information he had provided the SQ.&nbsp; The appellant refused.&nbsp; The Crown therefore brought a motion before the court seeking to determine whether or not the appellant benefited from informer privilege.&nbsp; After witness testimony and argument by counsel, the judge held that B did not benefit from informer privilege in regard to that information.&nbsp; </p>

(3d) 465, the application judge held that in order for informer privilege to apply, the police had to explicitly or implicitly promise a claimant that his identity as the provider of information would be kept confidential.&nbsp; He added that the burden rested on the individual claiming informer privilege to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he was entitled to benefit from it.&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also called several SQ officers to testify in that regard.&nbsp; They all indicated that the appellant had never been considered a confidential informer and had never been told so.&nbsp; In fact, they indicated that they always had in mind that B was in the process of becoming a co-operating witness and would testify in future court proceedings.&nbsp; The prospect of granting B informer privilege had, according to them, simply never been on their radar.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After having considered the testimonial and documentary evidence before him, the application judge proceeded to identify the elements which supported the parties’ respective positions.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of the appellant’s position, the application judge noted the fact that the SQ in some respects treated B as it would a confidential informer and had invited him to sign a document whereby he would undertake not to seek to invoke informer privilege regarding the information he had provided the SQ.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of the opposite conclusion, the application judge noted, amongst other things, that (1) the appellant wished to become a police agent and expected to have to testify in future trials, (2) B was arrested for violent criminal activity and the information that he gave the SQ in that regard was used against B, (3) B gave a statement soon after his first meeting with the SQ knowing that this could lead to charges of violent criminal activity, (4) the SQ never produced any source reports regarding the information gathered from him, (5) B was offered immunity and an undertaking not to testify in a prosecution, (6) one of the appellant’s statements was disclosed in the course of another investigation (this is incompatible with the confidentiality owed to an individual benefiting from informer privilege), and that (7) the appellant gave several statements in regards of which he was warned they could be used as evidence in the trial of others.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having completed this exercise, the application judge acknowledged that it was certainly surprising to [<span style="font-variant:
small-caps">translation</span>] “ask someone considered to be a possible witness to waive [his] police informer privilege [some] years after having assigned [him] an identifier reserved for sources”.&nbsp; He also found quite strange that the Crown asked the appellant to undertake not to seek to invoke a privilege that only the SQ police officers could have granted and that they maintained never having granted.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[92]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the application judge remained of the view that no express or implied understanding existed between the SQ and the appellant that he would be conferred confidential informer status. Contrary to Justice Abella’s suggestion that the key question of whether there was an implicit promise of confidentiality was left unanswered, this question was in fact specifically answered in the negative by the application judge.&nbsp; Recognizing that the evidence was contradictory, he largely rejected the appellant’s testimony as lacking credibility, and instead accepted the evidence of the SQ officers.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[93]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge further found that the appellant had <i>always</i>, since his first meeting with the SQ, understood that he would testify in other trials.&nbsp; B’s insistence on obtaining confidential informer status was sparked, the application judge found, by disappointment with not being signed on as a co-operating witness and the fruitlessness of the negotiations with the witness protection programme. The application judge was of the view that the appellant seized the opportunity of trying to invoke informer privilege when the Crown tried to obtain an undertaking not to seek to invoke informer privilege; on account of this, the appellant’s behaviour, the application judge opined, was that of an obvious opportunist.&nbsp; Considering this express finding that B only sought to assert privilege after the fact, it is my view that we can conclude that, contrary to my colleague’s statement at para. 20, this <i>does</i> “amount to a finding that B knew all along that he did not benefit from confidentiality with the SQ”. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[94]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With all that having been said, the application judge concluded that an analysis of the testimonies and the exhibits leads to the overriding conclusion that the appellant did not benefit from informer privilege in regard to the information provided to the SQ, but was rather a compellable witness in the trial of other individuals. The judge further found that the SQ had never done anything that would allow B to understand that he would become a confidential police informer.</p>

He further found that the police had done nothing that would permit B to understand that he was to become a confidential police informer.

The application judge recognized this as indeed does B’s own counsel before this Court. Moreover, the application judge specifically rejected as a matter of fact B’s evidence that he was promised confidential informer status pending the resolution of the co-operating witness process and accepted the police evidence that they did nothing that could have led B to understand that he had confidential police informer status at any point in their dealings.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[98]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the fact that the police have an obligation to protect a person has nothing to do with whether that person is a confidential police informer. There is nothing inconsistent with the police position that, on the one hand, they felt obliged to protect B, and on the other that B was not a confidential police informer.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[99]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, it is not open to an appellate court to reweigh the evidence in the record or to draw inferences from the evidence which the application judge refused to draw absent some clear and determinative error on the part of the application judge. In my respectful view, my colleague Abella J.’s reasons run afoul of this important principle in more than one respect.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[100]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider, for example, my colleague’s repeated references to B’s inquiries concerning his “status”.&nbsp; In effect, my colleague suggests that B asked repeatedly about whether he was a police informer and was not given a straight answer.&nbsp; Respectfully, that is not an inference that may be fairly drawn from this record or the application judge’s findings of fact. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[101]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B’s testimony that he was assured that he had the status of a confidential police informer pending the outcome of the co-operating witness contract process was specifically rejected by the application judge. On the contrary, the judge found expressly that the police, since B’s first meeting with the SQ, had <i>always manifested the intention to call B to testify</i> publicly about his revelations to them and that <i>their discussions with him never allowed him to understand that he could become a confidential source</i>. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[102]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the police witnesses, whose evidence the judge accepted, B’s preoccupation was with getting a co-operating witness contract — a contract that he could reasonably expect would provide financial and other benefits.&nbsp; It was about the progress of the process of being given such a contract, not whether B was a confidential informer, that B repeatedly inquired and in response to which the police advised that the process was ongoing and that the Crown had the final decision.&nbsp; Any implication that B inquired about his status as a police informer and was not given a straight answer is, respectfully, not supported by either the application judge’s findings or by this record. In fact, the officers who testified on this issue repeatedly asserted that a conversation about B’s status as a “source” or “confidential informer” <i>simply never occurred</i>. For example, an officer testified in the following manner:</p>

   <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">In other words, none of the officers involved failed to give B a straight answer about whether he was a confidential source because there were no such discussions and the very idea of B being or becoming a source never even crossed their minds. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[103]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is not open to this Court on appeal to draw any inference from this record that B inquired whether or not he was a “source” and did not receive a straight answer.<b> </b>Such an inference is not only contrary to the evidence which the application judge accepted but it is also contrary to the judge’s express finding of fact that the SQ did nothing that could have led B to believe that he would become a confidential police source.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[104]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague also, in my respectful view, oversteps the bounds of appellate review with respect to the issue of alleged police promises of confidentiality. On this, the application judge was alive to and expressly noted that there was a lack of clarity and consistency in the evidence. A review of the record shows that there were indeed some inconsistencies in the police evidence on this issue and that the term “confidential” was used in several different senses. The judge even interjected during the testimony of an officer in order to clarify the sense in which the officer was using the term confidential. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The apparent confusion about what was or was not confidential is evident in the police testimony. For example, an officer — in the passage cited by my colleague Abella J. at para. 44 — states that if B does not sign a contract, he will not have to testify and his statements will not be used against him, implying a certain level of confidentiality. Later, however, he testified to having on one occasion acted in a way that was inconsistent with B being a confidential source and insisted that B is not a “source” because with a “source” you cannot divulge his identity.&nbsp; Similarly, another officer is inconsistent in his testimony about confidentiality. While in the passage cited by my colleague at para. 45, the officer states that B’s statements were “always confidential”, he also testifies to the fact that B was never a police informer nor a confidential “source”.&nbsp; On the other hand, the evidence of another officer consistently contrasts B’s situation with that of a police informer — whose identity and statements must be kept secret — and states that there was no confidentiality. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sorting this out was the job of the application judge, not of an appellate court.&nbsp; The judge adverted to this issue (among others) and made findings that the evidence showed that B in this case could not be at the same time a police informer and prosecution witness, that the police had consistently manifested the intention to call B as a witness and that the police had never let B understand that he would become a confidential police informer. There is in my view no basis to interfere with these clear findings.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[107]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With those matters in mind, I turn to the remaining issues.</p>

line-height:normal">B.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the Application Judge Fail to Consider Whether a Promise of Confidential Informer Status Could Be Implicit in This Case?</i></p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge was alive to B’s dealings with other police agencies.&nbsp; Having heard that evidence, however, he found as a fact that the evidence in the case required that B’s dealings with the SQ be considered differently.&nbsp; The judge referred to several differences in support of this conclusion, which is amply supported by the evidence. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B had contacted the police for the purpose of providing them with information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the initial encounter with the SQ, B was taken into custody and arrested for his crime.&nbsp; As I have reviewed above, B made a number of statements.&nbsp; While in some cases, B was promised that the statements would not be used as evidence against B, in many cases it was made perfectly clear to B, and B clearly understood, that they could be used as evidence in court <i>against others</i>. &nbsp;That use of B’s statements, of course, is completely inconsistent with any notion that B’s identity as the supplier of that information would remain confidential.&nbsp; In short, the dealings with the SQ consisted of plea bargaining and protracted negotiations of a possible co-operating witness contract, which contemplated B testifying for the Crown in public trials.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These considerations lead me to the view that the application judge did not fail to consider whether a promise of confidential informer status could be implicit.&nbsp; Rather, the judge was careful to consider whether any promise was made <i>implicitly</i> as well as explicitly, even though B’s evidence was solely to the effect that the SQ had made repeated explicit promises. This was the <i>sole</i> basis for his professed belief that he had informer status. In any event, as I will discuss in the next section, the existence of a supposed “implicit promise” was never a live issue on this record. </p>

In short, the application judge disbelieved the bulk of the appellant’s version of facts, including his allegation that an explicit promise had been made to him.&nbsp; Significantly, the appellant does not contest the application judge’s devastating findings of credibility regarding his testimony. </p>

The judge also found that it was some years after B’s initial dealings with the SQ that B started to claim the status of a confidential police informer. These findings leave no room for the imputed or implied promise theory.&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[126]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, even had he had such an expectation, this expectation as well as any belief that the police had acted on it and guaranteed him confidentiality would have been unreasonable.&nbsp; Indeed, the very fact that he was cautioned several times that his statements could at the very least be entered into evidence against others in public trials is fundamentally incompatible with an expectation or belief in a guarantee of confidentiality.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[127]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague Abella J. mentions several elements which she believes support her position that the appellant could have believed, on reasonable grounds, that he benefited from informer privilege.&nbsp; Respectfully, I find none to be persuasive.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[128]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he was formally charged and cautioned, he would have known that everything he said from that point on could be used as evidence in a court of law.&nbsp; Being treated in that fashion by the police is absolutely incompatible with any notion that it would have somehow led someone to believe that his or her identity as the purveyor of statements to them would be kept confidential.&nbsp; B of course would have fully understood this.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[129]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;I have already discussed my colleague’s suggestion that B repeatedly asked the SQ about his status and did not receive a straight answer.&nbsp; Neither the application judge’s conclusions nor the record permit any such inference to be drawn.&nbsp; I have also referred to the police evidence about confidentiality; the application judge considered this evidence and found that the SQ had done nothing that would allow B to infer that he was a confidential police informer.&nbsp; My colleague also places weight on some documents to support the possibility that B thought he had been implicitly promised confidential source status.&nbsp; The reason that this cannot be so, however, is that there is no evidence that B was even aware of them.&nbsp; The documents could therefore not bear on his belief.&nbsp; The police officers who were in a position to provide the appellant with confidential informer status testified that they never had in mind to make the appellant a confidential informer.&nbsp; The only “status” he had with the SQ, in their mind, was that of an individual in the process of becoming a co-operating witness.&nbsp; This testimony was accepted by the application judge.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[130]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague points to the fact that the appellant was referred to as a source in two documents while having been named in many others. My colleague concludes that this inconsistent treatment of B may have led B to reasonably assume that he had confidential status with the SQ. Respectfully, this is not an inference that is open on this record.&nbsp; B never suggested any such thing during his extensive testimony.&nbsp; Moreover, there is no evidence that this fact was known by the appellant at the relevant time and it therefore cannot have given rise to any implied promise in the appellant’s mind.&nbsp; If this evidence is seen as undermining the SQ’s evidence that it never considered giving B confidential source status, that use is directly contrary to clear findings of fact by the application judge.&nbsp; Finally, the evidence is inconsequential placed in the correct factual context.&nbsp; The appellant is referred to by name in many documents and this is incompatible with the police having an actual desire to keep his identity confidential.&nbsp; The evidence of the documents provides no basis to set aside the application judge’s finding of fact that the SQ did not ever treat B as a confidential source.&nbsp; The fact that B was not aware of any of this at the time of course means that this could not have given rise to any implied promise of confidentiality.&nbsp; </p>

This point was fully considered by the application judge and rejected.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[132]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude, I am of the view that the implicit promise of confidentiality was never a live issue on this record.&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[133]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge in effect found that B <i>actually knew</i> that his identity was not protected with respect to the information given to the SQ. My colleague maintains that there was no such finding, but I respectfully disagree.&nbsp; This finding, in my view, is supported by the evidence and fatal to the suggestion that there could be some implied understanding to the contrary.&nbsp; To develop this point, I must touch first on some principles of the law about confidential informers and then return to examine the application judge’s findings.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[134]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The traditional view is that informer privilege has “contract-like” elements of offer and acceptance.&nbsp; The privilege arises where a police officer promises protection and confidentiality to a prospective informer in exchange for information.&nbsp; In a clear case, confidentiality is explicitly sought and agreed to: <i>&nbsp;R. v. Barros</i>, 2011 SCC 51, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 368, at paras. 31-32;<i> R. v. Basi</i>, 2009 SCC 52, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 389, at para. 36.&nbsp; This promise may be express or implied:<i> Bisaillon</i>,<i> </i>at p. 105. While the subjective intent of the police may be relevant to assessing the evidence, subjective intent on their part to confer the privilege is not a necessary element of the test for whether the privilege has been conferred.&nbsp; All of the leading cases from this Court put this rule on this “contract-like” basis.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[135]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore agree with my colleague Abella J. when she says that the test for whether there was an implicit promise of confidentiality in this case is whether the police conduct would have led someone in B’s position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that such a promise had been made in exchange for the information provided.&nbsp; There is thus both a subjective and an objective element:&nbsp; the alleged source must in fact believe that confidentiality was promised in exchange for the information and that belief must be reasonable, judged from the point of view of a reasonable person in the alleged source’s position.&nbsp; If there is such a belief and it is reasonable, an implicit promise has been established.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[136]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that appellant’s counsel in this Court agrees that the alleged source must believe that the protection has been accorded. As appellant’s counsel put it, [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “B’s belief and perception as to his status as an informer is of prime importance”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[137]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I emphasize this fundamental point because I am respectfully of the view that my colleague has lost sight of it in her analysis.&nbsp; My colleague spends much effort in trying to demonstrate that if B had believed that he had been promised confidentiality, that belief would have been reasonable.&nbsp; I of course do not accept that contention.&nbsp; But be that as it may, the reasonableness of the belief of some hypothetical person in B’s situation is not sufficient to establish the existence of the privilege unless B also established that he actually believed that the implicit promise had been made. There can be no such finding here and that is fatal to B’s claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[138]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I repeat that B’s position in his extensive testimony was never that there was some sort of implicit promise. B’s alleged belief was based solely on alleged express — and repeated — promises of being given confidential informer status.&nbsp; There is no basis in fact to support the conclusion that B in fact believed that he was an informer. Quite the contrary.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[139]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge correctly noted that the evidence showed that in the circumstances of this case, <i>B could not be at the same time a prosecution witness and a police informer</i> with respect to the information given to the SQ.&nbsp; The application judge also proceeded on the basis that in the circumstances here, this would have been clear to B.&nbsp; The application judge makes repeated reference to B’s knowledge that he would be a witness and to the cautions which he had heard and signed that made this explicit.&nbsp; This approach cannot be faulted and accords with the evidence.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[140]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as I am aware, there is no hard and fast rule that a confidential informer cannot become a witness to testify regarding the very information he provided to police in confidence.&nbsp; However, as a practical matter, such situations would be extremely rare.&nbsp; It is hard to see how an informer could testify about certain things without making it obvious that he was a source of the police knowledge about those things.&nbsp; In other words, such testimony could only rarely if at all be given without creating a risk that the informer’s identity as the purveyor of the privileged information would be discovered, an outcome, I would emphasize, the Crown is under a legal obligation to do all in its power to avoid.&nbsp; As a practical matter, unless both the Crown <i>and</i> the witness agree to renounce it, informer privilege must be seen as barring, for all practical purposes, the Crown from calling an informer to testify at trial about the very information provided to the police in confidence.&nbsp; The two roles are almost invariably incompatible.&nbsp; Of course, a potential witness would fully understand this as it will generally be obvious that the testimony will reveal the source of the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; The application judge, as noted, concluded that this was the situation in this case. It is also important to remember that the application judge specifically rejected B’s evidence that B was expressly promised the status of confidential informer pending the decision about the possible co-operating witness contract.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[141]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking all of the evidence into account, the judge concluded that B knew he was to be a witness in relation to the information that he provided to the SQ and this necessarily required B to know that he was not a confidential informer.&nbsp; Moreover, and perhaps even more significantly, the judge found that it was only some years after B’s first dealings with the SQ and his being told that his evidence would not for the moment be required that B’s behaviour gradually changed. The judge also found that it was only after B was requested to sign the renunciation of any intention to claim informer privilege and the unsuccessful negotiations with the witness protection service that he asserted confidential informer status.&nbsp; In short, the judge concluded that B knew all along that he had no informer protection and that B’s assertion to the contrary was an after-the-fact exercise of obvious opportunism.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[142]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, these clear and strong findings are supported by a mountain of evidence, not the least of which is that B in his testimony before the judge at no time suggested that his belief that informer protection had been accorded depended on anything other than express promises by members of the SQ to that effect.&nbsp; The judge found, of course, that there were no such express promises and indeed that the SQ officers did nothing that would let B understand that any such promise was being made.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[143]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge’s conclusions that B actually knew that he did not have informer privilege and that B’s claim of that status was an after-the-fact exercise of opportunism make irrelevant any possibility that some hypothetical person in B’s circumstances might have thought that the promise was implicit.&nbsp; B knew he had no such promise and provided the information anyway.&nbsp; B was a disappointed suitor for a potentially lucrative co-operating witness contract and an opportunist, not a police informer.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[144]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude on this point, B never claimed to have a subjective belief that he had been promised confidentiality in exchange for the information provided to the SQ on any basis other than express promises. In light of the application judge’s findings, there is no evidence to support the view that B in fact had any such subjective belief on any basis. This, to my way of thinking, makes irrelevant what some hypothetical person in B’s position might reasonably have believed.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[145]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the record and the findings of fact of the application judge in this case, there is, in my view, no reason to interfere with the application ruling. However, I would underline that I share the application judge’s view that the police and the prosecution could have handled this matter in a more satisfactory manner. Nothing that I have said, therefore, should be taken as undermining the importance of the police being clear with potential sources about their status; quite the contrary. </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[146]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police informer status plays an important role in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. As this Court noted in <i>Leipert</i>, at para. 10, “[t]he rule is of fundamental importance to the workings of a criminal justice system”. In order for it to be effective, the protection provided to police informers must be virtually inviolable, subject only to the narrow innocence at stake exception. Indeed this Court has previously described the privilege as “absolute”: <i>Vancouver Sun</i>, at para. 4.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[147]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the police and the public at large benefit from the existence of this privilege because it encourages people to come forward to assist in police investigations:</p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police work, and the criminal justice system as a whole, depend to some degree on the work of confidential informers.&nbsp; The law has therefore long recognized that those who choose to act as confidential informers must be protected from the possibility of retribution.&nbsp; The law’s protection has been provided in the form of the informer privilege rule, which protects from revelation in public or in court of the identity of those who give information related to criminal matters in confidence.&nbsp; This protection in turn encourages cooperation with the criminal justice system for future potential informers. </p> 
   <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:13.7pt">&nbsp;</p>

Police actions which amount to deliberate attempts to confuse a person about his status, or even inadvertent actions that have the same effect, reduce confidence in the protection provided by informer privilege. That reduced confidence discourages people with information about criminal activity from reporting to the police, which erodes a powerful investigative avenue. </p>

   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[151]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Other Individuals submit that the application judge did not follow the principles established in <i>Basi </i>and therefore disregarded their rights to full answer and defence.&nbsp; However, as I find that the appellant does not benefit from informer privilege, the Other Individuals would be entitled to whatever relevant discloseable evidence came out of the SQ’s dealings with the appellant.&nbsp; It follows that any procedural failings on the part of the application judge, if there were such, did not in the end prejudice the Other Individuals.&nbsp; </p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN">F.<i>&nbsp; Would Any Privilege Have Been Lost Through Disclosure of B’s Identity?</i></p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[152]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Other Individuals submit that even if the privilege arose, it would have been lost through disclosure of B’s identity.&nbsp;&nbsp; As in my view, the privilege did not arise, I do not have to address this issue. I simply note that it seems to me that this issue would have to be decided if one were of the view that the privilege may have indeed arisen.</p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN">IV.&nbsp; <u>Disposition</u></p> 
   <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[153]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal with no order as to costs.&nbsp; </p>
