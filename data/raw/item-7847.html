text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">On September&nbsp;5, 2002, a computer technician arrived unannounced at the accused’s house to install a high‑speed Internet connection the accused had ordered.&nbsp; The accused lived with his wife and two children, aged three and seven, but was alone that day with his younger daughter.&nbsp; When the technician opened the accused’s Web browser, he noticed several links to both adult and child pornography sites in the taskbar’s “favourites” list, including two that were labelled “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX”.&nbsp; He also saw a legal pornographic image, but he could not remember afterwards if it was on the browser’s home page or on the computer desktop.&nbsp; In the room, he noticed home videos and, on a tripod, a webcam that was connected to a videotape recorder and was pointed at the toys and at the child.&nbsp; Unable to finish his work on that day, the technician returned the following morning and noted that everything had been “cleaned up”:&nbsp; the child’s toys had been placed in a box, the videotapes could no longer be seen, the webcam was pointed at the computer user’s chair and the computer hard drive had been “formatted”.&nbsp; In November, concerned with the child’s safety, the technician reported what he had seen to a social worker, who contacted the RCMP.&nbsp; The technician made a statement to Cst.&nbsp; O in January&nbsp;8, 2003.&nbsp; After the interview, O consulted Cpl. B from the RCMP’s Technological Crime Unit, who he knew had experience investigating crimes involving computers and technological devices.&nbsp; B stated that these types of offenders were habitual and would continue their computer practices with child pornography and that this information would remain inside the hard drive of the computer.&nbsp; O also spoke to Cst. H who, he had been told by a Crown attorney, had experience investigating child exploitation offences.&nbsp; H informed O&nbsp; that these offenders treasured collections on their computers and liked to store them and create backups.&nbsp; O also verified whether an active Internet connection was still being provided to the accused’s residence.&nbsp; He then drafted an information to obtain a search warrant (“ITO”) and, on January 10, a warrant was issued pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec487" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;487<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> to search the accused’s computer.&nbsp; Pornographic pictures involving children were found on the computer and the accused was charged with possession of child pornography contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec163.1subsec4" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;163.1(4)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; At trial, he unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the search warrant under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</i>&nbsp; The trial judge convicted the accused and the majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction.</p>

In order to commit the offence of possession, as opposed to the offence of accessing of child pornography, one must knowingly acquire the underlying data files and store them in a place under one’s control.&nbsp; It is the underlying data file that is the stable “object” that can be transferred, stored, and possessed.&nbsp; The automatic caching of a file to the hard drive does not, without more, constitute possession.&nbsp; While the cached file might be in a “place” over which the computer user has control, in order to establish possession it must be shown that the file was knowingly stored and retained through the cache.&nbsp;&nbsp; An ITO seeking a warrant to search for evidence of possession, rather than accessing, must therefore provide reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged offender possesses (or has possessed) digital files of an illegal image, and that evidence of that possession will be found in the place to be searched at the time the warrant is sought.&nbsp; Here, the search and seizure of the accused’s computer infringed his right under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Even when corrected and amplified on review, the ITO was insufficient to permit any justice of the peace, acting reasonably, to find adequate grounds for the search.&nbsp; The ITO did not allege the distinct and separate offence of accessing child pornography and, stripped of its defects and deficiencies, all that really remained were two Internet links, seen four months earlier in the “Favourites” menu of a Web browser on a computer that was subsequently formatted, deleting both links. The prior presence of the two “Lolita” links supports a reasonable inference that the accused browsed a Web site that contained explicit images of females under the age of 18, but this does not suffice to establish possession.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The misleading passages in the ITO that suggested that the technician had actually viewed illegal pornography on the computer, rather than suspiciously labelled “favourites”, must be excised. That pornographic images of children were actually seen on the computer is an entirely false claim. Aside from false statements, the ITO in several places gave an incomplete and misleading account of the facts, in contravention of the informant’s duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material information.&nbsp; The ITO does not mention, as the <i>voir dire</i> revealed, that the two “favourites” were “just scattered through the favourites” among additional links pointing to “regular adult material”.&nbsp; The failure to mention these facts creates a misleading impression.&nbsp; Once it is understood that the suspicious “Favourites” were in fact exceptions, found together with much more material that was undisputedly legal, the inference that the accused possessed illegal images becomes significantly less compelling.&nbsp; Furthermore, the descriptions of the webcam and its placement are juxtaposed immediately alongside the descriptions of the suspicious “Favourites” and the technician’s claims that he had “observed ‘Lolita Porn’”, clearly suggesting that the accused might have been making (and possessing) his own illegal pornography.&nbsp; The ITO, however, did not include a number of additional facts known to the police.&nbsp; First, the three‑year‑old child mentioned, but not identified, in the ITO was in fact the accused’s daughter.&nbsp; Second, the ITO stated that the accused was alone in the house with the girl, but failed to mention that his wife lived with them.&nbsp; Third, the ITO also failed to mention that the child was fully clothed, that there was no evidence of abuse, that the computer room had a child gate and appeared to double as a playroom for the child, and that the child was playing with the scattered toys in the middle of the room when the technician arrived.&nbsp; While the reviewing judge found no deliberate attempt to mislead, it is nonetheless evident that the police officer’s selective presentation of the facts painted a less objective and more villainous picture than the picture that would have emerged had he disclosed all the material information available to him at the time.&nbsp; It seems much more plausible that the accused was simply using the VCR and webcam to videotape his young daughter at play for posterity’s sake, rather than for any purpose connected to child pornography.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">To conclude that evidence of possession would be found four months after the hard drive was erased, one must accept either that the accused had made external copies of illegal images present in the computer before formatting its hard drive or that he acquired additional illegal images after the formatting.&nbsp; While the ITO seeks to establish inferences based on the likely behaviour of the accused on the basis of generalizations made by B and H about the propensities of certain “types of offenders” to hoard and copy illegal images, the ITO does not establish either the veracity of the generalization about the alleged “type of offender”, or that the accused is in fact the “type” to which the generalization might have applied. The ITO contains no evidentiary material in this regard apart from the bald assertion of the two police officers and there is virtually nothing to describe, let alone establish, the expertise of the officers.&nbsp; Moreover, the class of persons to whom specific proclivities are attributed is defined so loosely as to bear no real significance. &nbsp;There is no reason to believe, on the basis of the information in the ITO as amplified, that all child pornography offenders engage in hoarding, storing, sorting, and categorizing activity.&nbsp; To permit reliance on broad generalizations about loosely defined classes of people is to invite dependence on stereotypes and prejudices in lieu of evidence.&nbsp; It is not the role of courts to establish by judicial fiat broad generalizations regarding the “proclivities” of certain “types” of people, including offenders.&nbsp; Matters of this sort are best left to be established by the Crown, according to the relevant standard — in this case, reasonable grounds for belief.&nbsp; Here, two suspiciously labelled links in the “Favourites” do not suffice to characterize a person as an habitual child pornography offender of the type that seeks out and hoards illegal images.&nbsp; The fact that the bulk of the pornographic material that the technician observed at the accused’s house was legal adult pornography suggests that the accused did not have a “pronounced” interest in child pornography.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">The presence of the webcam, which was functioning as a camcorder recording to a VCR, has only a tenuous relation to the crime alleged.&nbsp; While it may be true that the accused was adept at recording videotapes and storing the tapes for future use — as is nearly everyone who owns a camcorder — this says nothing about his propensity to store a different kind of image (child pornography), in a different medium (a computer, as opposed to videotape), acquired in a different manner (downloading, as opposed to filming).&nbsp; To draw an inference that he is of the type to hoard illegal images is to speculate impermissibly.&nbsp; Nor does the accused’s conduct after the technician’s visit support the conclusion that he was the sort of person to seek out and hoard child pornography.&nbsp; The accused might well have tidied up the room and formatted his computer simply to avoid further embarrassment from having an outsider see the disorderly state of his home and the evidence of his consumption of pornography on his computer.&nbsp; The accused’s conduct might raise suspicions but, as a matter of law, mere suspicion is no substitute for reasonable grounds.</p>

It appears from the record that after she interviewed A.Y. and members of her family, Det. Const. Pulkki suspected that the appellant was a pedophile, which led her to further suspect that he might possess items of child pornography. To be fair to her, she realized that her suspicion was insufficient to enable her to obtain a warrant. She was aware that it was necessary that she have reasonable grounds to believe that child pornography would be located in the appellant’s home. She sought the opinion of Dr. Collins in the hope that it would tip the scales from suspicion to reasonable grounds. As the trial judge recognized, the opinion of Dr. Collins failed to do so. He recognized the fatal flaw in the opinion. Although Dr. Collins opined that it was not uncommon for pedophiles to collect items of child pornography, he was unable to form an opinion as to whether the appellant was a pedophile. Without that link, Det. Const. Pulkki was in the same position as she had been before she contacted Dr. Collins. All she had was a suspicion that the appellant might be in possession of child pornography. . . . This resulted in an unauthorized search for those items by means of what the trial judge correctly labelled a “fishing expedition”. This is what the search warrant process is meant to prevent.</p>

They facilitate the communication of information and the exchange of material of all kinds and forms, with both legal and illegal content, and in infinite quantities.&nbsp; No one can be unaware today that these technologies have accelerated the proliferation of child pornography because they make it easier to produce, distribute and access material in partial anonymity: Y. Akdeniz, <i>Internet Child Pornography and the Law: National and International Responses</i> (2008), at pp. 1-8. Not only do these technologies increase the availability of child pornography; they also raise new challenges, as&nbsp; the criminal law must be adapted to apply to the making, distribution, and possession of such material, while the resulting offences must be investigated in a manner consistent with fundamental rights.</p>

The computer was located in a spare bedroom where the three-year-old child was playing with toys on the floor. He saw that the accused already had access to the Internet, probably by means of a dial-up service. When he opened the Web browser, he noticed several links to both adult and child pornography in the taskbar’s “favourites” list, including two that were labelled “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX”. He also saw a pornographic image, but he could not remember afterwards if it was on the browser’s home page or on the computer desktop. The image was, in his words, “pretty graphic” and he wondered if the appellant’s&nbsp; wife “let him view and keep it on as their desktop”.&nbsp; From his experience in building the database for the anti-pornography software, Mr. Hounjet recognized “Lolita” as a term associated with child pornography.&nbsp; While working on the computer, he also noticed home videos and, on a tripod, a webcam that was connected to a videotape recorder and was pointed at the toys and the child instead of being aimed, as webcams usually are, at the computer user’s seat. The fact that the camera was pointed at the child would not normally have struck him as odd, but in light of the links on the computer to pornography, it troubled him. He did not click on the links to access the Web sites at that time.</p>

(The only reference in the record to the meaning of the word “formatted” is in Mr. Hounjet’s statement to the police. When asked what it meant, he answered: “The whole thing gets erased.&nbsp; The icons were gone” (A.R., at p. 209).)</p>

She in turn contacted the social services office in La Ronge on November 14, 2002. At that time, Mr. Hounjet’s concerns related to the child’s safety. On November 15, 2002, he went to the social services office and reported what he had seen. The social worker, Valerie&nbsp; Fosseneuve, contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (“RCMP”) on November 18, 2002 and reported the information received from Mr. Hounjet to Cpl. Susan Kusch. Cpl. Kusch then contacted Cpl. Mike Boyce of the RCMP’s Technological Crime Unit in Regina. Cpl. Boyce confirmed what Mr. Hounjet had said concerning the names of the Web sites, stating that “‘Lolita’ is an underage internet porn site that primarily deals with children 14 years old and under”. About a week later, Cst. Mark Ochitwa was assigned to investigate the matter.</p>

Ochitwa was out of the country for more than a week after being assigned to the investigation. When he tried to contact Mr. Hounjet on December 17, the latter was away until Christmas, and then Cst. Ochitwa was on holiday until the beginning of the new year. Cst. Ochitwa finally obtained Mr. Hounjet’s statement on January 8, 2003. After the interview, he consulted Cpl. Boyce, who he knew had experience investigating crimes involving computers and technological devices. Cpl. Boyce provided information about “media, storage media, computers, and specifically about this crime that these images are and would remain on a computer”. He also contacted a Crown Attorney in Regina, who suggested that he speak with Cst. Randy Huisman of the Saskatoon Police Service, who had experience investigating child exploitation offences. Cst. Huisman informed him that “these type of persons treasure collections, child pornography collections, similar to that of a coin collector or a stamp collector, and they categorize and catalogue these images and . . . their material”. Cst. Ochitwa also verified whether an active Internet connection was still being provided to the appellant’s residence. He then drafted an information to obtain a search warrant (“ITO”).&nbsp; It is reproduced as an appendix to these reasons, but the salient parts will be cited when most relevant.</p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:24.4pt">[127]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The concept of “reasonable grounds to believe” has been considered by this Court on numerous occasions. The most frequently cited formulation of the standard as applicable to the context of a search was articulated by Wilson J. in <i>R. v. Debot</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1166:</p>

Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 167, where Dickson J. (as he then was) stated that the Canadian “reasonable grounds to believe” requirement was identical to the “probable cause” threshold for a search warrant set out in the U.S. <i>Bill of Rights</i>. The Court described the requirement as “the point where credibly-based probability replaces suspicion” (p. 167). What Dickson J. was in fact trying to do in <i>Hunter </i>was to establish a criterion that elevated the grounds for a search beyond subjective belief and mere suspicion (at p. 167):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;line-height:12.2pt">The problem is with the stipulation of a reasonable belief that evidence <u>may</u> be uncovered in the search. Here again it is useful, in my view, to adopt a purposive approach. The purpose of an objective criterion for granting prior authorization to conduct a search or seizure is to provide a consistent standard for identifying the point at which the interests of the state in such intrusions come to prevail over the interests of the individual in resisting them. To associate it with an applicant’s reasonable belief that relevant evidence <u>may</u> be uncovered by the search, would be to define the proper standard as the <u>possibility</u> of finding evidence. This is a very low standard which would validate intrusion on the basis of suspicion, and authorize fishing expeditions of considerable latitude. It would tip the balance strongly in favour of the state and limit the right of the individual to resist, to only the most egregious intrusions. I do not believe that this is a proper standard for securing the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">Anglo‑Canadian legal and political traditions point to a higher standard. The common law required evidence on oath which gave “strong reason to believe” that stolen goods were concealed in the place to be searched before a warrant would issue. <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec443" target="_blank">Section 443<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> authorizes a warrant only where there has been information upon oath that there is “reasonable ground to believe” that there is evidence of an offence in the place to be searched. The American <i>Bill of Rights</i> provides that “no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation . . . .” The phrasing is slightly different but the standard in each of these formulations is identical. The state’s interest in detecting and preventing crime begins to prevail over the individual’s interest in being left alone at the point where credibly‑based probability replaces suspicion.

Rather, what the judge must do is identify credible facts that make the decision to authorize a search reasonable in view of all the circumstances. I therefore agree with the non-technical, common-sense approach taken by Rehnquist J. (as he then was) in <i>Illinois v. Gates</i>, 462 U.S. 213 (1983):</p>

It merely determines whether there was credible evidence on which the decision could be based. This exercise is not a <i>de novo </i>review. In <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at p. 1452, Sopinka J., writing for the majority, stated:</p>

If, based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified on the review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could have granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere. In this process, the existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant, but, rather than being a prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge.</p>

In my respectful opinion, co-mingling the issues and conflating the burdens of proof is precisely what my colleague Fish J. is doing.&nbsp; We are not asked to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to establish guilt.&nbsp; What is at issue is “whether there was any basis upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory preconditions existed”: <i>R. v.

Rather, this case may be decided on the narrower question — limited to the purpose of authorizing a search warrant — of what might be evidence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a person has committed the offence. However, even where the purpose is limited to this, it is essential to note that a specific intention to deal with the object in a particular manner is not an element of the offence of possession of child pornography.&nbsp; <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec4subsec3" target="_blank">Sections 4(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec163.1subsec4" target="_blank">163.1(4)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> indicate that possession of child pornography is criminal in and of itself, irrespective of the use to which the accused intends to put the prohibited material.&nbsp; The appellant urges the Court to rely on <i>R. v. York</i>, 2005 BCCA 74, 193 C.C.C. (3d) 331, to import a further intent requirement. That case was also referred to with approval by the majority of the Court of Appeal. However, the intent requirement from <i>York</i> is inapposite&nbsp; to the offence of possession of child pornography as set out in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. The Crown need not demonstrate that an accused intended to “deal” with the pornographic material in a certain manner.&nbsp; The requisite <i>mens rea </i>will be established at trial if it is shown that the accused willingly took or maintained control of the object with full knowledge of its character.&nbsp; It is reasonable to conclude that in criminalizing simple possession, Parliament has assumed that an individual who possesses child pornography intends to use it in a “prohibited manner”.&nbsp; This explains why statutory defences to charges relating to child pornography are provided in s. 163.1(6) of the <i>Code</i> — even if the elements of possession are made out, a person will not be convicted if he or she was in possession of child pornography for a “legitimate purpose” within the meaning of the <i>Code</i> and does not pose “an undue risk of harm” to someone under 18 years of age. The purpose for which an individual possesses child pornography does not change the fact of possession under the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; What the defences mean is simply that in certain instances, criminal liability will not follow from a finding that the offence of possession of child pornography is made out on the facts. Not only is the Crown not required to prove at trial that the accused intended to deal with the material in a certain manner, but it is not necessary when applying for a search warrant to make out actual possession in the ITO. It is sufficient that there be credible evidence to support a reasonable belief that the search will uncover evidence of commission of the offence.</p>

In asserting that “the images must be present on the computer <i>itself</i> in order to be in [the] possession” of an accused, he defines control too narrowly (emphasis in original).

Suffice it to say that the question before us turns not on whether the accused has merely viewed the material, but on whether evidence of control over the material could be found in the computer that was to be searched. Accessing does not necessarily require control, and possession does not necessarily require viewing. Therefore, for the purposes of the offence of possession, viewing might be one way to prove knowledge of the content, but it is not the only way. Similarly, viewing might be one way to prove control, but it may not be sufficient — the circumstances in which the material was viewed would need to be proven. Control, not viewing, is the defining element of possession.</p>

The record does not indicate that the reviewing judge was provided any evidence on caches. However, there is now abundant legal literature in which the authors have discussed caches, temporary Internet files, and deleted material that can be retrieved, all of which may, under relevant circumstances, constitute evidence of possession. The degree of control might be established on the basis, for example, of the displaying of the images and the ability to select, cut, enlarge, print, forward or share images: see G. Marin, “Possession of Child Pornography: Should You Be Convicted When the Computer Cache Does the Saving for You?” (2008), 60 <i>Fla. L. Rev.</i> 1205, at p. 1212; T. E.

Daniels</i>, 2004 NLCA 73, 242 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 290, and <i>Chalk</i>, Canadian courts of appeal have held that the Crown’s burden is one of proving possession of prohibited material on the basis of control. Acts other than downloading complete files can be sufficient evidence of control for the purpose of obtaining a conviction for possession. When, as in <i>Weir</i>, the material is attached to an e‑mail message, it may — even if the user has not downloaded it to his hard drive — serve as evidence of possession under relevant circumstances if, for example, the user either solicited the attachment or received it voluntarily with knowledge of its content. Similarly, when, as in <i>Daniels</i>, the computer user initiates the downloading of images but interrupts it, there is at least evidence of past control of the prohibited material.&nbsp; Distilled to their essence, these cases confirm that it is the assertion of control over the prohibited item that is at the core of the inquiry into whether possession was established, and that there is no requirement of a specific mode of control.</p>

As a practical matter, there is little difference between exercising control over the hard drive of a computer while on the premises where the computer is located and exercising control over of the on-line space of a Web-based hosted service. Moreover, if, to bring a cache into the scope of possession, the accused were required to have knowledge of how caches work, this would require proof of intent or technical savvy on the part of the accused.&nbsp; As I mentioned above, the requisite <i>mens rea </i>will be established at trial if it is shown that the accused willingly took control of the object with full knowledge of its character. In light of the inevitability of technological change, it is important not to needlessly handcuff the&nbsp; courts to a concept of possession that is limited to certain technologies or to current-day computer practices. Control has been the defining feature of possession, not the possibility of finding data files on a hard drive. To adopt downloading as the threshold criterion would be to take a formalistic approach rather than drawing a principled distinction between access and possession.&nbsp; The classical approach to possession, rooted in control, therefore remains the most reliable one. It is the one that is most readily adapted to technological developments and it will not require courts to hear detailed forensic evidence of technological advances on an ongoing basis just to keep up with the times.</p>

Moreover, to limit possession to material downloaded to the computer of the accused would be to render constructive possession all but inapplicable in the context of the Internet.

He submitted that the failure to mention that the child observed by Mr. Hounjet was his daughter and that the informant knew he resided with his wife could have misled the judge by creating an impression that the webcam and the toys were somehow linked to the offence of possession of child pornography, whereas there was no evidence supporting a conclusion that they were. The appellant also contended that the allegation that “the porn [was] removed” from the computer was false, since no child pornography was actually seen on the computer.</p>

From this perspective, the facts that the appellant was the child’s father and that he resided with his wife were not determinative.&nbsp; In Mr. Hounjet’s mind, what was at stake was the safety of <i>a</i> child. In addition, as I will explain below, the presence of the child, the toys, and the webcam form part of the entire set of relevant circumstances the authorizing judge could consider in deciding whether to issue the warrant.</p>

There could be no confusion about what was seen. In para. 5 of the ITO, “Lolita Porn” appears in quotation marks, and it is subsequently referred to in para. 10 as an “icon”. The information set out in para. 10 is more detailed, as the informant gives a fuller account there of the statement made by Mr. Hounjet.&nbsp; There is no question that what had, according to Mr. Hounjet, been&nbsp; removed from the computer were the links in the “favourites” list to child pornography.

Indeed, this propensity, which seems to be notorious, has been accepted in numerous child pornography cases as part of the factual backdrop giving rise to reasonable and probable grounds for issuing search warrants, and it has also been noted in the academic commentary on child pornography: <i>R. v. Neveu</i>, 2005 NSPC 51, 239 N.S.R. (2d) 59, at paras. 15‑17; <i>R. v. Fawthrop</i> (2002), 161 O.A.C. 350, at para. 14; <i>United States v.

Quayle, <i>Child Pornography: An Internet Crime</i> (2003), chapter 7, “The process of collecting”. Even if a lay person would not necessarily know that child pornography offenders collect such material, this appears to be something law enforcement officials working in computer technology or vice units encounter frequently. Testimony about this fact cannot therefore be compared to testimony about novel technology or science: <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9; <i>R. v.

Even if it had been doubtful that the <i>same</i> computer was still in the residence, the police officers’ statements concerning the proclivity of child pornography users to save and collect such material would have alleviated most concerns about the likelihood of finding evidence of possession of child pornography.</p>

Boyce and Cst. Huisman. It was on the issue of the delay that they became relevant. As stated in the ITO, Cpl. Boyce said that “these type of offenders are habitual and will continue their computer practices with child pornography”.&nbsp; He added that “this information will remain inside the hardrive of the computer and can be stored on media devices”. These statements could serve as a basis for concluding that it was reasonable to believe that, if the appellant was this type of offender, evidence of the offence would still be found in the computer after four months. The evidence in question would relate to the appellant’s computer practices and would continue to be stored in the computer or on media devices. Cst. Huisman’s statement, found in the ITO, that “offenders treasure collections on their computer and like to store them and create backup’s [<i>sic</i>] in case they loose it [<i>sic</i>]” is also relevant to the delay.</p>

In their decisions, they have relied on various combinations of three elements: the proclivity of offenders to collect child pornography, the application of common sense in light of the nature of the material, and the ability of computer forensics examiners to recover data. For example, in <i>Neveu</i> more than four years had elapsed between the closing of a Web site on which paying subscribers accessed child pornography and the issuance of the warrants.

The relevant question is simply whether there was a credible basis for issuing the warrant. In other words, in the instant case, the question is whether the facts alleged in the ITO as amplified at the <i>voir dire</i> were sufficient for the reviewing judge to conclude that there was a basis for the authorizing judge’s decision. Since the ITO submitted to the authorizing judge referred to both direct and circumstantial evidence, it is worth recalling the comments of McLachlin C.J. in <i>R. v. Arcuri</i>, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at para. 23, concerning the task a judge must perform in assessing the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; Although these comments were made in the context of a preliminary enquiry, they are relevant to the decision of a judge reviewing the authorization of a search where circumstantial evidence has been presented:</p>

In addition, the evidence was amplified before the reviewing judge. The appellant’s surprise when Mr. Hounjet arrived unannounced could reasonably support an inference that he was uncomfortable giving the technician access to the computer while sensitive material could be found there.&nbsp; The reviewing judge was told: “The icons themselves that would appear on the desktop are added by the user themself” (A.R., at p. 134). Therefore, the facts that there were several links to both adult and child pornography in the “favourites” list and that a “graphic” pornographic image was prominently displayed on the computer justified the judge’s drawing the reasonable inference that the appellant had a conspicuous interest in this type of material. His specific interest in child pornography was shown by the deliberate addition to his “favourites” list of links to child pornography. The fact that there were two links indicated that this interest was pronounced. Their presence in the “favourites” list also indicated that the appellant wanted to have easy access to the Web sites. The position of the camera and the fact that it was connected to a videotape recorder at the time of the technician’s first visit, together with the presence of both labelled and unlabelled videotapes, showed that he was interested in reproducing images, accumulating such material, and keeping it for his future use. The appellant’s desire not to arouse suspicion with respect to his reproduction of images or his computer practices could reasonably be inferred from his actions after being informed that the technician needed to return: removing the videotapes from the room, changing the direction the camera was pointed in, reformatting the computer and, more particularly, removing the suspect image and links. These actions by the appellant were relatively unexceptional if considered individually and out of context, but if viewed globally, it was possible for them to lead the reviewing judge to conclude that the authorizing judge had not erred in issuing the warrant.&nbsp; There was a credibly based probability that the appellant was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography.</p>
