Since s. 11 is directed to ensuring fairness at all stages of the criminal process, it cannot be concluded that s. 11(<i>b</i>) must necessarily be confined to the pre-stay, pre-verdict phase.</span></p>

Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771.&nbsp; My colleague considers first the case of an appeal from an acquittal.&nbsp; He concludes, at p. 000, that during this period "[n]o proceeding is on foot which seeks to charge the person acquitted", and states that the "plight of the acquitted person is that of one against whom governmental action is directed which may result in a charge."&nbsp; With respect, this diminishes the seriousness of the position of the acquitted person facing an appeal.&nbsp; Before a charge is laid, the suspect does not, generally speaking, suffer the stigma of criminal proceedings.&nbsp; The same cannot be said of an accused who is the subject of a post-acquittal appeal.&nbsp; He or she has in fact been charged.&nbsp; The law continues to require him or her to defend him- or herself against the charges.&nbsp; He or she must hire lawyers and plead before judges.&nbsp; While he or she has been acquitted, the prosecution continues to aver publicly that the acquittal is invalid.&nbsp; And he or she faces the distinct possibility of an order overturning the acquittal and entering a conviction or directing a new trial, a prospect which is not a speculative possibility but a real danger.&nbsp; The anxiety which an accused who has been acquitted faces while awaiting the possibility of a second trial must be considerable.&nbsp; In all these respects, the situation of an accused on an appeal from an acquittal is much closer to the situation of an accused awaiting trial than to a person who has not been charged.&nbsp; I respectfully cannot agree with my colleague's conclusion, at p. 000, that "[i]t would be incongruous to extend protection to the acquitted accused pending appeal and not to the suspect awaiting a charge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</span></p>

What is protected at all stages is the accused's right to a fair and timely criminal process.&nbsp; As seen above, stigma, anxiety and restrictions on liberty may adversely affect the subject of the proceedings after a stay or verdict, just as before.&nbsp; Similarly, the subject's opportunity to present a full defence at a post-appeal trial may be adversely affected by post-verdict or post-stay delay.&nbsp; The impact of these adverse effects on the accused must be put in the balance in determining whether the delay complained of was reasonable.</span></p>

Rahey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 614.&nbsp; However, where a verdict has been entered, a stay may not be appropriate.&nbsp; For example, a stay of proceedings would be useless to a convicted person complaining of appellate delay; indeed, it would deny him or her a just remedy by preventing him or her from proceeding with his or her appeal.&nbsp; The nearest alternative to a stay of proceedings, quashing the conviction, might seem inappropriate given that one would be releasing, not a person presumed to be innocent as at the pre-trial stage, but a convicted felon who has not served his or her sentence.&nbsp; To release a convicted killer into society, for example,&nbsp; without having served his or her sentence, solely because the appeal he or she chose to bring took more time than reasonable, would be to grant a remedy which far outstrips the wrong and which overlooks the important societal interest in the safety and security of members of the public.&nbsp; Confronted with these alternatives, a judge finding unreasonable delay in such a case might wish instead to make a different order.&nbsp; He or she might order that the appeal be expedited, for example.&nbsp; Nor would I rule out other remedies such as damages to compensate for loss of liberty or mental suffering, although I would leave the question of what remedies may be appropriate for resolution on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>

Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission)</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425.&nbsp; Accordingly, those interests are also entitled to protection at the appellate level but subject to the special considerations specific to the appellate process and in consequence the choice of an appropriate remedy.&nbsp; In particular, a stay should not as often be used as the appropriate remedy for appellate delay as for trial delay.&nbsp; On these matters, it will be obvious that I generally share the views of Justice McLachlin.&nbsp; I also agree with her regarding the appropriate court for considering delay.</span></p>

Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, that, although prejudice is only one factor to be taken into account in the balancing process, a conclusion that prejudice was absent or that it was minimal is significant.&nbsp; The rationale for the pre‑eminent position given to prejudice was held to be consistent for the purposes of s. 11(<i>b</i>) -- to protect the rights of the accused and the dual societal interest in seeing an accused treated humanely and fairly and in seeing those accused of crimes be brought to trial.</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">As I observed in <i>Canada v. Schmidt</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, the phrase "Any person charged with an offence" in the opening words of the section must be given a constant meaning that harmonizes with the various paragraphs of the section.&nbsp; It seems clear to me that for the purposes of s. 11 it would be quite inappropriate to conclude that a convicted person is charged with an offence when confronted with a Part XXI application.&nbsp; How can it be said that the right to the presumption of innocence until proven <u>guilty</u> (s. 11(<i>d</i>)) and the right to bail (s. 11(<i>e</i>)), for example, could have any application in the context of the unique post‑conviction proceeding mandated by Part XXI?&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

Conway</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, I have come to this conclusion in light of the considerable additional judicial experience of this Court in the application of s. 11(<i>b</i>) since the judgment in <i>Conway</i>.&nbsp; In particular, I refer to the judgment in <i>R. v.

L. (W.K.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 1091.</span></p>

Loud Hawk</i>, 474 U.S. 302 (1986), it was argued that the speedy trial guarantee in the 6th Amendment applied to an appeal by the government from a dismissal of charges prior to a trial on the merits by reason of excessive delay in prosecuting the charges.&nbsp; The court stated, at pp. 311-12:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Reynolds</i>, 898 F.2d 865 (2nd Cir. 1990), at p. 868; <i>United States v. Antoine</i>, 906 F.2d 1379 (9th Cir. 1990), at p. 1382; <i>United States v.

The Queen</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, at p. 457:</span></p>

L. (W.K.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, this Court held that, in respect of pre‑charge delay, if the particular circumstances of the case indicated that the fairness of the trial had been affected by the delay, s. 7 can be resorted to.&nbsp; This is simply the application to delay of the court's power to remedy an abuse of process which is enshrined in s. 7 as a principle of fundamental justice.&nbsp; The general principle was expressed in <i>R. v. Jewitt</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at pp. 136‑37.&nbsp; Dickson C.J. adopted the following passage from the judgment of Dubin J.A. (as he then was) in <i>R. v. Young</i> (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289, at p. 329:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">... there is a residual discretion in a trial court judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">This test has been reaffirmed in <i>R. v. Keyowski</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657.</span></p>

Gallagher</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 000, counsel for the respondent submitted that an appellate court should not decide matters of first instance which may require factual determinations.&nbsp; While neither solution is perfect I am of the opinion that the appropriate forum is the court in which the delay occurred.&nbsp; That court is in the best position to assess the consequences of delay.&nbsp; Moreover, this approach avoids the necessity of a referral back of the issue to a trial court whenever a serious case of delay is made out.&nbsp; In addition, it avoids the awkwardness inherent in a lower court's passing upon proceedings in a higher court which the latter must then review.&nbsp; While, generally matters of first instance are not decided in an appellate court the nature of the issues and the material in support would not be radically different from the issues and material in other motions which an appellate court is called upon to decide.&nbsp; If a further appeal lies from the first appellate court, the issue of delay can be reviewed in the second appellate court along with the consequences of additional delay resulting from the second appeal.&nbsp; As with other issues in appeal, this Court does not favour issues being raised for the first time in an appeal to this Court.</span></p>
