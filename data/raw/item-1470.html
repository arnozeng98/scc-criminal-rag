Although the latter surgery was successful, it led to the dislocation of her right hip, which caused considerable discomfort.&nbsp; As well, despite the administration of medication, Tracy experienced five to six seizures every day.</p>

Brydges</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 190, this Court engrafted two requirements upon the informational component: first, information about access to counsel free of charge provided by provincial Legal Aid where an accused meets financial criteria with respect to need, and second, information about access to duty counsel, who provide immediate and temporary legal advice to all accused, irrespective of financial need.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Thus, in <i>Bartle</i>, as well as in <i>Pozniak</i>, <i>Harper</i> and <i>Cobham</i>, s. 10(<i>b</i>) was violated because the accused persons in those cases were not informed on arrest about the existence of 24-hour duty counsel, accessible by a toll-free telephone number, available free of charge to all detainees.&nbsp; By contrast, in <i>Prosper</i> and <i>Matheson</i>, there was no violation of s. 10(<i>b</i>), because there was no toll-free, 24-hour duty counsel service.&nbsp; There was nothing useful to tell the accused.&nbsp; Thus, the proposition which emerges from these cases is that the nature of the information provided pursuant to s. 10(<i>b</i>) depends on the actual services available in a jurisdiction.&nbsp; As I said in <i>Prosper</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 259:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt"><u>if</u> there is in existence a 24-hour duty counsel service which can be accessed by dialling a toll-free number . . . this must be communicated to all detainees as part of the standard s. 10(<i>b</i>) caution delivered by police.&nbsp; <u>Obviously, it would make no sense to inform detainees of a service which does not in fact exist and which is, therefore, unavailable to them</u>.&nbsp; The point of the information component under s. 10(<i>b</i>) is to enable detainees to make informed decisions about services which actually exist.
