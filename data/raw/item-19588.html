Thus, only B’s confession was obtained in a manner that breached the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Balancing the lines of inquiry under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, admitting B’s confession into evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. </p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common law confessions rule provides that a confession to a person in authority is presumptively inadmissible, unless the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that it was voluntary. Under this rule, an involuntary confession always warrants exclusion. But a voluntary confession will not always be admitted into evidence: if a voluntary confession was “obtained in a manner” that breached the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, it<i> </i>can still potentially be excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>. At the heart of the confessions rule is the delicate balance between individual rights and collective interests in the criminal justice system. The twin goals of the rule involve protecting the rights of the accused without unduly limiting society’s need to investigate and solve crimes. On the one hand, the common law recognizes an individual’s right against self‑incrimination and right to remain silent; on the other, it is accepted that the police often need to speak to people when discharging their important public responsibility to investigate and solve crime.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voluntariness, broadly defined, is the touchstone of the confessions rule. It is a shorthand for a complex of values engaging policy concerns related to not only the reliability of confessions, but also to respect for individual free will, the need for the police to obey the law, and the fairness and repute of the criminal justice system. The application of the confessions rule is necessarily flexible and contextual. When assessing the voluntariness of a confession, the trial judge must determine, based on the whole context of the case, whether the statements made by an accused were reliable and whether the conduct of the state served in any way to unfairly deprive the accused of their free choice to speak to a person in authority. The trial judge must consider all relevant factors, including the presence of threats or promises, the existence of oppressive conditions, whether the accused had an operating mind, any police trickery that would shock the community, and the presence or absence of a police caution. These factors are not a checklist and do not supplant a contextual inquiry. Absent an error of law in relation to the applicable legal principles, a trial judge’s application of the voluntariness framework is a question of fact or of mixed fact and law attracting appellate deference. Mere disagreement with the weight given to various items of evidence is not a basis to reverse a trial judge’s finding of voluntariness.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police have statutory authority to arrest a person without a warrant under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec495" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;495<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which allows a peace officer to arrest a person if, on reasonable grounds, they believe the person has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence. A warrantless arrest requires subjective and objective grounds to arrest. The arresting officer must subjectively have reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest, and those grounds must be justifiable from an objective viewpoint. </p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In assessing the subjective grounds for arrest, the question is whether the arresting officer honestly believed that the suspect committed the offence. Subjective grounds for arrest are often established through the police officer’s testimony. This requires the trial judge to evaluate the officer’s credibility, a finding that attracts particular deference on appeal. The objective assessment is based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest, including the dynamics of the situation, as seen from the perspective of a reasonable person with comparable knowledge, training, and experience as the arresting officer. The arresting officer’s grounds for arrest must be more than a hunch or intuition. In evaluating the objective grounds to arrest, courts must recognize that the officer’s decision to arrest must often be made quickly in volatile and rapidly changing situations, and the officer must make their decision based on available information which is often less than exact or complete. At the same time, the police cannot rely on evidence discovered after the arrest to justify the subjective or objective grounds for arrest. Courts must also remember that determining whether sufficient grounds exist to justify an exercise of police powers is not a scientific or metaphysical exercise, but one that calls for the application of common sense, flexibility, and practical everyday experience. </p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Reasonable and probable grounds” as a basis for a warrantless arrest is a higher standard than “reasonable suspicion”. Reasonable suspicion requires a reasonable possibility of crime, while reasonable and probable grounds requires a reasonable probability of crime. The reasonable and probable grounds standard requires a reasonable belief that an individual is connected to the offence. A reasonable belief exists when there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information. It is the police officer who directed the arrest who must have reasonable and probable grounds. The existence of reasonable and probable grounds is a factual finding reviewable only for palpable and overriding error, yet whether the facts as found by the trial judge amount to reasonable and probable grounds is a question of law reviewable for correctness.&nbsp;The police’s failure to take detailed contemporaneous notes of the grounds for arrest and the material relied on in forming those grounds does not preclude a finding of reasonable and probable grounds. Although notes are generally desirable, they are not mandatory in all cases. Imposing such a requirement could undermine the <span style="line-height:200%">ability of the police to respond appropriately to the dynamic situations they face each day. </span>Furthermore, the lack of contemporaneous notes does not necessarily frustrate judicial review of warrantless arrests. Courts routinely evaluate the existence of reasonable and probable grounds based on the arresting officer’s testimony and other evidence.</p>

The cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry is overwhelmed by a compelling public interest in admitting B’s confession.

There is disagreement with the majority’s conclusion that it was lawful for the police, after learning of the circumstances of the accused’s unlawful detention, to immediately arrest them for murder and direct their continued questioning.

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police must have reasonable grounds to believe an individual committed or was about to commit an indictable offence in order to lawfully arrest them without prior judicial authorization. The reasonable belief must relate to two elements: whether an offence has been committed, and whether the person under arrest committed the offence. The test must be met on both a subjective and an objective basis, which means that it is necessary, but not sufficient, for the police to have a personal, honestly held belief in the presence of reasonable grounds. The Crown must also establish that the asserted grounds were objectively reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in the position of the officer. Reasonable grounds is a high threshold that is met at the point where a credibly‑based probability replaces suspicion. It requires the police to point to particularized evidence to support an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information. Whether the legal standard of reasonable grounds was met on the particular facts of a given case is a question of law to be assessed on a correctness standard.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need to establish reasonable grounds before effecting an arrest is not a mere procedural requirement — it is a constitutional imperative. An arrest is a key investigative step on which much hinges, both for the police and for the arrestee. It triggers intrusive police powers relating to detention, interrogation, search, and the use of force. Absent reasonable grounds, the intrusion on liberty interests tolerated in the name of the investigation of crime cannot be justified. The reasonable grounds standard is a key constitutional safeguard and must not be watered down for investigative expediency or to salvage an investigation in the face of <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>‑infringing conduct.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well‑recognized that police notes are crucial to the court’s ability to meaningfully review the exercise of police power without prior judicial authorization, including the arrest power. The absence of notes is a factor to be considered in deciding whether to accept the police officer’s testimony. In reviewing reasonable grounds, the absence of notes may inform the court’s assessment of the officer’s credibility, which is relevant to both the subjective and the objective elements of the test. Without notes, it is difficult to question assertions by the police that they had grounds to arrest the individual.&nbsp;Notes are therefore critical to checking the exercise of police power by ensuring that statements of personal belief do not go routinely or effectively unchallenged. The absence of notes may therefore hinder the accused’s ability to challenge the decision to arrest, and the court’s ability to get to the truth of the basis for that decision.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the instant case, the information that the homicide detective explained formed the basis of his decision to arrest the accused may have given rise to a reasonable suspicion, but to accept that it formed the basis of reasonable grounds to believe that they killed the deceased would erode the reasonable grounds standard to a level inconsistent with what is required to provide a meaningful check on the state’s investigatory powers in accordance with the<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>’s requirements. While the assessment is global and does not require an isolated parsing of each particular component or a <i>prima facie</i> case to answer on each element of the offence, there must be something of substance proffered in order to meet the objective reasonable grounds standard. The police have failed to offer a substantively reasonable basis to support the asserted belief that at the time of the accused’s arrest, there were reasonable grounds to believe they had killed the deceased.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that breaches the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>,<i> </i>courts should examine the entire relationship between the evidence and the breach to determine the strength of the connection and assess whether the breach and the evidence are part of the same transaction or course of conduct. The connection may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a combination of the three. A strict causal connection is not required. Instead, a global assessment is necessary to determine whether a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>violation occurred in the course of obtaining the evidence.

The appeals raise three issues: (1) the voluntariness of one of the appellants’ confessions under the common law confessions rule; (2) whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder; and (3) whether the appellants’ confessions were “obtained in a manner” that breached the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> because the police failed to make a “fresh start” from earlier <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breaches, and if their confessions were so obtained, whether they must be excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par2" class="">2</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Brian John Lambert and James Andrew Beaver, shared a townhouse in Calgary with the deceased, Sutton Bowers. One morning, Lambert called 9-1-1 and alleged that he and Beaver had arrived home to find Bowers dead in a puddle of blood. Lambert told the 9-1-1 operator that they did not know how Bowers had died, but he admitted that there had been “altercations all week”, including the night before when Bowers had told both Lambert and Beaver to “get the hell out” (R.R., at pp.&nbsp;17-18). The operator told Lambert that the townhouse would be treated as a crime scene for now.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par3" class="">3</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that the police officers who attended the scene in response to the 9-1-1 call breached the appellants’ <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights by detaining them and taking them to the police station without lawful authority. It is also not disputed that when homicide detectives realized that their colleagues had unlawfully detained the appellants, they promptly tried to make a “fresh start” by advising them of their <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights and then arresting them for murder. When questioned separately, the appellants initially denied any knowledge of how Bowers had died. Eventually, however, they both confessed to killing Bowers during a fight, mopping up his blood, and dragging his body to the bottom of the stairs to make his death look like an accident. At issue at trial was the admissibility of these confessions.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par4" class="">4</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellants argued that their confessions were involuntary and thus inadmissible under the common law confessions rule. The appellants also asserted that the police lacked reasonable and probable grounds to arrest them for murder. In the alternative, the appellants claimed that because the homicide detectives had failed to make a “fresh start” from the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breaches that stemmed from the appellants’ unlawful detention, their confessions were obtained in a manner that breached the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and must be excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par5" class="">5</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <i>voir dire</i>, the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta disagreed with the appellants and admitted their confessions into evidence (2019 ABQB 125, 88 Alta. L.R. (6th) 337). Based on this decision, the appellants entered an agreed statement of facts in which they admitted their role in the killing and invited the trial judge to convict them as co-principals to manslaughter. The trial judge did so and sentenced each to four years’ imprisonment (2019 ABQB 235). The Court of Appeal of Alberta dismissed the appellants’ appeals from conviction (2020 ABCA 203, 4 Alta. L.R. (7th) 301) and sentence (2021 ABCA 227). The appellants now appeal their convictions to this Court with leave. Only Beaver appeals the voluntariness of his confession. Both Beaver and Lambert claim that their confessions should be excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par6" class="">6</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeals, but for somewhat different reasons than the decisions under appeal. As I will explain, I agree with the lower courts that Beaver’s confession was voluntary and thus admissible under the common law confessions rule. I also agree that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder. However, I find that the homicide detectives made a “fresh start” from the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breaches arising from the appellants’ unlawful detention for Lambert but not for Beaver. Thus, only Beaver’s confession was obtained in a manner that breached the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Balancing the lines of inquiry under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, I conclude that admitting Beaver’s confession into evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I would thus confirm the appellants’ convictions for manslaughter.</p>

He told the 9-1-1 and Calgary Police Service operators that there had been “altercations all week”, including when he came home the previous night and Bowers “had people there” (p.&nbsp;17).

Lambert then confirmed that Bowers was not conscious or breathing, and advised that Beaver said that “he looks like he fell and hit his head” (p.&nbsp;26). The Calgary Police Service operator said that they would “treat [the townhouse] as a crime scene for now” (p. 27). While awaiting emergency medical services, the 9-1-1 operator told Lambert to perform CPR, but Lambert advised that rigor mortis<i> </i>had set in, adding: “He’s dead” (p.&nbsp;36).</p>

He ordered two other officers, Csts.&nbsp;Trent Taylor and Alana Husband, to detain Lambert and Beaver under the <i>Medical Examiners Act</i>, legislation that he admitted on the <i>voir dire</i> does not exist; he had meant to refer to Alberta’s <i>Fatality Inquiries Act</i>, R.S.A. 2000, c.&nbsp;F-9, but this Act provides no detention powers.</p>

He also reviewed a Police Information Management System report, which noted that three days earlier the police had attended at the townhouse because Lambert had reported that Bowers assaulted him but that he did not want charges laid and would not provide a statement.

Det.&nbsp;Hossack advised Beaver of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, but Beaver declined to speak to a lawyer, saying he did not think he needed one. He then added that he “probably should” speak with a lawyer and that he was “not understanding the severity of it” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;III, at p.&nbsp;53).

Applying <i>R. v.

Nothing Det.&nbsp;Hossack did during the interview broke Beaver’s will; “[w]hat did break his will was the version of events that Mr.&nbsp;Lambert had provided to Det.&nbsp;Demarino” (para.&nbsp;96). Det.&nbsp;Hossack’s failure to repeat the police caution that Cst.&nbsp;Husband previously provided did not deprive Beaver of a meaningful choice as to whether to speak to the police, since “[t]here is no requirement that the police repeat the caution” if the accused “already indicates that he understands his right to refuse to answer questions” (para.&nbsp;92).</p>

Spencer</i>, 2007 SCC 11, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para.&nbsp;11; <i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at paras.&nbsp;39, 68 and 89). Under the confessions rule, an involuntary confession “always warrants exclusion” (<i>Oickle</i>, at para.&nbsp;30; see also <i>R. v. Singh</i>, 2007 SCC 48, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, at para.&nbsp;38).

The “twin goals” of the rule involve “protecting the rights of the accused without unduly limiting society’s need to investigate and solve crimes” (<i>Oickle</i>, at para.&nbsp;33). On the one hand, the common law recognizes an individual’s right against self‑incrimination and right to remain silent, such that an individual need not give information to the police or answer their questions absent statutory or other legal compulsion; on the other hand, the police often need to speak to people when discharging their important public responsibility to investigate and solve crime.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par47" class="">47</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Voluntariness, broadly defined, is the “touchstone” of the confessions rule (<i>Oickle</i>, at paras.&nbsp;27, 32 and 69; <i>Spencer</i>, at para.&nbsp;11; <i>Singh</i>, at para.&nbsp;31). Voluntariness is a shorthand for a complex of values engaging policy concerns related to not only the reliability of confessions, but also to respect for individual free will, the need for the police to obey the law, and the fairness and repute of the criminal justice system. Involuntary confessions can be unreliable, unfair, and harmful to the reputation of the criminal justice system (<i>Oickle</i>, at paras.&nbsp;32 and 70; <i>Singh</i>, at paras.&nbsp;30 and 34; <i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at paras.&nbsp;70 and 72). A statement may be involuntary “because it is unreliable and raises the possibility of a false confession, or because it was unfairly obtained and ran afoul of the principle against self-incrimination and the right to silence” (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>,<i> </i>at para.&nbsp;70).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par48" class="">48</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application of the confessions rule is necessarily flexible and contextual. When assessing the voluntariness of a confession, the “trial judge must determine, based on the whole context of the case, whether the statements made by an accused were reliable and whether the conduct of the state served in any way to unfairly deprive the accused of their free choice to speak to a person in authority” (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;68). The trial judge must consider all relevant factors, including the presence of threats or promises, the existence of oppressive conditions, whether the accused had an operating mind, any police trickery that would “shock the community”, and the presence or absence of a police caution. These factors are not a checklist that supplants a contextual inquiry (see <i>Oickle</i>, at paras.&nbsp;47, 66-67 and 71; <i>Spencer</i>, at paras.&nbsp;11-12; <i>Singh</i>, at para.&nbsp;35; <i>Tessier (SCC)</i>,<i> </i>at paras.&nbsp;5, 68, 76 and 87).</p>

This Court has accepted that “[o]ppression clearly has the potential to produce false confessions” because a suspect may “confes[s] purely out of a desire to escape [inhumane] conditions” (<i>Oickle</i>, at paras.&nbsp;58 and 60). The non-exhaustive factors that can create oppressive conditions include depriving the suspect of food, clothing, water, sleep, or medical attention; denying access to counsel; or excessively aggressive, intimidating police questioning for a long time (<i>Oickle</i>,<i> </i>at paras.&nbsp;58-60; <i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;99).</p>

The King</i>, [1949] S.C.R. 262, at p. 267).</p>

Neither a caution nor proof of actual knowledge of the right to silence is a necessary condition of voluntariness (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at paras.&nbsp;12 and 74; see also <i>Singh</i>, at paras.&nbsp;31 and 33; <i>Boudreau</i>, at p.&nbsp;267). Nevertheless, the absence of a caution “weighs heavily” in the voluntariness analysis because it is “<i>prima facie</i> evidence that the suspect has been unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police and that, as a consequence, the statement cannot be considered voluntary” (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;11).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par52" class="">52</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the police have not given a caution, the Crown must “show that the absence of a caution did not undermine the suspect’s free choice to speak to the police as part of the contextual examination of voluntariness” (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;8). The absence of a caution may be afforded less weight when the suspect subjectively understood the right to silence or the consequences of speaking to the police. Kasirer&nbsp;J. provided the following guidance in <i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;88:</p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">While not necessary for the Crown to demonstrate, proof that the accused was in fact subjectively aware of their right to silence or aware of the consequences of speaking will be powerful evidence that the absence of a caution did not undermine voluntariness. In such an instance, doubts as to fairness that could result from the absence of a caution plainly do not arise because the suspect has the information necessary to choose whether to speak or remain silent.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par53" class="">53</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some of the non-exhaustive factors that can help show the suspect was subjectively aware of their right to silence or of the consequences of speaking to the police include (1) the suspect’s awareness of being recorded; (2) indications that the suspect is directing the conversation; (3) the suspect’s awareness of what is being investigated and their alleged role in the investigation; (4) the suspect’s exercise of the right to silence by declining to answer police questions; and (5) the suspect’s eagerness to talk, although this factor can weigh for and against such a finding, depending on the circumstances (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;88).</p>

He claims that the trial judge mechanically reviewed a checklist of voluntariness factors without considering the more fundamental question of whether he could make a meaningful choice to speak to the police when he was not informed of his jeopardy or properly advised that he had a choice about whether to give a statement. He also says that the duration of his interview and Det.&nbsp;Hossack’s “interview strategy” created an oppressive atmosphere.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par59" class="">59</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge found as fact that Beaver was given a police caution and understood it (paras.&nbsp;90-91). He was given a police caution at the scene, even if only when he was unlawfully detained. Cst.&nbsp;Husband used standard wording, telling him: “You’re not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say may be given in evidence” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;III, at p.&nbsp;30; see also <i>Singh</i>, at para.&nbsp;31; <i>R. v. Manninen</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, at p.&nbsp;1237). This caution informed Beaver of his right to remain silent “in plain language” (<i>Singh</i>, at para.&nbsp;31).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par60" class="">60</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge appreciated that the question before him was whether Beaver’s confession was voluntary, even though Det.&nbsp;Hossack did not caution Beaver during her interview at the station but referred back to Cst.&nbsp;Husband’s caution at the scene (paras.&nbsp;90-91). The trial judge stated that “[t]here is no requirement that the police repeat the caution more than once if the accused person already indicates that he understands his right to refuse to answer questions” (para.&nbsp;92).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par61" class="">61</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the fact that Det.&nbsp;Hossack did not caution Beaver again upon his arrest is not “<i>prima facie</i> evidence that the suspect has been unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police” (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;11). Unlike the accused in <i>Tessier</i>,<i> </i>Beaver had been cautioned and understood the caution. Even if it would have been preferable for Det.&nbsp;Hossack to have repeated the caution when Beaver was arrested for murder, a caution is not a condition of voluntariness (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;89). Put otherwise, the absence of a caution in itself does not “bind the hands of the Court” by automatically rendering a subsequent confession involuntary (<i>Boudreau</i>, at p.&nbsp;267, quoted by Charron&nbsp;J. in <i>Singh</i>, at para.&nbsp;31).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par62" class="">62</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, and relatedly, the trial judge found as fact that Beaver knew why Det.&nbsp;Hossack was interviewing him after he had been arrested for murder and what he would be questioned about (paras.&nbsp;83, 93 and 246). Before proceeding with the interview, Det.&nbsp;Hossack told Beaver “right now you’re under arrest for murder” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;III, at p.&nbsp;51; ABQB <i>voir dire</i> reasons, at para.&nbsp;93). Thus, even though Beaver did not know his jeopardy when he was unlawfully detained, he did know his jeopardy when he was arrested.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par63" class="">63</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beaver subjectively knew the consequences of speaking with the police upon his arrest (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;88). For example, in formally waiving his right to counsel, Beaver confirmed that he understood that Det.&nbsp;Hossack could only take a statement from him if Det.&nbsp;Hossack was sure that Beaver did not want to exercise his right to contact a lawyer and that any statement he gave could be used in evidence against him. Det.&nbsp;Hossack also told Beaver four times that everything he said was being recorded, which Beaver acknowledged. Beaver then initiated the conversation by asking Det.&nbsp;Hossack, “[o]kay, where should I start? How ‘bout yesterday?” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;III, at p.&nbsp;58).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par64" class="">64</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the trial judge found as fact that Beaver “knew exactly why Det.&nbsp;Hossack was interviewing him” (para.&nbsp;93), this is a case in which “doubts as to fairness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from the absence of a caution plainly do not arise” (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;88).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par65" class="">65</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even so, Beaver argues that Det.&nbsp;Hossack unfairly deprived him of a meaningful choice about whether to speak to the police. He says that Det.&nbsp;Hossack was “deliberately casual” when arresting him for murder, including by telling him the caution was “no different than what uh, Constable Husband read to [him]” and that being arrested “doesn’t mean [he’s] gonna be charged with anything. All that means is right now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that [he] can’t leave, ‘kay?” (Beaver factum, at para.&nbsp;37; A.R., vol.&nbsp;III, at p.&nbsp;51). It is this “pernicious” language that Beaver impugns (Beaver factum, at para.&nbsp;37).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par66" class="">66</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree. It was legally and factually accurate for Det.&nbsp;Hossack to tell Beaver that being arrested for murder did not necessarily mean he would be charged with murder (see <i>R. v. Brown</i>,<i> </i>2015 ONSC 3305, at para.&nbsp;124 (CanLII)). Beaver also says that Det.&nbsp;Hossack sent a mixed signal about the jeopardy he faced after he had been arrested for murder by saying “in a cautionary way [they] have to charter everyone” (Beaver factum, at para.&nbsp;37; A.R., vol.&nbsp;III, at p.&nbsp;54). But the trial judge referred to and weighed all these statements in finding that Beaver “knew exactly why Det.&nbsp;Hossack was interviewing him”. This Court must defer to that finding (<i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras.&nbsp;15-18). In effect, Beaver is asking this Court to reweigh the evidence to reverse the trial judge’s finding of voluntariness. I would decline to do so.</p> 
 <p class="Title5LevelTitre5Niveau" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify"><a name="_Toc109915210"><span style="text-decoration:none">(iii)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Beaver’s Interview Was Not Oppressive</a></p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par67" class="">67</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the trial judge found as fact that the circumstances of Beaver’s interview were not oppressive (paras.&nbsp;95-96). I disagree with Beaver’s claim that Det.&nbsp;Hossack created an oppressive atmosphere by asking increasingly confrontational questions during an interview that spanned 13&nbsp;hours. Although Beaver’s interview was long, it was not the type of “excessively aggressive and intimidating” interview contemplated as oppressive in <i>Oickle</i> (<i>Tessier (SCC)</i>, at para.&nbsp;99). The trial judge described the interview as “conversation[al]” in nature and highlighted that Det.&nbsp;Hossack was “respectful” when interviewing Beaver, before becoming only “somewhat more confrontational” when presenting him with Lambert’s videotaped confession (para.&nbsp;95). Although the trial judge accepted that, in principle, “subjecting the accused person to aggressive and prolonged questioning” can be an oppressive tactic affecting voluntariness (at para.&nbsp;94), he found as fact that the atmosphere of the interview did not “break [Mr.&nbsp;Beaver’s] will” (para.&nbsp;96). Instead, the trial judge found that what broke Beaver’s will was having to face “the version of events that Mr.&nbsp;Lambert had provided to Det.&nbsp;Demarino” in the videotaped confession (para.&nbsp;96).</p>

Because Beaver has not established that any palpable and overriding error infected the trial judge’s findings of fact, I must defer to his conclusion that Beaver’s confession was voluntary.</p>

It is uncontested that Det.&nbsp;Vermette instructed the homicide detectives to arrest the appellants after they had been arbitrarily detained for just over two hours.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:99.0pt;text-indent:-40.5pt">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A warrantless arrest requires subjective and objective grounds to arrest. The arresting officer must subjectively have reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest, and those grounds must be justifiable from an objective viewpoint (<i>R. v. Storrey</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at pp.&nbsp;250-51; <i>R. v. Latimer</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217, at para.&nbsp;26; <i>R. v. Tim</i>, 2022 SCC 12, at para.&nbsp;24).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:99.0pt;text-indent:-40.5pt">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the subjective grounds for arrest, the question is whether the arresting officer honestly believed that the suspect committed the offence (<i>R. v. Shepherd</i>, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para.&nbsp;17). Subjective grounds for arrest are often established through the police officer’s testimony (see, for example, <i>Storrey</i>, at p.&nbsp;251; <i>Latimer</i>, at para.&nbsp;27; <i>Tim</i>, at para.&nbsp;38). This requires the trial judge to evaluate the officer’s credibility, a finding that attracts particular deference on appeal (<i>R. v. G.F.</i>, 2021 SCC 20, at para.&nbsp;81; <i>R. v. Beaudry</i>, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para.&nbsp;4).</p>

This objective assessment is based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest, including the dynamics of the situation, as seen from the perspective of a reasonable person with comparable knowledge, training, and experience as the arresting officer (<i>Storrey</i>, at pp.&nbsp;250-51; <i>Latimer</i>, at para.&nbsp;26; <i>Tim</i>, at para.&nbsp;24).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:99.0pt;text-indent:-40.5pt">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence based on the arresting officer’s training and experience should not be uncritically accepted, but neither should it be approached with “undue scepticism” (<i>R. v. MacKenzie</i>, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at paras.&nbsp;64-65). Although the analysis is conducted from the perspective of a reasonable person “standing in the shoes of the [arresting] officer”, deference is not necessarily owed to their view of the circumstances because of their training or experience (<i>R. v. Chehil</i>, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at paras.&nbsp;45 and 47; <i>MacKenzie</i>, at para.&nbsp;63). The arresting officer’s grounds for arrest must be more than a “hunc[h] or intuition” (<i>Chehil</i>, at para.&nbsp;47).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:99.0pt;text-indent:-40.5pt">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In evaluating the objective grounds to arrest, courts must recognize that, “[o]ften, the officer’s decision to arrest must be made quickly in volatile and rapidly changing situations. Judicial reflection is not a luxury the officer can afford. The officer must make his or her decision based on available information which is often less than exact or complete” (<i>R. v. Golub</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.), at p.&nbsp;750, per Doherty&nbsp;J.A.). Courts must also remember that “[d]etermining whether sufficient grounds exist to justify an exercise of police powers is not a ‘scientific or metaphysical exercise’, but one that calls for the application of ‘[c]ommon sense, flexibility, and practical everyday experience’” (<i>R. v. Canary</i>, 2018 ONCA 304, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 63, at para.&nbsp;22, per Fairburn&nbsp;J.A. (as she then was), citing <i>MacKenzie</i>, at para.&nbsp;73).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:99.0pt;text-indent:-40.5pt">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Reasonable and probable grounds” is a higher standard than “reasonable suspicion”. Reasonable suspicion requires a <i>reasonable possibility</i> of crime, while reasonable and probable grounds requires a <i>reasonable probability</i> of crime (<i>Chehil</i>, at para.&nbsp;27; <i>R. v. Debot</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p.&nbsp;1166). At the same time, police do not require a <i>prima facie</i> case for conviction before making an arrest (<i>Storrey</i>, at p.&nbsp;251; <i>Shepherd</i>, at para.&nbsp;23; <i>Tim</i>, at para.&nbsp;24). Nor do the police need to establish that the offence was committed on a balance of probabilities (<i>Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 2005 SCC 40, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 100, at para.&nbsp;114; see also <i>R. v. Henareh</i>,<i> </i>2017 BCCA 7, at para.&nbsp;39 (CanLII); <i>R. v. Loewen</i>, 2010 ABCA 255, 490 A.R. 72, at para.&nbsp;18). Instead, the reasonable and probable grounds standard requires “a reasonable belief that an individual is connected to the offence” (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><i>MacKenzie</i>, </span>at para.&nbsp;74 (emphasis deleted); <i>Debot</i>, at p.&nbsp;1166). A reasonable belief exists when “there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information” (<i>Mugesera</i>,<i> </i>at para.&nbsp;114; see also <i>R. v. Al&nbsp;Askari</i>,<i> </i>2021 ABCA 204, 28 Alta. L.R. (7th) 129, at para.&nbsp;25; <i>R. v. Omeasoo</i>, 2019 MBCA 43, [2019] 6 W.W.R. 280, at para.&nbsp;30; <i>R. v. Summers</i>,<i> </i>2019 NLCA 11, 4 C.A.N.L.R. 156, at para.&nbsp;21). The police are also not required to undertake further investigation to seek exculpatory facts or to rule out possible innocent explanations for the events before making an arrest (<i>Chehil</i>, at para.&nbsp;34; <i>Shepherd</i>, at para.&nbsp;23; <i>R. v. Ha</i>, 2018 ABCA 233, 71 Alta. L.R. (6th) 46, at para.&nbsp;34; <i>R. v. MacCannell</i>, 2014 BCCA 254, 359 B.C.A.C. 1, at paras.&nbsp;44-45; <i>R. v.

Instead, they contend that a warrantless arrest is unlawful where the police fail to take detailed contemporaneous notes of their grounds for arrest and the material relied on in forming those grounds. They claim that the lack of contemporaneous notes frustrates a court’s ability to review the existence of subjective grounds for arrest, the information known to the officer at the time of arrest, and whether this information justifies the subjective grounds from an objective viewpoint.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par75" class="">75</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that contemporaneous notes are generally desirable when determining whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds for a warrantless arrest, but I disagree that such notes should be mandatory in all cases. This Court has insisted on detailed notes to justify the police conducting warrantless cell phone searches (<i>R. v. Fearon</i>, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para.&nbsp;82), and has encouraged them in several contexts, including for strip searches (<i>R. v. Golden</i>, 2001 SCC 83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679, at para.&nbsp;101), for warranted searches of a computer (<i>R. v. Vu</i>,<i> </i>2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para.&nbsp;70), and after searching a home incident to arrest (<i>R. v. Stairs</i>,<i> </i>2022 SCC 11, at para.&nbsp;81). However, our law has never insisted on contemporaneous notes for all warrantless arrests, nor would I impose such a requirement. Insisting on contemporaneous notes in all cases could undermine the <span style="line-height:200%">ability of the police to respond appropriately to the dynamic situations they face each day.</span></p>

Courts routinely evaluate the existence of reasonable and probable grounds based on the arresting officer’s testimony and other evidence (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Nguyen</i>,<i> </i>2017 BCPC 131; <i>R. v. Kroeker</i>,<i> </i>2019 BCPC 127; <i>R. v. Rauch</i>,<i> </i>2022 BCPC 117; <i>R. v. Daley</i>, 2015 ONSC 7367).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par78" class="">78</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge accepted Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s testimony that he had subjective reasonable and probable grounds to direct the appellants’ arrests for murder <span style="line-height:200%">(paras.&nbsp;151, 153, 157, 232 and 240)</span>. That finding is uncontested. The contested issue is whether those grounds were objectively reasonable. The appellants say that Det.&nbsp;Vermette had no more than an “impression” that Bowers’ death was suspicious, which fails to meet the threshold of credibly based probability that the appellants murdered Bowers.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par79" class="">79</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree. I readily accept that some of the evidence Det.&nbsp;Vermette had when he formed his reasonable and probable grounds may have pointed towards Bowers’ death being an accident rather than murder. This includes, for example, Lambert’s statement to the 9-1-1 operator that “[Beaver] says he looks like he fell and hit his head” (R.R., at p.&nbsp;26). But Det.&nbsp;Vermette did not have to rule out possible innocent explanations of Bowers’ death before arresting the appellants<span style="line-height:200%">.</span> Nor did he require a <i>prima facie </i>case for conviction.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par80" class="">80</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also readily accept that the police relied on circumstantial evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants, but this is not unusual. When the police learn of a suspicious death and there is no direct evidence of who may be responsible, they routinely look to motive and opportunity to further their investigation. For example, in <i>Latimer</i>, at para.&nbsp;27, this Court held that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest a father for the murder of his severely disabled daughter based on the circumstantial evidence that carbon monoxide was found in the daughter’s blood, strongly suggesting that she had been poisoned; that it was unlikely that her death was accidental; that given her physical condition, her death could not have been suicide; and that the father had both motive and opportunity. This is not to say that motive, opportunity, and a suspicious death will establish reasonable and probable grounds to arrest for murder in every case. Whether circumstantial evidence of this nature establishes grounds to arrest will depend on the facts and the strength of the evidence.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par81" class="">81</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial<i> </i>judge’s factual findings confirm that Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s belief that the appellants were connected to Bowers’ death was objectively reasonable when he directed their arrest. Far from having a mere suspicion, Det.&nbsp;Vermette had compelling and credible information that the appellants had motive to kill Bowers, that they had the opportunity to act on this motive, and that Bowers’ death was suspicious. </p>

These factual findings were amply supported by the information before Det.&nbsp;Vermette when he formed his subjective reasonable and probable grounds. The appellants had motive to kill Bowers based on the recent history of conflict and violence in the townhouse that had led to “altercations all week”, including the night before when Bowers had angrily told the appellants to “get the hell out”, and a few days earlier when the police had attended the townhouse after Lambert claimed that Bowers had assaulted him. The appellants also had the opportunity to kill Bowers because they lived with him, they were the last known persons to see him alive, and they claimed to have discovered his body at the townhouse before placing the 9‑1‑1 call (para.&nbsp;143).</p>

His view was supported by the call he had received from <span style="line-height:200%">S/Sgt.&nbsp;</span>Chisholm calling him into work. S/Sgt.&nbsp;Chisholm had advised him that he had spoken with the medical investigator’s office, which had “vast experience” and which had advised that the homicide team needed to be called out to investigate because the “death investigator” had identified “issues” or “problems” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;I, at pp.&nbsp;238-39). As Det.&nbsp;Vermette put it, the medical investigator’s office effectively said, “[h]ey, this is suspicious” (p.&nbsp;239). Det.&nbsp;Vermette viewed this as “important” because he knew from experience how the medical investigator’s office triaged calls in cases of suspicious deaths (p.&nbsp;227). S/Sgt.&nbsp;Chisholm’s follow-up email to him also had the subject line “Looks like New homicide”. None of this information had been available to the police when the appellants were unlawfully detained, but all of it was available to them when they arrested the appellants for murder.</p>

Bowers was found dead in the townhouse he lived in with the appellants, the morning after he had argued with them and had angrily told them to “get the hell out”. This atmosphere of violence was not an isolated incident: Lambert told the 9-1-1 operator that there had been “altercations all week” and alleged that Bowers assaulted him just three days earlier.</p>

Det.&nbsp;Vermette was confronted with this theory on cross‑examination and rejected it as “not accurate” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;I, at p.&nbsp;256). His unchallenged evidence was that when he directed the appellants’ arrests, he was “already satisfied” of the grounds for arrest because he had reviewed all the relevant material over the course of the morning (p.&nbsp;256).</p>

Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s grounds went well beyond a hunch or intuition and objectively justified his reasonable belief that the appellants were involved in Bowers’ killing.</p>

The accused provided no incriminating information until he was confronted with one of his earlier incriminating statements, at which point he made a third incriminating statement. Fish&nbsp;J. ruled that by referring to the earlier incriminating statement, the police “intentionally and explicitly bridged” the gap between the inadmissible statement and the third statement, thus preserving the temporal, causal, and contextual connections between them (para.&nbsp;22). He explained that “[w]hat began as a <i>permissible</i> fresh start thus ended as an <i>impermissible</i> interrogation inseparably linked to its tainted past” (para.&nbsp;3 (emphasis in original)). The third statement was thus “obtained in a manner” that breached the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and was then excluded under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</p>

During questioning, the accused gave his written consent to provide the police with a saliva sample for DNA analysis for the sexual assault investigation. When giving this consent, the accused acknowledged that he did not have to provide the sample, that it could be used against him in criminal proceedings, and that he had the right to discuss with a lawyer whether to provide it. The DNA analysis of the saliva sample ultimately incriminated the accused in the sexual assaults. In ruling that the saliva sample was admissible, Doherty&nbsp;J.A. acknowledged that the police breached <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;10(b)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> by failing to advise the accused of his right to counsel in relation to the sexual assault investigation, but ruled that the police made a “fresh start” by severing this earlier <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breach from their later conduct. In Doherty&nbsp;J.A.’s view, by obtaining the accused’s written consent for the saliva sample, “the officers administered a focussed and powerful antidote to their earlier <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;10(b)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> breach” (para.&nbsp;70), and drove “a wedge between the giving of the sample and the earlier breach of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;10(b)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>” (para.&nbsp;74). Doherty&nbsp;J.A. concluded that because the police had “effectively disconnected the decision to give the sample from any potential effect of the prior <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;10(b)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> breach” (para.&nbsp;74), the saliva sample was not “obtained in a manner” that breached the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

Although many “fresh start” cases have involved successive statements to persons in authority (see, for example, <i>Plaha</i>; <i>Lewis</i>; <i>Woods</i>; <i>Hamilton</i>; <i>McSweeney</i>), I agree with the observation of Watt&nbsp;J.A. in <i>Manchulenko</i>, at para.&nbsp;70, that “[n]o principled reason exists to confine the ‘fresh start’ jurisprudence” to such cases and that “[t]he rationale that underpins the ‘fresh start’ principle is the same irrespective of the specific form the evidence proposed for admission takes”.</p>

By taking these steps, Det.&nbsp;Demarino addressed the previous failure to advise Lambert of the extent of his jeopardy when he had been unlawfully detained. Det.&nbsp;Demarino then facilitated Lambert’s second consultation with counsel, confirmed that he understood the advice he had been given, repeated to him that they “have to start everything all over again”, and provided him with a primary caution three times and a secondary caution once.

As he explained, “[e]vents that occur during the time interval can colour the significance of the passage of time” (para.&nbsp;49; see also <i>Manchulenko</i>, at para.&nbsp;73).

It is also societal in scope: its goal is not to punish the police but to address systemic concerns involving the broad impact of admitting the evidence on the long‑term repute of the justice system (see <i>Grant</i>, at paras.&nbsp;69-70 and 85-86; <i>Le</i>, at para.&nbsp;139; <i>Tim</i>, at para.&nbsp;98).</p>

The cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry is overwhelmed by a compelling public interest in admitting Beaver’s confession.

Shortly after arriving at the scene, police unlawfully detained the appellants pursuant to non-existent legislation, transported them to police headquarters for questioning, and searched them upon arrival. During Mr.&nbsp;Lambert’s transport, police questioned him before facilitating his request to exercise his right to counsel. This conduct resulted in multiple serious breaches of the appellants’ rights under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

First, on whether it was lawful for the lead investigator, after learning of the circumstances of the appellants’ unlawful detention, to immediately arrest them for murder and direct their continued questioning. I conclude that the information relied on to direct the appellants’ arrests does not come close to the particularized probability required to meet the reasonable grounds standard. The arrests were a blatant attempt to salvage the investigation in the face of what officers knew were multiple serious violations of the appellants’ <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights. The accumulation of breaches of well-established <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>standards in this case requires that the evidence be excluded as a remedy under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>to avoid bringing further disrepute to the administration of justice. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par140" class="">140</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the test for inclusion under s.&nbsp;24(2) is long established and well known. The focus is on the connection between the breach and the evidence obtained, with reference to temporal, contextual, and causal elements (<i>R. v. Strachan</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980; <i>R. v. Goldhart</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 463; <i>R. v. Wittwer</i>, 2008 SCC 33, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 235). There is simply no need to speak in terms of whether or not there was somehow a “fresh start” for those who have breached <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights. Indeed, the notion of a “fresh start” is an unhelpful and potentially misleading concept that has no place in the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> analysis. It divides what is to be a holistic analysis into before and after segments and operates to cure and/or remove <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breaches from the analysis, thus placing a heavy finger on the scale of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>. &nbsp;</p>

Thus, while I should not be taken as accepting the majority’s voluntariness analysis, I find it unnecessary to address the voluntariness issue raised by Mr.&nbsp;Beaver.</p>

He told the 9‑1‑1 operator that he and Mr.&nbsp;Bowers had been having “altercations” all week. When he came home the previous evening, Mr.&nbsp;Bowers told him and his other roommate, Mr.&nbsp;Beaver, to “get the hell out” (R.R., at p.&nbsp;18). They left Mr.&nbsp;Bowers at home with guests and returned that morning to find his body in the townhouse. </p>

They observed the deceased lying at the base of “a fairly steep set of polished hardwood stairs” (2019 ABQB 125, 88 Alta. L.R. (6th) 337, at para. 7). An empty bottle of rum was left out on a table (para. 10). Mr.&nbsp;Lambert informed one of the officers, Cst.&nbsp;Taylor, that it was not unusual for the deceased to be passed out from intoxication. None of the officers observed either of the appellants acting suspiciously. There were no signs of a struggle at the scene. </p>

He directed two officers, Cst.&nbsp;Husband and Cst.&nbsp;Taylor, to detain the appellants under the <i>Medical Examiners Act</i>. He testified that he meant to refer to the <i>Fatality Inquiries Act</i>, R.S.A. 2000, c.&nbsp;F‑9, as he believed this legislation authorized police to detain people at the scene of a potential homicide. He acknowledged that he erred in two respects: there is no such legislation as the <i>Medical Examiners Act</i> in Alberta, and the <i>Fatality Inquiries Act</i> provides no detention power to police. </p>

She told him that she had to “read [him] the legalities” and that she was “investigatively detaining [him] for, uh, whatever’s going on in there, (laughing)” (A.R., vol. III, at p.&nbsp;28). She testified that she did not know what Mr.&nbsp;Beaver was under investigative detention for; he was taken into custody because police did not know whether he was a witness or an offender and they needed to find out his involvement. </p>

During the car ride, he asked Mr.&nbsp;Lambert about what had happened.

At 10:36&nbsp;a.m., he received a phone call from S/Sgt. Chisholm calling out the homicide unit to investigate a death. During this call, S/Sgt.&nbsp;Chisholm indicated that he had spoken to the medical investigator and a man had been found face down in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs near the front entrance of a residence. He informed Det.&nbsp;Vermette that there had been some conflict or dispute between the victim and his roommates, who were being transported to the police detachment.

They informed him that the appellants had been “<i>Charter</i>ed and cautioned” and provided with an opportunity to speak with legal counsel (A.R., vol. I, at p.&nbsp;210). Det.&nbsp;Vermette was “assuming” that they had been arrested for murder (p. 251). He assigned Det.&nbsp;Hossack and Det.&nbsp;Demarino to interview Mr.&nbsp;Lambert and Mr.&nbsp;Beaver, respectively. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par152" class="">152</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det.&nbsp;Vermette testified that when he met with Csts.&nbsp;Husband and Taylor, he did not have reasonable grounds to arrest the appellants.</p>

The material included an “Event Information”, which provided a summary of the case based on the 9‑1‑1 call and some remarks inputted from officers, and an “Event Chronology”, which essentially repeated the content of the Event Information. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par154" class="">154</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Event Information indicated that the 9-1-1 call was categorized as “medical – sudden death” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;III, at p.&nbsp;321). It identified the townhouse as a location of interest, or “LOI”, because Mr.&nbsp;Lambert had previously made a complaint about his landlord, Mr.&nbsp;Bowers. It also indicated that police and emergency medical services had been called to the townhouse in August of that year, about three months prior to the 9‑1‑1 call, to perform a mental health check on Mr.&nbsp;Bowers after he had drank floor cleaner in what Det.&nbsp;Vermette described as an “attempted suicide kind of situation” (A.R., vol.&nbsp;I, at p.&nbsp;217). The Event Information showed that Mr.&nbsp;Bowers had a criminal history for violence, but showed no criminal history for either of the appellants. Det.&nbsp;Vermette testified he believed the Event Information was important because it showed there was an “environment of violence” at the townhouse (p.&nbsp;219).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par155" class="">155</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.&nbsp;Lambert’s complaint about Mr.&nbsp;Bowers was further detailed in a Police Information Management System (“PIMS”) report, which also formed part of the file. The PIMS report indicated that three days before the 9-1-1 call, Mr.&nbsp;Lambert had reported to police that Mr.&nbsp;Bowers had been drinking and punched him in the groin. Mr.&nbsp;Lambert called police to inquire about the process if charges were pursued, but the report noted that he did not wish to lay charges, provide a statement, or further involve police. He planned to move out within the next two weeks. Det.&nbsp;Vermette explained that he viewed the PIMS report as important because it corroborated the “environment of violence” from the Event Information.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par156" class="">156</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly after beginning Mr.&nbsp;Lambert’s interview, Det.&nbsp;Demarino learned of the circumstances of the appellants’ detention from Cst.&nbsp;Husband. Recognizing the serious legal issues engaged, he brought his concerns to Det.&nbsp;Vermette. Det.&nbsp;Vermette then instructed the interviewing detectives to arrest the appellants for murder, re-do their cautions, and proceed with the interviews. He testified that he took at most two minutes to make the decision to arrest the appellants after he learned of the circumstances of their detention.

When Mr.&nbsp;Beaver expressed surprise that he was under arrest, Det.&nbsp;Hossack reassured him all this meant was that he could not leave.

Mr.&nbsp;Beaver told Det.&nbsp;Hossack that he did not think he needed counsel, but he was “not understanding the severity of it” (A.R., vol. III, at p.&nbsp;53). In response, Det.&nbsp;Hossack explained to Mr.&nbsp;Beaver that he was brought to police headquarters because he was at the scene where the body was found and told him, “we need to figure out what’s going on and because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you were there um, just kind of in a, in a cautionary way we have to charter everyone” (p.&nbsp;54).</p>

C-46, s.&nbsp;495(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(a)). The reasonable belief must relate to two elements: whether an offence has been committed, and whether the person under arrest committed the offence. The test must be met on both a subjective and an objective basis. This means that it is necessary, but not sufficient, for the police to have a personal, honestly held belief in the presence of reasonable grounds. The Crown must also establish that the asserted grounds were objectively reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in the position of the officer (<i>R. v. Storrey</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at pp.&nbsp;250-51). </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par167" class="">167</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasonable grounds is a high threshold that is met at the point where a credibly based probability replaces suspicion (<i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 166-67; <i>Baron v. Canada</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, pp. 446-47). It requires the police to point to particularized evidence to support “an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information” (<i>Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 2005 SCC 40, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 100, at para.&nbsp;114). Whether the legal standard of reasonable grounds was met on the particular facts of a given case is a question of law to be assessed on a correctness standard (<i>R. v. Shepherd</i>, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20; <i>R. v. MacKenzie</i>, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para.&nbsp;54). </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par168" class="">168</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The need to establish reasonable grounds before effecting an arrest is not a mere procedural requirement — it is a constitutional imperative. An arrest is a key investigative step on which much hinges, both for the police and for the arrestee. It triggers intrusive police powers relating to detention, interrogation, search, and the use of force. An arrest empowers police to search the individual and their immediate surroundings without requiring them to obtain a warrant or show independent reasonable and probable grounds. Police can detain arrested individuals without any review for up to 24 hours — potentially longer if a justice is unavailable (<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec503subsec1" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec503subsec1" target="_blank">, s.&nbsp;503(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>). During this prolonged detention, the police may subject the arrestee to hours on end of questioning involving forms of manipulation, including lying to the arrestee in order to extract information. This is why, in the foundational decision of <i>Storrey</i>, Cory&nbsp;J. described the reasonable grounds requirement as a vital protection necessary to safeguard citizens’ liberty and without which “even the most democratic society could all too easily fall prey to the abuses and excesses of a police state” (p.&nbsp;249). The powers an arrest affords to the police is only justifiable on the basis of demonstrating reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been committed. Absent this information, the intrusion on liberty interests tolerated in the name of the investigation of crime cannot be justified. The reasonable grounds standard is a key constitutional safeguard and it must not be watered down because of mere investigative expediency or to salvage an investigation in the face of <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>-infringing conduct. </p>

He explained his grounds for arrest in this way:</p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when I get called out, it’s called out on a suspicious death. The -- the -- there is -- it is clear that there’s a conversation between Staff Sergeant Chisholm and the medical examiner. That is important to me. I know the process that we go through and how the medical examiner or the Medical Examiner’s Office triage those type of calls. So that call coming in as suspicious is important to me. </p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:13.7pt">I know that someone is deceased at the scene, and I start getting relationships based on that. I can tell you that Brian Lambert is the caller. He identifies himself as the roommate.

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:13.7pt">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we talk about a prior altercation with roommates. So what I am looking at here, if I look at the totality, I look at the environment, I look at the violence, I look at the anger, I look at some of the vernacular that was used, I can see that both roommates were there at the time of this 911 call. I look -- I start looking at opportunity. Is there possible opportunity that Mr.&nbsp;Beaver or Mr.&nbsp;Lambert could have committed this offence? Why do I say “this offence”? I believe it to be suspicious in nature. There’s red flags all over the document.</p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:13.7pt">Now, when I look at the PIMS report and then I look at that as corroborating some of the information that I saw, I start looking at motive. I start looking at motivation. And, again, in culmination with all of the information that I am getting -- and to review, phone call from Staff Sergeant Chisholm, email from Staff Sergeant Chisholm, review of the I/Net Event Information, review of the I/Net Event Chronology, review of the PIMS report, the belief that investigatively that the victim is going to be Sutton Bowers, I believe there are subjective and objective grounds to arrest both Mr.&nbsp;Lambert and Mr.&nbsp;Beaver for murder. </p>

I explain this conclusion in the following manner. I begin by briefly commenting on the relevance of the absence of notes taken by Det.&nbsp;Vermette to the assessment of reasonable grounds. Then, I explain why the above information fails to meet the objective reasonable grounds standard. First, all of the information, in its totality, is not sufficient to meet the particularized probability required to form reasonable grounds. Second, the timeline of events in Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s testimony undermines the reasonableness of his stated belief that there was reason to believe the appellants killed Mr.&nbsp;Bowers at the time of their arrest. Third, the individual pillars of evidence relied on for the asserted grounds do not support the officer’s reasoning. </p>

Without notes, it is difficult to cross‑examine or question what is often a bare assertion by the officers that they had grounds to arrest the individual. Notes are therefore critical to checking the exercise of police power by ensuring that statements of personal belief do not go routinely or effectively unchallenged. With respect to the objective element of the test, notes provide contemporaneous documentary evidence of what information the officer actually considered at the time the decision to arrest was made. The question at this stage is whether there were objectively reasonable grounds based on the information the police <i>did </i>rely on, not what they <i>could have </i>relied on. This is to prevent <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> breaches to the extent possible by ensuring a thorough assessment is conducted before the decision to arrest is made. To do otherwise would incentivize police to make snap decisions and piece together information in an attempt to justify those decisions after-the-fact.

They exaggerated the extent and utility of the information relied upon and obscured the lack of particularized evidence grounding the stated belief. When the inflated explanations are stripped back, the reasoning is essentially that the police were called on the scene to investigate a suspicious death and the individuals who found the body had an acrimonious relationship with the deceased, in which the deceased appeared to be the aggressor.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par178" class="">178</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of the information taken together does not amount to reasonable grounds. In addition, the information in the police reports could not have made up the difference needed to ground a credibly based probability. Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s testimony indicates that most of the circumstances he relied on to form reasonable grounds were known to him before he reviewed these documents. In particular, he already knew: the homicide unit had been called out to investigate a death; the body was found face down in a pool of blood near the bottom of the stairs at the front entrance of a residence; there was a prior conflict or dispute between the deceased and his roommates; and the roommates had been brought into custody by the officers who attended at the scene. While slightly more detailed, the additional information in the police file did not significantly alter the factual matrix. Corroborating the undisputed information that the appellants and the deceased were roommates and that they had been arguing that week could not raise the level of suspicion to that of reasonable grounds to believe that the appellants had killed Mr.&nbsp;Bowers. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par179" class="">179</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the grounds asserted by Det.&nbsp;Vermette and accepted by the lower courts fail to engage with the exculpatory evidence pointing away from Mr.&nbsp;Bowers’ death being a homicide, and from the appellants being involved. In assessing whether the reasonable grounds standard is met, the police must take into account the totality of the circumstances. This means that they are not entitled to disregard exculpatory, neutral, or equivocal information unless they have good reason to believe it is unreliable (<i>R. v. Chehil</i>, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220,<i> </i>at paras. 26, 29 and 33). Here, there were serious questions relating to both the offence and the individuals. </p>

This is reflected in the trial judge’s finding that, at the time of the appellants’ detention, it was unclear whether the death was the result of a criminal offence. No further information suggesting the death was the result of a homicide was uncovered between the initial detention and the appellants’ arrests. Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s assertion that the death was “suspicious” because there were “red flags all over the document” is not the type of credible, compelling, particularized information that police can rely upon to support a reasonable belief that an offence has been committed for the purpose of justifying an arrest for murder. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par181" class="">181</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the individuals, the appellants’ connection to the death was tenuous. There was no information about the time of death suggesting that it had occurred when the appellants would have had the “opportunity” to commit the offence. It will be true in every case that a particular individual or individuals report finding the body. This fact alone does not provide evidence of an “opportunity” to commit the offence. The information known to police at the time of the arrests was that the deceased was last seen alive with an unknown man.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par182" class="">182</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in all of the history in the police file, the deceased was the aggressor in the altercations. He was the only one with a history of violence. Neither of the accused had a criminal record. The information in the PIMS report relied on to support the “motive” suggested that Mr.&nbsp;Lambert didn’t think much of the assault and did not want to involve the police, have charges laid or provide a statement. Any indication that the assault provided Mr.&nbsp;Lambert with a motive to kill was minimal. </p>

It is untenable to conclude, as the trial judge did, that the information in the PIMS report could make up the difference between the absence of reasonable suspicion to detain the appellants at the scene, and the presence of reasonable grounds to arrest them at police headquarters. </p>

On Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s own evidence, he made the decision to arrest the appellants within two minutes of learning that the appellants had been illegally detained and transported to the station. Up to this point, he had been under the mistaken impression that officers at the scene had already arrested the appellants for murder. Det.&nbsp;Vermette testified that he made the decision to arrest quickly in order to “rectify” the situation (A.R., vol. I, at p. 225). </p>

In addition, much was made in Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s testimony of the fact that the medical examiner had called the homicide unit to investigate the death, which in his view meant that the death was suspicious. The word “suspicious” was Det.&nbsp;Vermette’s own — the police reports described the death as a “sudden death”, not a suspicious one. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par188" class="">188</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For an investigator to rely on the “suspicious” nature of a death in support of reasonable grounds, this label must hold up to scrutiny on the basis of particularized, objectively verifiable information. The police, not the medical examiner, are legally trained on what the constitutional standard of reasonable grounds entails. The possibility of foul play will be true any time the homicide unit is called in to investigate a death. It is not the fact of the medical investigator calling for further investigation, but the basis on which she made that decision, that could reasonably support the belief that an offence had been committed. The medical examiner can explain to the police the information on which they believe foul play may or may not have been involved, and the police can and should use that information to inform their view of whether or not there are reasonable grounds. This appears to have happened in a phone call between the medical examiner and Det.&nbsp;Vermette at 12:35 p.m. in which she provided the details of her scene assessment. However, this occurred approximately 20&nbsp;minutes <i>after</i> he had directed Dets. Hossack and Demarino to arrest the appellants for murder. At the time of the arrests, there was no information about why the medical examiner had engaged the homicide unit and what facts or factors grounded her assessment. It could be that the medical examiner calls out the police to every<i> </i>“sudden death”, or it could be that there were particular facts about the scene that supported a belief that the death was not the result of an accident. We simply do not know. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par189" class="">189</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The information that Det.&nbsp;Vermette explained formed the basis of his decision to arrest the appellants may have given rise to a reasonable suspicion, but to accept that it formed the basis of reasonable grounds to believe that the appellants killed Mr.&nbsp;Bowers would erode the reasonable grounds standard to a level inconsistent with what is required to provide a meaningful check on the state’s investigatory powers in accordance with the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>’s requirements. While the assessment is global and does not require an isolated parsing of each particular component or a <i>prima facie</i> case to answer on each element of the offence, there must be something of substance proffered in order to meet the objective reasonable grounds standard. The police have failed to offer a substantively reasonable basis to support the asserted belief that at the time of the appellants’ arrests, there were reasonable grounds to believe they had killed Mr.&nbsp;Bowers. </p>

The connection may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a combination of the three (<i>Strachan</i>; <i>Goldhart</i>; <i>Wittwer</i>). A strict causal connection is not required (<i>R. v. Therens</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;613, at p.&nbsp;649; <i>Strachan</i>, at pp.&nbsp;1005-6).

Instead of examining the connection between the breach and the evidence holistically, the “fresh start” principle focuses on whether the police, after the breach, corrected their behaviour.

The Court in <i>Wittwer</i> found that there was no break between the manner in which the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> was breached in these two offending interrogations.

The connection between the breach and the obtaining of the evidence may be temporal, contextual, causal or a combination of the three, and the connection must be more than tenuous (<i>R. v. Plaha</i> (2004), 189 O.A.C. 376, at para.&nbsp;45, citing <i>Goldhart</i>,<i> </i>at paras.&nbsp;32‑49).

However, we expect a great deal more of police than simply refraining from purposely abusing their powers. As state actors who are empowered with extraordinary authority to detain, interrogate, and use force against members of the public in the execution of their duties, it is imperative that police conduct remains scrupulously in line with the boundaries circumscribed by constitutional standards. For this reason, a failure to abide by established principles governing police conduct is considered extremely serious conduct that would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute (<i>R. v. Kokesch</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp.&nbsp;32-33; <i>R. v. Genest</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 59, at p. 87). Indeed, conduct that is “reckless”, “negligent”, or “ignorant” should support exclusion of the evidence (<i>Grant</i>, at paras.&nbsp;74-75). Conduct does not need to be deliberate, motivated by an ulterior purpose, or involve systemic or institutional abuse in order to favour a remedy (<i>Grant</i>,<i> </i>at para.&nbsp;75; <i>R. v. Harrison</i>, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at paras.&nbsp;24-25; <i>Paterson</i>, at para.&nbsp;47; <i>Le</i>,<i> </i>at para.&nbsp;143).</p>

For conduct to be described as “good faith”, the police must have conducted themselves in a manner consistent with what they “<u>subjectively</u>, <u>reasonably</u>, and <u>non-negligently</u> believe[d] to be the law” (<i>Le</i>, at para. 147, quoting <i>R. v. Washington</i>, 2007 BCCA 540, 248 B.C.A.C. 65, at para.&nbsp;78 (emphasis added); see also <i>Paterson</i>, at para.&nbsp;44). The conduct cannot be considered “good faith” if it was based on an unreasonable error or ignorance as to the scope of police authority (<i>R. v. Buhay</i>, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para.&nbsp;59; <i>Tim</i>, at para.&nbsp;85). Failing to act in bad faith&nbsp;— for example, by knowingly or deliberately breaching the accused’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights&nbsp;— does not mean that there was good faith police conduct, unless the conduct was also reasonable and showed a genuine attempt to respect and even promote the rights guaranteed under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> (<i>Le</i>, at para.&nbsp;147).</p>

He characterized this conduct as “reckless”, but not “deliberate”, “severe”, or indicative of a “blatant disregard” for the appellants’ <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights (para.&nbsp;230). While the judge correctly found that this conduct could not be characterized as good faith and favoured exclusion, I cannot accept his conclusion that the conduct was not severe and did not show a disregard for the appellants’ <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights. Detaining the appellants under a non-existent police power simply because the officer was searching for a way to maintain control over them does exactly that. The import of his finding was that the officer was operating with an end goal other than ensuring that the necessary legal standards governing police conduct were met. This shows a disregard for the bounds of police authority to limit individual liberty through arrest and detention. It is decidedly very serious conduct.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par212" class="">212</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for Cst.&nbsp;Taylor’s decision to start questioning Mr.&nbsp;Lambert in the car before having provided him with an opportunity to speak to counsel, the judge found that the questioning was not serious or a blatant disregard for Mr.&nbsp;Lambert’s<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights. He noted that it was not an interrogation or a deliberate attempt to elicit incriminating information; Cst.&nbsp;Taylor simply asked what had happened. He described the seriousness of this conduct in the following terms (at para. 234):</p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:22.7pt">This Court cannot find Cst.&nbsp;Taylor’s question completely blameless. Although innocent on its face, and likely intended not to illicit incriminating information, Cst.&nbsp;Taylor took the risk that Mr.&nbsp;Lambert would provide incriminating evidence. In posing this question, therefore, he was negligent. But does this negligent behaviour move the breach to the more serious side of the breach spectrum? In <i>Grant</i>, McLachlin&nbsp;CJC and Charron&nbsp;J said, “‘[g]ood faith’ on the part of the police will also reduce the need for the court to disassociate itself from the police conduct”: <i>Grant</i> at para 75. This Court finds that Cst.&nbsp;Taylor was posing the question in good faith. He was not attempting to elicit evidence from Mr.&nbsp;Lambert. Rather, he was simply posing a question that might further the investigation as to how Mr.&nbsp;Bowers died. In so doing, he was negligent, but not grossly so. His behaviour would fall more to the less serious side of the spectrum.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par213" class="">213</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, it is not possible to conclude that the failure to hold off on questioning Mr.&nbsp;Lambert was a “good faith” or non-serious error. In citing para.&nbsp;75 of <i>Grant</i> for authority that good faith on the part of police will reduce the need to dissociate from police conduct, the judge unfortunately overlooked the very next sentence of that paragraph, which affirms that “negligence or wilful blindness cannot be equated with good faith”. The judge made the express finding, which is well grounded in the facts, that Cst.&nbsp;Taylor’s failure to hold off questioning demonstrated negligence in meeting the conduct required of police officers. </p>

Suberu</i>,<i> </i>2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para.&nbsp;2). The duty to hold off has long been a crucial aspect of the implementational duties required of police; once a detainee asserts their right to counsel, the police cannot compel them to partake in a process which could adversely affect the conduct of an eventual trial until that right has been exercised (<i>R. v. Prosper</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236, at p.&nbsp;269, citing <i>R. v. Ross</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p.&nbsp;12). </p>

The fact that the questioning was done in a casual manner rather than an interrogation-style in no way diminishes the seriousness of this conduct, which by the trial judge’s finding was designed to “further the investigation as to how Mr.&nbsp;Bowers died”. The question asked was designed to get a response about what happened. Whether the officer said he did not expect to receive incriminating evidence does not negate the seriousness of failing to ensure that Mr.&nbsp;Lambert obtained the legal advice he requested and had a right to receive before he was subject to police questioning. Mr.&nbsp;Lambert could have made incriminating statements in the police cruiser, and the seriousness of the police’s <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>-infringing conduct is not mitigated by the fact that he did not.</p>

He relied on the fact that Det.&nbsp;Vermette was acting in a “fluid situation”, did not “have the luxury of time and thorough consideration”, and could not be expected to undertake a complete analysis of the bases supporting his grounds like a court could do in hindsight (paras.&nbsp;232 and 240). I disagree in principle with these conclusions. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par217" class="">217</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision to arrest the appellants constituted a serious violation of their <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights. A subjective belief in reasonable grounds does not excuse the decision to arrest in order to justify continued detention in the absence of objective reasonable grounds. Undertaking a thorough analysis of whether the information known to officers at the time was enough to support a credibly based probability that the appellants had killed Mr. Bowers was thus required.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par218" class="">218</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the trial judge’s conclusion, the officers were not acting in the type of “fluid situation” that might support a finding that there was insufficient time to undertake a complete analysis of the bases supporting, and pointing away from, the grounds for arrest. There was no need to act quickly to preserve officer safety, take control of a dynamic situation, or prevent the destruction of evidence. An investigation is always “fluid” in the sense that officers continuously gather information and make decisions on the basis of that information. This does not licence them to breach the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, nor does it make any breaches less serious or excusable. Fluidity is not a reason to fail to approach the applicable legal standard with rigour. There is no reason that the police did not have the luxury of time and consideration before making a determination about whether there were reasonable grounds to arrest the appellants. </p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par219" class="">219</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the officer was right to be concerned with protecting the appellants’ <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> rights when he was presented with the circumstances of their unlawful detention, there was an equally viable alternative that would better achieve that objective in this case: releasing the appellants from custody and arresting them once there were reasonable grounds to do so. No attempts were made to inquire into the reasons why the appellants were not arrested and were instead detained under a statute that Det.&nbsp;Vermette knew did not exist and did not grant the police any detention powers. Any perceived urgency by the officers at this time was of their own making. It is not a basis for lowering the standards we expect them to uphold under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

At best, informing the appellants that they were arrested simply because they were witnesses and the police needed to determine what happened showed a lack of care towards ensuring the appellants understood the extent of the jeopardy that accompanies being arrested for murder. </p>

Not only were these breaches serious on their own, but the pattern of disregard shown by these officers over the course of the investigation further supports the conclusion that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (<i>Grant</i>, at para.&nbsp;75).

During this time, the police kept the appellants in custody, searched them, and continued their investigation to the point where they purportedly obtained sufficient grounds to arrest them for murder. They then continued to detain and interrogate them on the basis of those purported grounds until they admitted their involvement in Mr.&nbsp;Bowers’ death.

He instead focused on his findings that the appellants knew they had staged the scene of the death, from which he surmised that they knew the reasons for their detention. He also gave significant weight to his findings that the appellants would have spoken to the police no matter what because they were intent on providing their exculpatory narrative.

It could equally have been the case that the appellants gave their exculpatory narrative because they did not appreciate the seriousness of the jeopardy they faced or the implications of providing that information, or felt they had to continue with the narrative they had committed themselves to without being properly informed (see, e.g., <i>Plaha</i>, at paras.&nbsp;59-61; <i>R. v.

The messages stated that Mr.&nbsp;Bowers was “taking brian and jim down” because “they fucked [him]” (R.R., at p.&nbsp;45). Another message was sent some three hours later, stating: “I just destroyed brian and jim now I can get some worthy roommates any suggestions” (p.&nbsp;45). In the Crown’s submission, these messages further confirmed the animus between the deceased and the appellants and would have resolved any doubt about the grounds for the arrests shortly after they were originally carried out. </p>

Further, the additional information from the PIMS report establishes Mr.&nbsp;Bowers as having assaulted Mr.&nbsp;Lambert, and the report makes no mention at all of Mr.&nbsp;Beaver. In any event, even if this information were sufficient to provide objectively reasonable grounds, it would not significantly lessen the cumulative impact of the breaches on the appellants’ <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>-protected interests that led to that point. </p>

For Mr.&nbsp;Beaver, Det.&nbsp;Hossack’s reassurance that his arrest changed nothing about his circumstances — which was clearly false — heightened the impact on his <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>-protected interests.</p>

It is not clear that the Crown’s case would be “gutted” if the statements were excluded (<i>Grant</i>, at para.&nbsp;83). And while the offence is undoubtedly serious, this factor “cut[s] both ways” as the public has a heightened interest in ensuring the justice system is above reproach when the penal stakes for the accused are high (<i>Grant</i>, at para.&nbsp;84). On this point, Iacobucci J.’s comments in <i>R. v. Burlingham</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, at para.&nbsp;50,<i> </i>are apposite:</p> 
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Short-cutting or short-circuiting those rights affects not only the accused, but also the entire reputation of the criminal justice system. It must be emphasized that the goals of preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system as well as promoting the decency of investigatory techniques are of fundamental importance in applying&nbsp;<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</p>

The circumstances of the appellants’ detention and questioning led to multiple officers breaching multiple <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>rights. The police conduct was extremely serious, violating foundational <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>principles that officers have been bound for decades to follow during the course of an investigation. There were no circumstances of uncertainty in the law or urgency in handling a dynamic situation that might explain these basic errors, which fundamentally undermined the appellants’ <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>-protected interests. Given the strength of the first two <i>Grant </i>factors, society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits is insufficient to tip the balance in favour of admission (<i>Le</i>,<i> </i>at para.&nbsp;142; <i>Paterson</i>, at para.&nbsp;56).</p>

While the appellants sought an order substituting acquittals, the trial judge’s reasons indicated that the Crown may have evidence to make a case even having excluded this evidence (see ABQB<i> </i>reasons, at paras.&nbsp;251-52), and there is insufficient information in the record available at this Court to determine otherwise.</p>
