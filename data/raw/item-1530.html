The performances in question involved varying degrees of sexual contact between nude “dancers” and patrons at the tavern, including the fondling and kissing of a dancer’s breasts by patrons, mutual masturbation and apparent cunnilingus. At trial, both accused were acquitted.&nbsp; The trial judge held that M did not have the requisite criminal intent to support a conviction.&nbsp; He found that M made adequate and appropriate arrangements in hiring an entertainment director to oversee all aspects of entertainment and that there was no evidence that M knew that the table dancers were usually performing dances which might be classified as indecent.&nbsp; In any event, after reviewing the activities observed by the police in the tavern, he concluded that the performances did not exceed the Canadian community standard of tolerance and thus were not indecent.&nbsp; On appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the acquittals and convicted both accused.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Aside from the question of intent, conviction or acquittal in this case turns only on whether the performances were indecent. The appropriate test to determine indecency is the community standard of tolerance.&nbsp; A performance is indecent if the social harm engendered by the performance, having reference to the circumstances in which it took place, is such that the community would not tolerate it taking place. The relevant social harm to be considered under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec167" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;167<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is the attitudinal harm on those watching the performance as perceived by the community as a whole. Here, as found by the Court of Appeal, the conduct exceeded the standard of tolerance in contemporary Canadian society.&nbsp; The activities were indecent insofar as they involved sexual touching between dancer and patron. This type of activity ‑‑ the fondling and sucking of the dancer’s breasts by patrons, as well as contact between the dancer or patron and the other person’s genitals ‑‑ is harmful to society in many ways: it degrades and dehumanizes women; it desensitizes sexuality and is incompatible with the dignity and equality of each human being; and it predisposes persons to act in an antisocial manner.&nbsp; This analysis is sufficient to ground the finding that the performances were indecent.&nbsp; The potential harm to the performers themselves ‑‑ the risks of harm from sexually transmitted diseases and from the activities’ similarity to prostitution ‑‑ while obviously regrettable is not a central consideration under s.&nbsp;167.&nbsp; The risk of harm to the performers is only relevant insofar as that risk exacerbates the social harm resulting from the degradation and objectification of women. Finally, the physical contact between patron and dancer and the public nature of the activity are the central points distinguishing this case from <i>Tremblay</i> and <i>Hawkins</i>. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Since there is no issue in this appeal concerning E’s intent, the finding of indecency is sufficient to uphold his conviction.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal erred, however, in interfering with the trial judge’s factual finding that M did not have the requisite&nbsp; <i>mens rea</i> to support a conviction.&nbsp; Section 167 is a full <i>mens rea</i> offence.&nbsp; The requirement that an accused “allow” an indecent performance implies, at the very least,&nbsp; a requirement of concerted acquiescence on the part of the accused or wilful blindness.&nbsp; The word “allow” in this context should be equated with “knowingly” in the context of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec163subsec2" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;163(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge noted that both E and M testified that E was entirely responsible for the activity of the dancers at the tavern and found, as a fact, that M did not have actual knowledge of the activities in question.&nbsp; In overturning this finding, the Court of Appeal improperly substituted its view of the facts for that of the trial judge.&nbsp; Further, the issue of wilful blindness did not arise.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the trial judge stated that M did not have the “necessary criminal intent”, and this includes wilful blindness.&nbsp; Second, the trial judge’s finding that M had taken “reasonable steps” ‑‑ the delegation of responsibility to E ‑‑ to comply with the law precludes the possibility that he could have been found wilfully blind.&nbsp; It is possible in other circumstances that delegation in bad faith in order to protect oneself from the law rather than to ensure compliance with the law will amount to wilful blindness. Given the trial judge’s finding of fact on <i>mens rea</i>, M’s acquittal should be restored. </span></p>

No. 264 (QL).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal unanimously overturned the acquittals and entered convictions: (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 643, 88 O.A.C. 358, 133 D.L.R. (4th) 201, 105 C.C.C. (3d) 147, 46 C.R.

12.2pt">The Court seems to assume that ‘obscenity’ is a peculiar <i>genus</i> of ‘speech and press,’ which is as distinct, recognizable, and classifiable as poison ivy is among other plants.&nbsp; On this basis the <i>constitutional</i> question before us simply becomes, as the Court says, whether ‘obscenity,’ as an abstraction, is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and the question whether a <i>particular</i> book may be suppressed becomes a mere matter of classification, of ‘fact,’ to be entrusted to a fact-finder and insulated from independent constitutional judgment.&nbsp; But surely the problem cannot be solved in such a generalized fashion.&nbsp; Every communication has an individuality and ‘value’ of its own.&nbsp; The suppression of a particular writing or other tangible form of expression is, therefore, an <i>individual</i> matter, and in the nature of things every such suppression raises an individual constitutional problem, in which a reviewing court must determine for <i>itself</i> whether the attacked expression is suppressable within constitutional standards.&nbsp; Since those standards do not readily lend themselves to generalized definitions, the constitutional problem in the last analysis becomes one of particularized judgments which appellate courts must make for themselves.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">As discussed above, <i>Butler</i> set out that harm is the principle underlying the notion of what Canadians would tolerate.&nbsp; The majority stated in that case at p. 485:</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The courts must determine as best they can what the community would tolerate others being exposed to on the basis of the degree of harm that may flow from such exposure. Harm in this context means that it predisposes persons to act in an anti-social manner as, for example, the physical or mental mistreatment of women by men, or, what is perhaps debatable, the reverse. Anti‑social conduct for this purpose is conduct which society formally recognizes as incompatible with its proper functioning.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The trial judge erred, under these circumstances, in holding that the respondent Mara had acted reasonably by delegating the conduct of the performers to the respondent East, without taking any steps in his own right to prevent the indecent performances from being carried on.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The court went on to state that, in any event, “knowingly” was not found in s. 167 and that therefore the <i>mens rea</i> standard was lower.&nbsp; The court overturned the acquittal of Mara and entered a conviction.</p>
