While the burden is on the Crown to prove admissibility, the accused is in effect called upon to make a case against evidence on a factual issue that has already been resolved in his or her favour.&nbsp; The admissibility of similar fact evidence depends on balancing the probative value of the evidence against the prejudice it may cause to the accused.&nbsp; The accused, to keep the evidence out, would normally attempt to cast doubt on its probative value or show unfair prejudice. The complete protection offered by issue estoppel against having to relitigate factual issues already resolved in the accused’s favour is lacking.&nbsp; [43‑44]</span></p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[1]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have read the reasons of my colleague Justice Charron and agree with them, with the exception of their treatment of issue estoppel.&nbsp; Issue estoppel, as applied in Canada since <i>Grdic v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 810, has created perplexing difficulties and fostered calls for reform.&nbsp; That reform is required is beyond doubt.&nbsp; The only question is whether that reform should take the form of excising issue estoppel entirely from the criminal law, as my colleague contends, or whether the principle should be retained in a narrower, less problematic form.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I favour the latter approach.&nbsp; In my view, the difficulties associated with the application of issue estoppel in criminal law arise from the fact that it has been extended to circumstances where justice does not support its application. Properly confined, in accordance with a proper reading of the majority reasons in <i>Grdic</i>, issue estoppel plays an indispensable role in ensuring fairness to the accused, avoiding inconsistent verdicts and maintaining the principle of finality.&nbsp; Other concepts, such as abuse of process, character evidence rules, and the rules governing the admissibility of similar fact evidence, do not completely or effectively guarantee these goals.&nbsp; Though it shares many features with its civil law equivalent, criminal law issue estoppel is a stand‑alone doctrine responsive to the unique characteristics of criminal trials. I would therefore decline to throw out issue estoppel in its entirety.&nbsp; Rather, I would modify the current Canadian approach to issue estoppel in criminal law, confining it to the focused compass of precluding the Crown from leading evidence which is inconsistent with findings made in the accused’s favour in a previous proceeding.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying this principle to the facts in this case, I conclude that issue estoppel does not operate against the Crown.&nbsp; The accused argues that issue estoppel means that evidence admitted on his first trial, the verdict under appeal, must now be deemed to have been improperly admitted on the ground that he was acquitted on a second charge where the subject matter of the second charge was the same as the impugned evidence led at the first trial.&nbsp; In my view, this argument invokes the doctrine of issue estoppel in a manner that is overbroad.&nbsp; I agree with Blair J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal, that properly understood, issue estoppel does not operate retrospectively to require the ordering of a new trial.&nbsp; However, as a new trial is required on other grounds, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

(as he then was), took the view that “any issue, the resolution of which had to be in favour of the accused as a prerequisite to the acquittal, is irrevocably deemed to have been found conclusively in favour of the accused” (p. 825).&nbsp; Lamer J. went on to state: “This is so even though the judgment might well be the result of a reasonable doubt on that issue . . .” (p. 825). Accordingly, Lamer J. held that since identity was the central issue in the first trial in <i>Grdic</i>, and since the trial judge had a reasonable doubt about identity, the Crown was estopped from relitigating that issue (pp.&nbsp;825-26).&nbsp; In short, if an issue supporting an acquittal is resolved in favour of the accused on one offence, on whatever basis, evidence to contradict the finding on that issue cannot subsequently be re-led on different charges.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Some of the difficulty with the application of issue estoppel appears to find its genesis in a misreading of the majority in <i>Grdic</i> that the fact of an acquittal estops the Crown from relitigating <i>any</i> fact that was in issue in the first trial, whether or not it can be shown that the particular issue was decided in the accused’s favour in the first case. The basis for this extension of the principle may lie in Lamer J.’s comment in <i>Grdic</i> that “[t]here are not different kinds of acquittals” (p.&nbsp;825) — a comment made at the outset of his analysis in response to concerns about the trial judge’s comments that one of the witnesses on identity must have committed perjury.&nbsp; Lamer J.’s concern appears to have been to rebut any suggestion that the acquittal was somehow tainted or not genuine, as a result of the finding of perjury.&nbsp; It was in this context that he stated that all acquittals are equal and that one cannot go behind them.&nbsp; Lamer J. then turned to <i>res judicata</i> and issue estoppel.&nbsp; The balance of the analysis focuses, not on the acquittal, but on whether the issue of identity had been decided in the first trial.&nbsp; Lamer J. expressly affirmed that a prior acquittal on a different charge “does not mean that, for the purpose of the application of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, the Crown is estopped from re-litigating all or any of the issues raised in the first trial” (p.&nbsp;825), limiting the scope of issue estoppel to “any issue, the resolution of which had to be in favour of the accused as a prerequisite to the acquittal” (p.&nbsp;825).&nbsp; Whether the Crown was estopped was discussed as dependent, not on the fact of an acquittal in a previous proceeding, but on whether the issue in question has been decided in the accused’s favour in a previous proceeding.&nbsp; On the facts of <i>Grdic</i>, Lamer J. found that the issue of identity had been decided in favour of the accused in the first trial, based on a review of the record of the first trial, including the defence led, and the nature of the case (<i>Grdic</i>, at p.&nbsp;826).</p>

The determination of whether an issue was decided at a first trial, either expressly or necessarily as a prerequisite to an acquittal, must be based on a review of the relevant portions of the transcript of the first trial, in particular, the allegations, the nature of the Crown’s case, and the defence’s case: <i>Grdic</i>, at p.&nbsp;826.&nbsp; The accused claiming issue estoppel bears the burden of showing that a particular issue was decided in his or her favour in a previous proceeding.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798.&nbsp; In <i>Gushue</i>, the Court considered whether issue estoppel applied where the accused had been acquitted of murder in the course of a robbery involving a co-accused, and was subsequently charged with the robbery.&nbsp; This Court held that issue estoppel did not apply to prevent the robbery charge from proceeding, because different theories of liability were left to the jury at the murder trial, with the effect that the acquittal on the murder charge did not necessarily require a finding of fact that the accused had not participated in a robbery (pp.&nbsp;806-7).</p>

In my view, these propositions should be affirmed as correct statements of the law.&nbsp; Moreover, it should follow from these propositions that the Crown is permitted (absent the operation of the other rules of evidence) to lead evidence relating to issues litigated in an earlier proceeding: (1) if the issue was not decided in the accused’s favour in the earlier proceeding; and (2) if the issue was decided in the earlier proceeding, but the Crown is not seeking to use the evidence to contradict the factual finding on that issue at the previous trial.</p>

Trial judges, charged with the duty of determining whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, frequently state their findings in terms of having a reasonable doubt about an issue.&nbsp; If having a reasonable doubt on a particular issue is not held to be a conclusive finding of fact, then very few issues will fall within issue estoppel’s ambit, and the ends of finality will be poorly served.</p>

G. (K.R.)</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 268 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Rulli</i> (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 465 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2000] 1 S.C.R. xviii; <i>R. v. Verney</i> (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 363 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp; As to the first issue, as is discussed above at paras. 18-26, issue estoppel does <i>not</i> mean that every piece of evidence led in a first trial which leads to an acquittal is inadmissible in a subsequent trial on another matter.&nbsp; Only issues that were either necessarily resolved in favour of the accused as part of the acquittal, or on which findings were made (even if on the basis of reasonable doubt) are estopped.&nbsp; This would usually include the central issue in the case if it is a one-issue case, or particular issues in a multi-issue case, <i>if</i> the court at the second trial can discern from reviewing the transcript that a finding was made on a particular issue, even if on the basis of reasonable doubt.</p>

The state has the right to charge an accused and to prove the facts at a trial of the charge.&nbsp; If a judge or jury conclusively decides a fact in favour of the accused, including via a finding of a reasonable doubt on an issue, then the accused should not be required in a subsequent proceeding to answer the same allegation.&nbsp; To require, in effect, a second defence of the issue would be to violate the fundamental function of <i>res judicata</i>.</p>

British Columbia (Human Rights Commission)</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, 2000 SCC 44, at para. 120.&nbsp; To date, the doctrine has not been much used to protect against relitigation, and indeed there is authority for the proposition that relitigation, without more, simply does not reach the threshold required for a finding of abuse of process: <i>Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society v. Seddon</i>, [1999] 1 W.L.R. 1482 (C.A.), at pp.&nbsp;1492-93.&nbsp; To protect parties from relitigation, abuse of process would need to be cast in a less discretionary form than it now takes.&nbsp; Therefore, considering the high threshold for proof and the unpredictability of its operation, it is unlikely that the doctrine of abuse of process adequately achieves the fairness goal that underlies the doctrine of issue estoppel.</p>

A simple, clear rule is required to prevent issues established in one criminal proceeding from being relitigated in a subsequent proceeding.&nbsp; All would agree that an accused should not be required to defend himself against the same allegations twice; that inconsistent findings on matters of fact are abhorrent to the criminal law; and that finality and economy are important institutional values in the administration of justice.&nbsp; Adequate protection of these goals requires, at a minimum, a rule that issues determined in one criminal trial cannot be relitigated in a subsequent criminal trial.</p>

C.U.P.E., Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, 2003 SCC 63.&nbsp; The same would appear to apply at a subsequent tort trial based on the same events as a prior criminal trial where the accused was convicted.&nbsp; None of these results distort or strain the criminal law.</p>

L.Q. </i>382, at p.&nbsp;383.&nbsp; It has sometimes been understood, however, in the broader sense of requiring that the principle of issue estoppel apply to both parties in identical fashion.&nbsp; In this sense, mutuality has never been part of Canadian criminal law, which recognizes that the presumption of innocence and the requirement that the Crown must prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt trump issue estoppel.&nbsp; Where the Crown seeks to estop an accused from contesting this innocence based on decisions against the accused in prior criminal proceedings, the claim for estoppel will fail.&nbsp; To permit the Crown to rely on issue estoppel in these circumstances would offend the presumption of innocence and the requirement that the Crown in a criminal proceeding bears the burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

Humphrys</i>, [1976] R.T.R. 339 (H.L.), at p.&nbsp;349, <i>per</i> Viscount Dilhorne.&nbsp; The more circumscribed Canadian response seems entirely adequate and in my view does not support the conclusion that issue estoppel must be entirely excised from the criminal law.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>First, in the <i>Arp</i> situation, the finality concern of issue estoppel does not arise because the two (or more) matters are being tried together.&nbsp; There is no <i>prior</i> finding of fact.</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>Second, the joint trial of multiple counts raises the problem of how to charge the jury if the law were to require that the evidence of one count be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before it could be used as similar fact evidence on another count.&nbsp; The general rule from <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, that individual pieces of evidence need not be proved on the reasonable doubt standard militates against holding (and charging a jury) that the evidence of one count cannot be used as similar fact evidence on another count unless the first count is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Given the rationales for issue estoppel, the difference in result depending on the order in which charges are tried or whether they are tried together, is defensible in this context.&nbsp; The Court in <i>Arp</i> accepted this argument (at paras. 64-79) as the basis for distinguishing the multi-count indictment situation from the acquittal at a prior trial situation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

Handy</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, 2002 SCC 56, an essential step in the admissibility and use of similar fact evidence is the identification of the specific factual issue on which the evidence is probative of the improbability of coincidence.&nbsp; This may be the identity of the offender, the unlikelihood that independent witnesses would tell similar stories, or any other relevant and probative inference.&nbsp; In a multi-count indictment, the trier of fact should instruct himself, or in the case of a jury be instructed, that if the trier of fact rejects the evidence on such an issue in a particular count, then it cannot use that evidence in deciding the verdict in any other of the counts (see Stewart, at p. 396).&nbsp; Indeed, Cory&nbsp;J. suggests a similar instruction in point (6) of the model jury charge in <i>Arp</i> (para.&nbsp;80).</p>

line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB">[77]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></span>It is not necessary in this case to resolve the question of whether issue estoppel applies to situations where there is a disposition such as a stay at a first trial: see, for example, <i>R. v. Regan</i> (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 286 (N.S.S.C.); <i>Rulli</i>.&nbsp; On the one hand, cases of stays often involve determinations not based on the merits, and thus may not give rise to any factual findings (or, as Professor Stewart points in relation to entrapment, factual findings contrary to the accused may have been made, since entrapment is not even considered until after a finding of guilt has been made (pp.&nbsp;389-90)).&nbsp; On the other hand, in many cases where a stay was issued for reasons such as&nbsp; abuse of process or unreasonable delay, the factors which led to the stay may still be compelling when an attempt is made by the Crown to use the evidence at a later proceeding.&nbsp; It may well be that a more flexible approach such as abuse of process should be used for these cases, rather than issue estoppel.&nbsp; However, as this case does not engage a fact situation involving a stay of proceedings, I leave that issue for a future case.</p>

Habib Merican Noordin</i>, [1909] A.C. 615 (P.C.)&nbsp; An estoppel, however, can apply also to a single issue which may arise between two parties who, although litigating for the second time regarding issues related factually to their first case, face each other in an altogether new cause of action:&nbsp; see <i>Hoystead v.

(as he then was) stated in <i>Duhamel</i>:&nbsp; “Indeed, mutuality of issue estoppel has been excluded in criminal law because of the Crown’s burden of proving in each and every case all of the elements of the offence” (p. 562).&nbsp; <i>Duhamel</i> also illustrates how the transposition of issue estoppel into criminal law does not always accord with the rules of criminal procedure.</p>

One area where the application of issue estoppel has proven particularly unprincipled is in respect of similar fact evidence.&nbsp; Indeed, the absolute bar against admission of similar fact acquittal evidence in a subsequent criminal proceeding, as adopted by some Canadian courts, has been the subject of much academic criticism.&nbsp; See:&nbsp; L. Stuesser, “Admitting Acquittals as Similar Fact Evidence” (2002), 45 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 488; W. Gorman, “Multiple Count Indictments and the Impact of the Accused Being Acquitted on a Count Subsequently Used as Similar Fact Evidence” (1994), 30 C.R. (4th) 222; J.-G.

Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i> (4th ed. 2005), at pp. 56-57.&nbsp; The application of issue estoppel as an absolute rule precluding the admission of prior acquittal evidence in all cases regardless of context is inconsistent with the basic rule favouring the admission of all relevant evidence, subject to countervailing concerns.&nbsp; Stuesser explains (at p. 490):</p>

However, that standard does not apply to individual items of evidence:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.&nbsp; Rather, the decision on the elements of the offence, and thereby the ultimate verdict, is the result of a cumulative pooling of the individual items of evidence.&nbsp; We have already seen how the criminal burden of proof raises difficulties in identifying&nbsp; whether precise issues were determined in the prior proceeding, particularly in the case of acquittals.&nbsp; Even where the question to be estopped can be determined with sufficient precision, the burden of proof also impacts the finality requirement — again, particularly in the case of acquittals.&nbsp; Because the burden of proof in a criminal trial is beyond a reasonable doubt, a verdict of “not guilty” encompasses a broad range of circumstances, from factual innocence to proof just short of beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; To ignore this reality is to disregard a foundational aspect of our criminal law system.&nbsp; Taking account of the many shades of doubt upon which a verdict of “not guilty” could reasonably be based, however, complicates the finality assessment for the purposes of issue estoppel considerably.&nbsp; What degree of proof is required in a criminal proceeding to give rise to&nbsp; estoppel on a particular issue in a subsequent proceeding?</p>

Hanover Insurance Co.</i> (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 98 (C.A.), where the court ruled that a verdict of acquittal is not admissible in a subsequent civil trial to prove that the party did not commit the impugned act.&nbsp; As noted by Catzman J.A.

Cullen</i> (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 459 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. G. (K.R.) </i><span lang="FR-CA">(1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 268 (Ont. C.A.);<i> R. v. Verney</i> (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 363 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp; </span>Although the language in the underlined passage above is certainly suggestive of an absolute exclusionary rule, it is not to be interpreted as such, for, as <i>Grdic </i>itself admits of an exception — a hard and fast rule excluding the admission of relevant evidence underlying a prior acquittal will not serve the ends of justice in all circumstances.&nbsp; Indeed, <i>Grdic</i> notes that in appropriate circumstances fraud, such as perjury, could be set up against an accused to deny him the benefit of issue estoppel (p. 827).&nbsp; In such cases, society’s interest in prosecuting the perjurer tips the balance in favour of allowing the relitigation of an issue previously decided.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Ollis</i>, [1900] 2 Q.B. 758, the accused was charged with obtaining money by false pretences. &nbsp;He had obtained funds in exchange for a cheque that was later dishonoured.&nbsp; The accused was acquitted at his first trial on the basis that when he gave the cheque to the complainant, he expected to receive funds to cover it.&nbsp; The accused was later again indicted with obtaining money by false pretences, and at his second trial the Crown adduced the evidence of the first complainant as relevant to the accused’s guilty state of mind.&nbsp; The court held that the evidence was properly admissible.&nbsp; As Widgery J. stated in <i>G. (an infant) v. Coltart</i>, [1967] 1 All E.R. 271 (Q.B.), at p. 276:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify">. . . it may well happen that evidence relating to the charge giving rise to the acquittal will be called on the subsequent charge, but, if it is so called, it will be called because it has relevance to the subsequent charge <u>quite independently of any question whether the accused was guilty or innocent on the first charge</u>.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
200%">On the basis of this reasoning, the evidence of the prior acquittal in <i>Ollis</i> was correctly admitted.&nbsp; It was admitted to prove intent.&nbsp; Even if the accused was acquitted of the first charge, the fact that he had been tried on similar charges once before went to his knowledge of wrongdoing irrespective of his guilt on the first charge.&nbsp; The fact of his prior trial and acquittal could be admitted for this limited purpose, but would of course require a careful instruction from the trial judge.&nbsp; <u>Yet, in most situations, it will be unfair and inappropriate to admit the evidence underlying the prior acquittal as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial of the same accused.</u>&nbsp; [First and third emphasis added; second emphasis added in <i>Arp</i>.]</p>

Ollis</i>, [1900] 2 Q.B. 758, would not have any significance in the subsequent proceeding without relating some of the underlying facts.&nbsp; Therefore, as the underlined text quoted above makes apparent, the question of admissibility of prior acquittal evidence will depend, not on an absolute rule barring its admissibility in all cases, but on the careful weighing of the probative value of the evidence to an ultimate issue in the subsequent proceeding, as against the unfairness of requiring the accused to repeatedly defend himself against the same allegations on the issue in question.&nbsp; In most cases, given the importance of maintaining the integrity of the verdict in the prior proceeding, the latter will trump.&nbsp; In short, as we can recognize here, the admissibility of the evidence will be determined in accordance with the familiar similar fact evidence test.&nbsp; I will elaborate later on how the similar fact test is entirely suited to deal with questions of admissibility in this context.&nbsp; But first, I return to the analysis in <i>Arp</i>.</p>

Concern that the inherent discretion involved in the application of some of these concepts may not provide adequate protection for an accused, in my respectful view, is misplaced.&nbsp; As we have seen, issue estoppel is ultimately a discretionary exercise which itself admits of certain exceptions.&nbsp; It is true that a “simple, clear rule” guiding the application of issue estoppel in the criminal context would effectively “prevent issues established in one criminal proceeding from being relitigated in a subsequent proceeding” (Chief Justice’s reasons, at para. 47).&nbsp; However, the inherent inflexibility of an absolute rule is part of the problem.&nbsp; Consider the following example which essentially mirrors the fact situation in <i>G. (K.R.)</i>, a case which my colleague identifies at para. 33 of her reasons as exemplary of the over‑extension of the doctrine of issue estoppel.</p>

In convicting the accused, the trial judge expressly relies on the similar fact evidence of A.B.&nbsp; Subsequently, the accused is charged with sexually assaulting A.B. and is acquitted.&nbsp; The accused appeals his conviction.&nbsp; The question is whether the accused’s conviction should be overturned based on the fresh evidence of his subsequent acquittal.&nbsp; If the issue is framed in terms of issue estoppel, I would agree that the clear and simple answer is no, the conviction should not be overturned because the doctrine cannot apply retrospectively.&nbsp; Hence, an appellate court would indeed be wrong to overturn the conviction on the basis of issue estoppel.&nbsp; In my view, however, the just outcome in this scenario requires a more nuanced approach than the absolute rule of issue estoppel can provide.&nbsp; I will explain.</p>

Marc Rosenberg, now Rosenberg J.A., provided the following useful example in an article quoted to make the same point in <i>R. v. B. (L.)</i> (1997), 9 C.R. (5th) 38 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 31:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">Prejudice in this context, of course, does not mean that the evidence might increase the chances of conviction but rather that the evidence might be <i>improperly</i> used by the trier of fact. It is one thing for evidence to operate unfortunately for an accused but it is quite another matter for the evidence to operate unfairly.&nbsp; The trier who learns of the accused’s previous misconduct may view the accused as a bad man, one who deserves punishment regardless of his guilt of the instant offence and may be less critical of the evidence presently marshalled against him.&nbsp; [Emphasis in original.]</p>
