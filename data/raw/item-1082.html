Such an order does not govern the conduct of the parties but rather regulates the judicial process itself.&nbsp; Allowing&nbsp; a collateral attack at trial on such an order would not jeopardize the rule of law or damage the repute of the administration of justice.&nbsp; Indeed the order would have been subject to review by appellate courts along with the verdict if it had been made by a trial judge.&nbsp; Procedure cannot govern substance ‑‑ an order so erroneous that it results in a fundamentally flawed trial process cannot be allowed to stand.</span></p>

Chase</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, which decided that sexual assault is a crime of general intent and that the Crown did not have to prove a specific intent with respect to the sexual nature of the assault.&nbsp; As McIntyre J. wrote for the Court at p. 302:</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, <i>per</i> McIntyre J., at p. 599).&nbsp; The lack of jurisdiction which would oust the rule against collateral attack would be a lack of capacity in the court to make the type of order in question, such as a provincial court without the power to issue injunctions.&nbsp; However, where a judge, sitting as a member of a court having the capacity to make the relevant type of order, erroneously exercises that jurisdiction, the rule against collateral attack applies.&nbsp; See, e.g., <i>B.C.

Chabot,</i> [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, commented in <i>obiter dicta</i> at p. 1000 that the preferral of the indictment occurs and the trial begins when the accused is called upon to plead "before a trial court constituted to dispose of the case".&nbsp; In the case at bar, that occurred only sometime after McDonald J. had made his severance order.&nbsp; Had the judge who presided over the trial proper, Hope J., made the severance order, as happens elsewhere in some parts of Canada, it would have been appealable as part of the proceedings in the trial.&nbsp; The difficulty is that the order was made before trial by another judge before, it is argued, the indictment was preferred.&nbsp; Since no appeal was (or could be) taken from that order, it stands, by virtue of the rule against collateral attack: See <i>Wilson v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594.&nbsp; My colleague concludes that to meet this argument, it is necessary to entertain an exception to the rule against collateral attack so that substance may triumph over form.</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The English word "To prefer" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary&nbsp; as follows: "To lay (a matter) before anyone formally for consideration, approval, or sanction; to bring forward, present, submit (a statement, bill, indictment, information, prayer, etc.)". In the French version the verb used is "presenter".&nbsp; This word incorporates a similar idea of placing something before a Court for consideration and action.... [T]he indictment is presented to the Court, the Court accepts or rejects it; if it is accepted, as is usually the case, it is read to the accused and he is called upon to plead to it.&nbsp; That, in my view, completes preferment.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The preferment was historically effected when a bill of indictment was presented to and returned by a grand jury.&nbsp; This typically occurred at the point when the judge and jury were in place, ready to hear the case, as described in <i>Chabot. </i>&nbsp;In provinces such as Alberta, where there have never been grand juries, it is done by the Attorney General or his or her agent: see Salhany, <i>Canadian Criminal Procedure</i> (1989), at p. 182.&nbsp; This has often occurred prior to the time when a judge and jury ready to hear the evidence were in place.&nbsp; In short, the time when the indictment is preferred and the trial proceedings begin is a matter of historical incident and practice, rather than one of principle.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewing the matter thus, I incline to the view that the order of McDonald J. occurred after preferment of the indictment and commencement of the trial proceedings and should be regarded as part of the trial.&nbsp; As such, it is appealable.&nbsp; In the alternative, if I were to proceed from the premise that the order of McDonald J. preceded the preferment of the indictment and was not part of the trial, I agree with my colleague that there should be an exception to the rule against collateral attack where the Alberta procedure outlined above has been followed.&nbsp; To do otherwise would be to insulate severance orders by Alberta courts against appeals which could be brought in other parts of the country where the judge who actually presides at the trial makes the order.&nbsp; That would be manifestly unjust.</span></p>
