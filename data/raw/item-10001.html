The first relates to the nature of the offence of kidnapping.&nbsp; The appellant submits that kidnapping is not a continuing offence, in other words, that kidnapping ends the moment the victim is seized and carried away, at which point the offence of unlawful confinement begins.&nbsp; Only this ensuing phase of confinement, the appellant argues, is a continuing offence.&nbsp; The Crown maintains that kidnapping is an ongoing offence that continues from the time the victim is apprehended and carried away until the time he or she is freed (or otherwise consents to being detained).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue is tied to the first and need only be addressed if kidnapping is found to be a continuing offence.&nbsp; Specifically, it concerns the liability of persons who, while not involved in the victim’s apprehension, decide to participate in the ensuing confinement of the victim with full knowledge that the victim has been kidnapped — in other words, persons who willingly and knowingly choose to join the kidnapping enterprise.&nbsp; Do such latecomers become parties to the offence of kidnapping under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec21subsec1" target="_blank">s. 21(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, as the Crown maintains, or are they solely liable for the offence of unlawful confinement, as the appellant contends?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, I am not persuaded that Parliament intended to restrict the offence of kidnapping to the victim’s initial taking and movement, while leaving the victim’s ensuing captivity to the comparably less serious crime of unlawful confinement.&nbsp; On the contrary, I am satisfied that Parliament intended to include the offence of unlawful confinement in the offence of kidnapping so as to capture, under the crime of kidnapping, the victim’s ensuing captivity.&nbsp; Therefore, while the crime of kidnapping may be complete in law when the victim is initially apprehended and moved, the crime will not be complete in fact until the victim is freed.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [t]he accidental occurrence of such a combination of events and items would require a confluence of coincidences too fantastic to be reasonably possible.&nbsp; There is no rational inference that can be drawn from the evidence other than that <u>[the appellant] was involved, with full knowledge, in the wrongdoing against [Mr.] McMynn</u>.&nbsp; I am satisfied of that beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 369.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">While the remark that the appellant “was involved, with full knowledge, in the wrongdoing against [Mr.] McMynn” would seem clear, it is accepted for present purposes that it is not to be taken as a finding that the appellant either participated in Mr. McMynn’s initial taking or knew of it at the time it occurred.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was found to have taken part in Mr. McMynn’s confinement in each of the three houses.&nbsp; The evidence further established that he was involved in the purchase of a tarp and duct tape four days before Mr. McMynn’s rescue.&nbsp; He and a co-accused were also found to have discussed the issue of ransom in Mr. McMynn’s presence and to have threatened to kill Mr. McMynn if the ransom was not paid.&nbsp; Finally, the appellant was arrested in the third house when the police rescued Mr. McMynn from his eight-day ordeal.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is evidence connecting [the appellant] to all three houses, I am not satisfied that the evidence indicates that he had anything more than knowledge about the movement of [Mr.] McMynn.&nbsp; [para. 375]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">In the trial judge’s view, knowledge of these movements alone was not sufficient to find the appellant guilty of kidnapping.&nbsp; Therefore, he acquitted the appellant on that count.</p>

Hochheimer, <i>The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure</i> (2nd ed. 1904), at § 317 cited in <i>Midgett</i>, at p. 215.&nbsp; As J. L. Diamond explains in his study of the offence:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial common law element of carrying a victim out of the country&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. emphasized that the victim would almost inevitably suffer a very lengthy, if not permanent, isolation from his or her normal society.&nbsp; <u>From this perspective, kidnapping was an extreme form of false imprisonment because the isolation was often for the duration of the victim’s life.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 31.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Movement is insidious because it removes the victim from his or her normal surroundings.&nbsp; Locating the victim becomes that much more difficult.&nbsp; The police are deprived of the clues about the victim’s whereabouts that are generally available in straightforward cases of unlawful confinement.&nbsp; When a kidnapping occurs, the range of possible locations where the victim might be held captive increases exponentially and the likelihood that the victim will be found and rescued diminishes accordingly.&nbsp; In that sense, movement is tied to the ensuing confinement and the eventual location where the victim is secreted and held captive.&nbsp; This argues in favour of treating kidnapping as a continuing offence.&nbsp; It supports the time-honoured view that kidnapping, in its essence, is simply an aggravated form of unlawful confinement.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither <i>Reid</i> nor [other case law] supports the proposition that a taking ceases to be a taking at the moment that the kidnapper becomes criminally liable for the offence.&nbsp; <u>The offence might at that moment be complete in law, because the taking has been completed for the purposes of proving the offence, but it is not necessarily complete in fact.</u>&nbsp; Once it has been established that a person has been “taken”, in the sense that he or she has been compelled to go where he or she did not want to go, the “taking” continues until the compulsion ceases.&nbsp; It does not cease merely because the person has been taken for a certain distance or for a certain time or even because the kidnapper has ceased to physically move the victim and has commenced detaining that person in the one place.&nbsp; In a real sense, the kidnapper is taking the victim, that is causing the victim to accompany him or her, for the entire duration of the time, however long it is, that the victim is, as a result of the kidnapper’s conduct, involuntarily detained in a place that is not the place where the victim was first detained.&nbsp; <u>The taking begins with the detention and asportation of the victim, and only ends when the victim is released or ceases to withhold consent to the detention.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 64.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasoning in <i>Davis </i>is persuasive on this point, even though it relies in part on the specific wording of the kidnapping section in the New South Wales<i> Crimes Act 1900</i>.&nbsp; The decision is instructive for another reason.&nbsp; As Howie J. observed, drawing a line between seizure and detention is difficult and artificial, “particularly in cases where the victim is transported repeatedly from one place to another rather than simply held in one place” (para. 57).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant argues that this Court’s decision in <i>Bell v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 471, supports his position that kidnapping is not a continuing offence.&nbsp; With respect, I do not agree.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue in <i>Bell</i> was whether the crime of importing narcotics into Canada under s. 5 of the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, is complete once the narcotic has crossed the border or whether the crime continues until the narcotic has reached its intended final destination in Canada.&nbsp; McIntyre J., writing for a majority of the Court, concluded that the word “import” in s. 5 should be given its ordinary meaning, which “is simply to bring into the country or to cause to be brought into the country” (p. 489).&nbsp; It followed, in his view, that the offence of importing was “complete when the goods enter the country” (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice McIntyre offered some examples of offences that he considered to be “continuing” offences.&nbsp; After observing that murder was not a continuing offence but that conspiracy to commit murder could be, he stated the following:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theft is not a continuing offence.&nbsp; It is terminated when the wrongful taking has occurred with the requisite intention.&nbsp; On the other hand, possession of goods knowing them to have been obtained by the commission of theft is a continuing offence.&nbsp; <u>The offence of kidnapping would not be a continuing offence, but that of wrongful detention of the victim following the kidnapping would be.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 488.]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, <i>Bell</i> does not assist the appellant.&nbsp; Much as the appellant seeks to rely on McIntyre J.’s observation that kidnapping is not a continuing offence, that observation is not authoritative.&nbsp; The offence of kidnapping was not before the Court.&nbsp; McIntyre J. did not discuss the essential features of kidnapping, nor did he cite any supporting case law.&nbsp; McIntyre J. merely used the offence of kidnapping as an example.&nbsp; As such, this observation is <i>obiter</i>.&nbsp; (See <i>R. v. Henry</i>, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 57).</p>

Thatcher</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at pp. 689-90.&nbsp; As this Court recently explained in <i>R. v.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the well-established principles of s. 21(1) criminal liability apply with equal force to continuing offences that have been completed in law but not in fact.&nbsp; In particular, where an accused — with knowledge of the principal’s intention to see a continuing offence through to its completion — does (or omits to do) something, with the intention of aiding or abetting the commission of the ongoing offence, party liability is established.</p>

Hijazi </i>(1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 183 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Whynott</i> (1975), 12 N.S.R. (2d) 231 (S.C. (App. Div.));<b> </b><i>R. v. Tanney</i> (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 445 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp; In <i>Bell</i>, the majority cast doubt on these decisions by adopting a narrow construction of the term “import” in s. 5 of the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>.&nbsp; But the majority decision in <i>Bell</i> does not detract from the general principle articulated in the case law that a person who chooses to engage in a continuing offence with full knowledge of the offence can be held responsible as party to that offence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec21subsec1" target="_blank">s. 21(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To “actually commit” importing, an accused must bring in, or cause to be brought in, to Canada, goods from a foreign country; this, by definition, necessitates crossing the Canadian border.&nbsp; <u>Someone who becomes involved only after the border crossing, however, may be aiding and abetting a person bringing the goods from outside Canada to a given destination inside Canada.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added; pp. 478-79.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Therefore, although not a party at the time the offence was initiated (by the principal(s)), a person may become a party to the offence as long as the offence is not “over and done with”.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[65]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case illustrates why it would be incongruous to view the worst part of Mr. McMynn’s ordeal (his eight days in captivity) as a separate and less serious offence than the ordeal he underwent in the few moments it took for his captors to apprehend and remove him from his usual surroundings.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence in this regard, as found by the trial judge, is overwhelming.&nbsp; First, the appellant was present in all three houses in which Mr. McMynn was held captive.&nbsp; Second, the appellant was one of Mr. McMynn’s captors and was aware that Mr. McMynn was being held with a view to obtaining a ransom.&nbsp; Indeed, the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant and one of his co-accused had threatened to kill Mr. McMynn if the ransom was not paid.&nbsp; Third, the appellant had purchased duct tape and a tarp four days before the police rescued Mr. McMynn.&nbsp; Fourth, the appellant was arrested in the third confinement house when the police eventually freed Mr. McMynn.&nbsp; Finally, while the trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant had physically moved Mr. McMynn from house to house during the period of confinement, he did find that the appellant had full knowledge of those movements.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge nevertheless acquitted the appellant of kidnapping because he considered movement to be an essential element of kidnapping and was not satisfied that the appellant had physically participated in moving Mr. McMynn from house to house to justify a guilty verdict for kidnapping (paras. 3, 345 and 375).&nbsp; With respect, I cannot agree.&nbsp; Movement, of course, is what distinguishes kidnapping from unlawful confinement and makes kidnapping an aggravated form of unlawful confinement.&nbsp; But kidnapping, as discussed above, is a continuing offence.&nbsp; It began when <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">Mr. McMynn </a>was abducted by force from his car and ended when he was freed.&nbsp; Mr. McMynn was not kidnapped and confined at house 1, then kidnapped again upon being moved to house 2 and then kidnapped a third time upon being moved to house 3.&nbsp; To treat what occurred here as three separate kidnappings and three separate cases of unlawful confinement is, in my respectful view, illogical and further underscores why kidnapping should be treated as a continuing offence.</p>
