24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In determining whether the trier of fact could reasonably have reached the conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, a court of appeal must re‑examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence.&nbsp; This applies to verdicts based on findings of credibility.&nbsp; The test is whether a jury or judge properly instructed and acting reasonably could have convicted.&nbsp; In applying this test the appeal court should show great deference to findings of credibility made at trial.&nbsp; While the Court of Appeal thus did not err in this case in re‑examining and reweighing the evidence, it did err in setting aside the convictions.&nbsp; The law concerning the evidence of children has undergone two major changes in recent years.&nbsp; First, the notion, found at common law and codified in legislation, that the evidence of children was inherently unreliable and therefore to be treated with special caution has been eliminated.&nbsp; Thus various provisions requiring that a child's evidence be corroborated have been repealed.&nbsp; Second, there is a new appreciation that it may be wrong to apply adult tests for credibility to the evidence of children.&nbsp; While the evidence of children is still subject to the same standard of proof as the evidence of adult witnesses in criminal cases, it should be approached not from the perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on a common sense basis, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses which characterize the evidence offered in the particular case.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal went too far in this case in finding lacunae in the evidence which did not exist and in applying a stringent, critical approach to the evidence.&nbsp; It appears to have been influenced by the old stereotypes relating to the inherent unreliability of children's evidence and the "normal" behaviour of victims of sexual abuse and to have placed insufficient weight on the trial judge's findings of credibility.&nbsp; The verdicts in this case were ones which a properly instructed jury (or judge), acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.</span></p>

The King</i>, [1947] S.C.R. 268, at p. 272; <i>R. v. M. (S.H.)</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446, at pp. 465-66. The trial judge has the advantage, denied to the appellate court, of seeing and hearing the evidence of witnesses.&nbsp; However, as a matter of law it remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Before turning to the particular errors alleged, I pause to consider the general question of how courts should approach the evidence of young children.&nbsp; The law affecting the evidence of children has undergone two major changes in recent years.&nbsp; The first is removal of the notion, found at common law and codified in legislation, that the evidence of children was inherently unreliable and therefore to be treated with special caution. Thus, for example, the requirement that a child's evidence be corroborated has been removed: s. 586 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, which prohibited the conviction of a person on the uncorroborated evidence of a child testifying unsworn, was repealed by <i>An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act</i>, S.C. 1987, c. 24, s. 15, effective January 1, 1988. Similar provisions of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, and <i>Young Offenders Act</i>, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 110, have also been eliminated. The repeal of provisions creating a legal requirement that children's evidence be corroborated does not prevent the judge or jury from treating a child’s evidence with caution where such caution is merited in the circumstances of the case.&nbsp; But it does revoke the assumption formerly applied to all evidence of children, often unjustly, that children’s evidence is always less reliable than the evidence of adults.&nbsp; So if a court proceeds to discount a child’s evidence automatically, without regard to the circumstances of the particular case, it will have fallen into an error.</span></p>

<div class="Section15">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The second change in the attitude of the law toward the evidence of children in recent years is a new appreciation that it may be wrong to apply adult tests for credibility to the evidence of children.&nbsp; One finds emerging a new sensitivity to the peculiar perspectives of children.&nbsp; Since children may experience the world differently from adults, it is hardly surprising that details important to adults, like time and place, may be missing from their recollection.&nbsp; Wilson J. recognized this in <i>R. v. B. (G.)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 54-55, when, in referring to submissions regarding the court of appeal judge's treatment of the evidence of the complainant, she said that </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">... it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that the judiciary should take a common sense approach when dealing with the testimony of young children and not impose the same exacting standard on them as it does on adults. However, this is not to say that the courts should not carefully assess the credibility of child witnesses and I do not read his reasons as suggesting that the standard of proof must be lowered when dealing with children as the appellants submit.&nbsp; Rather, he was expressing concern that a flaw, such as a contradiction, in a child's testimony should not be given the same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an adult. I think his concern is well founded and his comments entirely appropriate. While children may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it. In recent years we have adopted a much more benign attitude to children's evidence, lessening the strict standards of oath taking and corroboration, and I believe that this is a desirable development. The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts must, of course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the "reasonable adult" is not necessarily appropriate in assessing the credibility of young children.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">As Wilson J. emphasized in <i>B. (G.)</i>, these changes in the way the courts look at the evidence of children do not mean that the evidence of children should not be subject to the same standard of proof as the evidence of adult witnesses in criminal cases.&nbsp; Protecting the liberty of the accused and guarding against the injustice of the conviction of an innocent person require a solid foundation for a verdict of guilt, whether the complainant be an adult or a child.&nbsp; What the changes do mean is that we approach the evidence of children not from the perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on what Wilson J. called a "common sense" basis, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses which characterize the evidence offered in the particular case.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:

Every person giving testimony in court, of whatever age, is an individual, whose credibility and evidence must be assessed by reference to criteria appropriate to her mental development, understanding and ability to communicate. But I would add this. In general, where an adult is testifying as to events which occurred when she was a child, her credibility should be assessed according to criteria applicable to her as an adult witness. Yet with regard to her evidence pertaining to events which occurred in childhood, the presence of inconsistencies, particularly as to peripheral matters such as time and location, should be considered in the context of the age of the witness at the time of the events to which she is testifying.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Against this background, I turn to a more particular consideration of the Court of Appeal's treatment of the evidence in this case.&nbsp; First, the Court referred to the fact that "there was really no confirmatory evidence".&nbsp; This suggests that the Court may have been applying the old rule that the evidence of a child could not found a conviction unless it was confirmed or corroborated by independent evidence.&nbsp; It may be that in considering the whole of the evidence in accordance with the <i>Yebes</i> test, a court of appeal will take into account, along with other factors, the presence or absence of confirmatory evidence.&nbsp; So the reference to lack of confirmatory evidence is not in itself an error of law.&nbsp; But standing as it does as a bald proposition unrelated to a detailed examination of the evidence, it does support the submission that the Court of Appeal was treating the evidence of the children as being inherently less reliable than adult evidence might be.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In any event, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that there was no supporting evidence.&nbsp; As the trial judge noted, B.W.'s allegation that the respondent took her into the family's van on a camping trip, and once inside the van, indecently assaulted her, was confirmed to some extent by the evidence of her aunt and S.W., both of whom recalled the respondent taking B.W. to the van on such an outing. In addition, the testimony of M.W. may be considered to support that of S.W. with respect to the wrestling incident S.W. alleged. Although M.W.'s description of the respondent's actions on that occasion differed from S.W.'s, her testimony still confirmed that of S.W. in a number of particulars.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
</div> <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>
<div class="Section18">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Court of Appeal next referred to the fact that the evidence of the younger children was fraught with inaccuracy.&nbsp; This is true, particularly with respect to B.W.'s evidence.&nbsp; Some of the inconsistencies are minor, for example an error on the distance from a van to a ball game many years ago.&nbsp; Others are more significant, relating to the sleeping arrangements of the three children, the location of bedrooms in the house and possibly the respondent's nighttime attire.&nbsp; While it was the proper task of the Court of Appeal to consider such inconsistencies, one finds no mention of the fact that the trial judge was alive to them and resolved them to his satisfaction in his reasons for judgment, nor of the fact that many of the inconsistencies may be explained by reference to the fact that a young child might not be paying particular attention to sleeping arrangements or clothing or that the children had lived in a variety of different arrangements, which might well have given rise to confusion on such details.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Finally, the Court of Appeal relied on the fact that neither of the older children was "aware or concerned that anything untoward occurred which is really the best test of the quality of the acts."&nbsp; This reference reveals reliance on the stereotypical but suspect view that the victims of sexual aggression are likely to report the acts, a stereotype which found expression in the now discounted doctrine of recent complaint.&nbsp; In fact, the literature suggests the converse may be true; victims of abuse often in fact do not disclose it, and if they do, it may not be until a substantial length of time has passed.&nbsp; In any event, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that there was no complaint. In fact the two older girls did complain to their mother; S.W. about the respondent getting into bed with her, and both M.W. and S.W., it would seem, about the way in which he wrestled with them.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In summary, the Court of Appeal was right to be concerned about the quality of the evidence and correct in entering upon a re-examination and reweighing, to some extent, of the evidence.&nbsp; It went too far, however, in finding lacunae in the evidence which did not exist and in applying too critical an approach to the evidence, an approach which appears to have placed insufficient weight on the trial judge's findings of credibility, influenced as the Court of Appeal appears to have been by the old stereotypes relating to the inherent unreliability of children's evidence and the "normal" behaviour of victims of sexual abuse.</span></p>
