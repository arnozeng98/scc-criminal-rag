Guthrie</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 73 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. White</i> (1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Osolin</i>, <i>supra</i>; and <i>R. v. Livermore</i> (1994), 18 O.R.

M. (M.L.)</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 3).&nbsp; Taken together with passive behaviour by the complainant, earlier acts, gestures or incidents may in certain cases colour the accused's perception of the complainant's behaviour, and serve as relevant evidence in assessing the existence or air of reality of an honest but mistaken belief in actual consent.&nbsp; Those acts and gestures may form part of a broader context or continuum which is necessary to understand the accused's honest perception of the complainant's behaviour at the time of the alleged assault. </span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570).&nbsp; In her view, no person, reasonable or otherwise, could have honestly inferred consent from the circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that the complainant may have passively acquiesced at certain points.&nbsp; In such instances, the absence of an air of reality to the defence of honest mistake precludes it from being put to the jury.</span></p>

Robertson</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, are illustrative of this fact.&nbsp; The complainant testified that the accused, a stranger, entered the apartment she shared with her room-mate under the pretence that he was a friend of the room-mate.&nbsp; Once in the apartment, he put his hand over the complainant's mouth, pulled her hair, forced her to the floor, threatened her, hit her, and sexually assaulted her.&nbsp; She did not resist the attack as she was afraid that he would hurt her more.&nbsp; At trial, defence counsel argued consent and, alternatively, honest belief as to consent.&nbsp; The accused did not testify.&nbsp; He made only the bare, unsupported assertion through his counsel that he honestly believed that the complainant was consenting.&nbsp; He did not contradict through his own testimony the version told by the complainant but rather sought to point out inconsistencies in her testimony through cross-examination.&nbsp; This cross-examination did not, however, succeed in bringing the complainant's evidence materially into dispute.&nbsp; Nor was there other evidence which brought that evidence materially into dispute.&nbsp; As such, the accused's case regarding mistaken belief amounted to little more than a bare, unsupported assertion and it was clearly, logically inconsistent with the totality of the evidence that was not materially in dispute (including, in this case, the complainant's evidence).&nbsp; It is difficult to see how the outcome would be any different if the accused had actually testified yet still only made a bare, unsupported assertion as to belief in consent without materially disputing those portions of the complainant's story relevant to the actual sexual assault.</span></p>

Vandervort argues in "Mistake of Law and Sexual Assault: Consent and Mens Rea" (1987-88), 2 <i>C.J.W.L.</i> 233, at p. 267, that consent must be regarded from the standpoint of communication, rather than from the standpoint of a private mental state:</span></p>

(M.L.)</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; By way of another example, evidence of past sexual behaviour between the parties might be relevant to the defence of mistake of fact in instances where that behaviour may have influenced the accused's honest perception of the complainant's communication relating to the particular sexual activity in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
