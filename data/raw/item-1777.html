A dissent on the issue of whether the verdict was reasonable is a dissent on a question of law, whether the dissent is based on the articulation of the applicable test or on its actual application to the particular circumstances of the case.&nbsp; The proper test is ‚Äúwhether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered‚Äù.&nbsp; In embarking on the exercise mandated by s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(i), the reviewing court must engage in a thorough re‚Äëexamination of the evidence and bring to bear the weight of its judicial experience to decide whether, on all the evidence, the verdict was a reasonable one.&nbsp; It is not sufficient for the reviewing court to simply take a different view of the evidence than the trier of fact.&nbsp; Nor is it sufficient for the court of appeal to refer to a vague unease, or a lingering or lurking doubt based on its own review of the evidence.&nbsp; While a ‚Äúlurking doubt‚Äù may be a powerful trigger for thorough appellate scrutiny of the evidence, it is not, without further articulation of the basis for such doubt, a proper basis upon which to interfere with the findings of the trier of fact.&nbsp; Rather, the appeal court, if it is to overturn the verdict, must articulate the basis upon which it concludes that the verdict is inconsistent with the requirements of a judicial appreciation of the evidence. </span></p>

The trial judge thoroughly canvassed all the evidence adduced on the issue of intent in her charge to the jury.&nbsp; There is nothing in the compendium of accumulated judicial experience that should cause concern that the jury went astray in its review and assessment of the evidence.&nbsp; Even though it might have been reasonable for the jury to conclude otherwise, it was perfectly reasonable for the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had acted with the requisite intent for murder.&nbsp; In light of his responsibility as a party, the fact that the specific blows inflicted by the accused were not the ones which were the immediate cause of death was of no significance.&nbsp; In overturning the verdict of the jury as unreasonable, the majority of the Court of Appeal was also concerned about the change in the Crown‚Äôs theory of the case and the jury‚Äôs ability to appreciate the nuances of all of this, as well as about the fact that the case was ‚Äúhighly emotional by reason of these outrageous assaults‚Äù.&nbsp; The concerns of the majority of the Court of Appeal were insufficient to set aside the verdict of the jury as unreasonable.&nbsp; They were more than adequately addressed by the trial judge, whose charge to the jury was instructive and fair.&nbsp; The verdict was one that this properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered, and it should be restored.</span></p>

Niven said not to do heroin because ‚Äúit fucked up your head‚Äù.&nbsp; Stark became angry and tensions mounted as Stark and Niven stood facing each other near the entrance to the store.&nbsp; According to Kaven Valin, shortly after the initial exchange between Stark and Niven, the respondent Biniaris, who was now standing beside Niven, told him to ‚Äúmake a move‚Äù.&nbsp; Stark threatened Niven, saying things such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fuckin cut a hole in your head‚Äù and ‚ÄúGo in.&nbsp; Save yourself‚Äù.&nbsp; At that point, Stark and Niven grabbed each other.&nbsp; The events which followed lasted only 20 to 30 seconds.&nbsp; According to Kaven Valin, Stark threw Niven into the store‚Äôs plate glass window, causing Niven to hit his head against the window.&nbsp; Stark then spun Niven around quickly and forcefully pushed him to the ground, causing Niven to strike the back of his head on the pavement.&nbsp; Once Niven was on the ground, Stark straddled Niven‚Äôs thighs and started punching him in the stomach with a closed right fist while holding down Niven‚Äôs right arm with his left hand.&nbsp; At this point, and for the next five to ten seconds, the respondent Biniaris entered the fray.&nbsp; Peter Lehtonen testified that he thought he saw the respondent inflict a ‚Äúmedium strength‚Äù kick to the middle of Niven‚Äôs back just as he was attempting to raise his head and upper body off the ground by holding onto Stark‚Äôs jacket sleeves.&nbsp; He said the kick startled Niven and caused him to fall back to the ground.&nbsp; Lehtonen also testified that he thought he saw the respondent kick Niven on the top part of the head with ‚Äúmedium‚Äù force.&nbsp; Kaven Valin did not testify to any kicks.&nbsp; He saw the respondent run toward Niven and jump ‚Äúhard‚Äù on the latter‚Äôs forehead roughly five times using his right foot, taking two or three steps back and forth in between jumps.&nbsp; The respondent stomped or jumped with sufficient force to leave tread marks from his shoes on Niven‚Äôs forehead. &nbsp;Lehtonen saw only two stationary up and down stomps, but he left the scene prior to the end of the attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the attack, the respondent Biniaris and Stark fled together.&nbsp;</p>

Kirkness</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 74, 60 C.C.C.

McIntyre J., speaking for a unanimous six-member panel of the Court, indicated that although the respondent Crown had raised that jurisdictional issue, it was not ‚Äústrongly pressed‚Äù at the hearing of the appeal (p. 181).&nbsp; McIntyre J. recognized that although the proper qualification of the issue as either one of law, fact, or mixed fact and law was far from self-evident, there was no reason to treat it differently from the similar issue of whether a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred, within the meaning of s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii).&nbsp; That having been interpreted as a question of law in <i>Mahoney v.

The determination of the reasonableness of the verdict is therefore an original decision by the court of appeal, and there is no reason to bar the possibility of a review of that important decision.&nbsp;</p>

Jensen</i> (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 430 (Ont. C.A.), appeal quashed, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 304; <i>R. v. Osvath</i> (1996), 87 O.A.C. 274 (C.A.), appeal quashed, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 7; <i>R. v. Hamilton</i>, [1997] Q.J. No. 67 (QL) (C.A.), appeal quashed June 2, 1997, [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 105 (QL).&nbsp; The quashing of these appeals, which implies an absence of jurisdiction rather than a disposition of the appeal on the merits, could be viewed as a proper application of <i>Yebes</i>.&nbsp; Arguably, <i>Yebes</i> left open the possibility that some dissents in appellate courts on the unreasonableness of a verdict may not amount to dissents on a question of law.&nbsp; After referring to the difficulty in drawing a clear line between a question of fact and one of law, and in response to the argument advanced by the Crown in that case that there was no point of law dividing the majority and the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, McIntyre J. said, at p. 181:</p>

When a conviction is said to be unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence, it is that conclusion itself that raises a question of law, not merely the process by which the conclusion was reached.&nbsp; Therefore, there is no need to determine whether that conclusion was arrived at by the application of the wrong legal test, or otherwise tainted by a legal irregularity, since even when it applies the right test, in an error-free process, the court of appeal must be right, as a matter of law, on the legal appreciation of the verdict as a reasonable one.&nbsp; This approach is also consistent with the need for clarity in jurisdictional matters.&nbsp; There certainly would be little judicial economy in embarking upon a characterization of the appellate exercise as one of fact, rather than law, as a threshold determination of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Rather than streamlining or reducing appeals, it would add to their litigiousness, but on the wrong question.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The review for unreasonableness on appeal is different, however, and somewhat easier when the judgment under attack is that of a single judge, at least when reasons for judgment of some substance are provided.&nbsp; In those cases, the reviewing appellate court may be able to identify a flaw in the evaluation of the evidence, or in the analysis, that will serve to explain the unreasonable conclusion reached, and justify the reversal.&nbsp; For example, in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Burke</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, this Court was in a position to identify the deficiencies in the trial judge‚Äôs analysis of the evidence which led to her unreasonable conclusions in respect of the three counts of indecent assault facing the accused.&nbsp; In that case, Sopinka J. found that the trial judge had ignored the possibility of collusion or corroboration between witnesses before accepting their ‚Äústrikingly similar‚Äù evidence, had not been alive to circumstances (i.e., the absence of physical traces of an alleged indecent assault which, if true, should have left observable marks) which caused great concern about the reliability of evidence adduced in support of allegations of a bizarre nature, and had relied uncritically on unorthodox identification evidence.&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>R. v. Reitsma</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 769, rev‚Äôg (1997), 97 B.C.A.C. 303, this Court agreed with Rowles J.A., dissenting, that the trial judge had failed to advert to deficiencies in the pre-trial identification procedure and the shortcoming of ‚Äúin-dock‚Äù identification.&nbsp; Finally, in<i> R. v. O‚ÄôConnor</i> (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 487 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 492-93 and 518-20, the trial judge accepted the accused‚Äôs evidence that he was not present at the place where the offence was alleged to have been committed, and yet convicted the accused.&nbsp; This logical inconsistency was relied upon by the Court of Appeal to explain the unreasonableness of the verdict.&nbsp; These examples demonstrate that in trials by judge alone, the court of appeal often can and should identify the defects in the analysis that led the trier of fact to an unreasonable conclusion.&nbsp; The court of appeal will therefore be justified to intervene and set aside a verdict as unreasonable when the reasons of the trial judge reveal that he or she was not alive to an applicable legal principle, or entered a verdict inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached.&nbsp; These discernable defects are themselves sometimes akin to a separate error of law, and therefore easily sustain the conclusion that the unreasonable verdict which rests upon them also raises a question of law.</p>

But this does not dispense the reviewing court from the need to articulate the basis upon which it finds that the conclusion reached by the jury was unreasonable. It is insufficient for the court of appeal to refer to a vague unease, or a lingering or lurking doubt based on its own review of the evidence.&nbsp; This ‚Äúlurking doubt‚Äù may be a powerful trigger for thorough<b> </b>appellate scrutiny of the evidence, but it is not, without further articulation of the basis for such doubt, a proper basis upon which to interfere with the findings of a jury.&nbsp; In other words, if, after reviewing the evidence at the end of an error-free trial which led to a conviction, the appeal court judge is left with a lurking doubt or feeling of unease, that doubt, which is not in itself sufficient to justify interfering with the conviction, may be a useful signal that the verdict was indeed reached in a non-judicial manner.

But these rules of caution cannot be exhaustive, they cannot capture every situation, and cannot be formulated in every case as a requirement of the charge.&nbsp; Rather, after the jury has been adequately charged as to the applicable law, and warned, if necessary, about drawing possibly unwarranted conclusions, it remains that in some cases, the totality of the evidence and the peculiar factual circumstances of a given case will lead an experienced jurist to conclude that the fact-finding exercise applied at trial was flawed&nbsp; in light of the unreasonable result that it produced.</p>

In that context, acting judicially means not only acting dispassionately, applying the law and adjudicating on the basis of the record and nothing else.&nbsp; It means, in addition, arriving at a conclusion that does not conflict with the bulk of judicial experience.&nbsp; This, in my view, is the assessment that must be made by the reviewing court. It requires not merely asking whether twelve properly instructed jurors, acting judicially, could reasonably have come to the same result, but doing so through the lens of judicial experience which serves as an additional protection against an unwarranted conviction.</p>

Keeper</i> (1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 156 (C.A.); <i>R. v.&nbsp; Malcolm</i> (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 196 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Tat</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. N.D.</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 2139 (QL) (C.A.).&nbsp; Judicial experience has also been relied upon to question the reasonableness of verdicts in cases of sexual misconduct presenting troubling features such as allegations of sexual touching of a bizarre nature (see, e.g., <i>Burke</i>, <i>supra</i>;<i> R. v. C.V.</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 1512 (QL) (C.A.); <i>R. v. L. (J.H.H.P.)</i> (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 165 (Man. C.A.)), or the possibility of collusion between witnesses (see, e.g., <i>Burke</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; Finally, the experience of the courts has occasionally been brought to bear, although not always explicitly, on the assessment of verdicts rejecting a&nbsp; defence with respect to which there may be unjustified skepticism or even prejudice because those relying on such justifications or excuses may be viewed as simply trying to avoid responsibility for their actions.<b>&nbsp; </b>See, e.g., <i>R. v. Vaillancourt</i> (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 530 (Que. C.A.); <i>Molodowic</i>, <i>supra</i>.<i> </i>&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">At the outset, the jury had, in the Crown opening, been advised of the theory that the fatal injuries were caused by actions of the [accused] Biniaris.&nbsp; By the end of the case there had been a complete reversal of this theory.&nbsp; He was now said to be liable to be found culpable of murder on the ground of being a party to the activity of Stark.&nbsp; It must be observed that the activity of Stark causative of the injuries had terminated almost entirely by the time Biniaris became involved in the affray.&nbsp; Blows struck by Stark after Niven was on the pavement were to his abdomen area and if, as was less than clear from the evidence, Stark did, near the termination of the incident, direct a kick at the chin of Niven, that again seems unlikely to have had any causal relationship to the serious brain injury.&nbsp; Thus in this case, we have the situation that anything done by Biniaris, the [accused], by his stomping activity, while no doubt manifesting an intention to assist Stark in his general assault of Niven, seems most unlikely to have been causative of the fatal brain injuries suffered by Niven.&nbsp; The nature of the brain injuries testified to by the experts makes the temporal sequence of events important here.&nbsp; This [accused] came into the fray at a point in time when, as I interpret the medical testimony, the damage to the brain of the deceased was irreversible.&nbsp;</p>

12.2pt">If one analyzes the activities of the two assailants, it seems to me to be an inescapable conclusion that the assaultive activity attributed to the [accused] all occurred after the infliction of the fatal harm and in circumstances where Biniaris‚Äô intention to assist in a murder is unclear.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In order to be found guilty of murder as a party, the jury would have to conclude that the [accused] had the same intent as the killer [i.e., the intent to cause death or the intention to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death, being reckless whether death ensued or not] and was carrying out these acts of stomping for the purpose of aiding and abetting in the murder of the deceased.&nbsp; The intention is probably less easy to attribute in the case of a sudden affray of this sort than might be the case where a deadly weapon is anticipated to be used.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I see the position of the [accused] in this case as rather different from that of Stark.&nbsp; Stark, the initial aggressor outside the store, decided to attack Niven and carried out that attack with great violence and with disastrous results.&nbsp; Biniaris was by no means the prime mover in the event.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Whether Stark was the initial aggressor, the degree and the intensity of the respondent‚Äôs participation in the attack and his intention or foresight at the time of his participation in the attack were all matters raised by the evidence and commented upon by the parties and by the trial judge.&nbsp; Although a conviction for manslaughter was a given, as was conceded by the respondent before this Court, and although reasonable people may disagree about whether they would have found, on the evidence, that the respondent had the requisite intent for murder, there is nothing to qualify that conclusion, which is really the only one in issue in this case, as an unreasonable one.</p>

It was clearly reasonable for the jury to conclude that the respondent had, through words and actions which encouraged and assisted Stark, participated in an interrelated chain of events which ultimately led to Niven‚Äôs death.&nbsp; The respondent does not dispute the reasonableness of this conclusion as is reflected in his submission that he was properly convicted of manslaughter.</p>
