The original applicant for restoration, Ernest Gombosh, was searched on two occasions in October, 1979. Several quantities of drugs, drug paraphenalia and cash were seized in the course of those searches and Mr. Gombosh was subsequently charged with offences under the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>. Mr. Gombosh applied, in December 1979, for restoration of the monies seized. The hearing was adjourned and Mr. Gombosh died before being prosecuted and before the restoration hearing process was completed. Letters of administration were granted to the current applicantââa person innocent of any wrongâdoingââwho pursued the restoration of the seized monies in his capacity as administrator. A judge of the Provincial Court ordered restoration but this order was quashed in the Supreme Court of Ontario and the matter remitted to Provincial Court. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the decision to quash.</span></p>

The three crucial questions to this appeal, then, were: what was meant by s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement, on whom was the burden of proof or disproof, and what was the standard of proof? </span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to satisfy a magistrate at a restoration hearing on the question of entitlement to possession, a claimant must show on the balance of probabilities that he was in possession of the property at the time of seizure. To place the onus on the claimant in this way does not offend established rules of procedure as the claim of entitlement at this stage is simply the assertion of a civil right. In addition, such evidence is readily obtainable by most claimants. The generous standing in s. 10(5) leaves it open to "any" other person to rebut the claim to possession.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While entitlement within the meaning of s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) can reasonably be assumed to mean "lawful entitlement", the rule of public policy that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrong doing should only operate where there is turpitude. Where that turpitude is a criminal wrong, criminality must be demonstrated in accordance with normal procedures. Section 10(8), which directs forfeiture of things seized which were "used in any manner" in connection with a narcotics offence of which a person has been convicted, codifies the <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</i> rule in the context of narcotics convictions.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tainted connection leading to forfeiture under s. 10(8) must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence as well as the nature of the proceedings under s. 10 make it inappropriate to transform a restoration hearing into a trial in which the Crown need only meet the civil standard of proof in order to establish guilt or taint. The culpability of the owner of the seized property must have been proven at antecedent criminal proceedings under the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>. In the absence of a specific finding at trial of the requisite "tainted connection", the Crown can prove taint on the reasonable doubt standard at the restoration hearing. Where there was no antecedent conviction and no basis for laying a narcotics related charge, proceedings should be initiated under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec312subsec1" target="_blank">s. 312(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although s. 10(8) might imply that the <i>ex turpi</i> rule is excluded by the <i>expressio unius est</i> <i>exclusio alterius</i> rule from operation under s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>), where the things are connected to a conviction for a nonânarcotics offence, such an interpretation would multiply proceedings and offend public perception of the justice system. The <i>expressio unius</i> rule, therefore, should not prevent a reading of s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement to mean "lawful entitlement" in this very limited context. </span></p>

Nâ1. Section 10 allows an officer to seize things which he or she suspects are related to the commission of a narcotics offence. However, the seizure provisions are not directly at issue in this appeal. Rather, the focus of the case is on the procedure called a restoration hearing by means of which a person can regain possession of the things seized. Section 10(6) sets out a twoâpart test governing restoration. The first part requires the magistrate to be satisfied that the applicant is "entitled to possession of the thing seized". The second part requires him to be satisfied that the thing seized is not required as evidence. It is the first part of the test and the nature of the burden it imposes which must be resolved in order to settle the present appeal. The meaning of the phrase "entitled to possession" must be ascertained in the context of the peculiar facts of this case, namely that the appellant is the innocent representative of the allegedly nonâinnocent person from whom the things were seized. The original claimant died before being prosecuted and before the restoration hearing process was completed.</span></p>

Several quantities of drugs, drug paraphenalia and cash were seized in the course of those searches and Mr. Gombosh was subsequently charged with offences under the <i>Narcotic Control Act.</i> On December 17, 1979 Mr. Gombosh applied for restoration of the monies seized. The hearing was adjourned. However, on February 28, 1980 Mr. Gombosh died before being prosecuted and before the restoration hearing process was completed. Letters of administration were granted to the current appellant, Eric Fleming. He pursued restoration of the seized monies in his capacity as administrator of Mr. Gombosh's estate.</span></p>

That section allows an officer without a warrant to enter and search certain premises and seize things found therein which he reasonably believes are related to a narcotics offence <u>or</u> may be evidence of such an offence. Restoration under s. 10(6) is contingent on the presiding magistrate's being satisfied that the appellant is "entitled to possession" of the thing seized <u>and</u> that it is not required as evidence. Conversely, where as in the present case there is no evidentiary use for the property and no conviction has been entered, the Minister's custody under s. 10(7) of "things seized" is legitimate only where entitlement has not been demonstrated to the presiding magistrate's satisfaction. Thus, the crucial questions to be answered are what is meant by entitlement, who has the burden of its proof or disproof, and what is the standard of proof? Finally, it should be noted that "disentitlement" or forfeiture is mandated where the narrow conditions of s. 10(8) are met, <i>i.e</i>. where seized monies were used for the purchase of a narcotic in respect of which a person has been convicted of a narcotics offence.</span></p>

Waisberg J. of the Ontario Provincial Court presided at the restoration hearing. He felt that entitlement should be narrowly construed since the consequence of failing to meet the test was to deprive an applicant of "several rights". Because of the original applicant's death there was no possible evidentiary use for the seized monies in this case. Judge Waisberg observed that if the matter had gone to trial there might well have been a conviction. Nevertheless, he felt satisfied that the current appellant was entitled to possession as administrator of the original applicant's estate. In his view, the suspected connection of the monies to drug trafficking did not defeat restoration. He made the requested order.</span></p>

(3d) 323] quashed the Provincial Court Judge's order on the basis of <i>Largie v. R.</i> (1982), 25 C.R. (3d) 289, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal which had been handed down in the interim. In his view, Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. had failed to take account of the rule of public policy that the courts will not permit a litigant to benefit from his or her crime. He rejected the appellant's argument that "when a claimant accused has died, the purpose behind the rule loses its legitimacy assuming the absence of any evidence that the representative is tainted", and thus "restoration should be made virtually for the asking". Such a result, to Smith J.'s mind, ignored the scheme of the legislation as defined in <i>Re Aimonetti and The Queen</i> (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 164, a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal which was heavily relied on in <i>Largie</i>, <i>supra</i>. The Ontario Supreme Court in <i>Largie</i> had quashed the trial judge's restoration order on the basis of the rule of public policy. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld that decision without, however, giving express approval to the reasoning on which it was based. Instead, Houlden J.A. adopted the approach of the majority in <i>Aimonetti</i> which, by reading s. 10 in its totality, found that the Minister's right to custody under s. 10(7) is directly proportionate to the scope of the seizure power in s. 10(1)(<i>c</i>). Thus, in order to obtain restoration an applicant must disprove the suspected relationship between the things seized and narcotics offences. Smith J. in the case at hand combined the public policy <i>rationale</i> with the textual analysis of <i>Aimonetti</i> in the following passage at p. 327: </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the matter might be put differently. When applying the public policy rule in the context of the seizure provisions of the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>, the courts have tended to apply the taint to the "thing" or the monies rather than to the applicant. And that view is supported by the wording of the section.</span></p>

However, the core of Smith J.'s reasoning is that once one replaces the personâspecific approach of an analyÂ­sis based on the rule of public policy with the thingâspecific approach of an analysis based on the statutory text, the innocence of the person applying for restoration becomes irrelevant.</span></p>

(3d) 575] upheld Smith J.'s decision to quash in very short reasons written by LacourciÃ¨re J.A. However, LacourciÃ¨re J.A.'s analysis appears to be a reversion to the public policy <i>rationale</i> so carefully avoided by the Court of Appeal in <i>Largie</i>. He founds his decision on the view [at pp. 575â76] that "the appellant as administrator of the deceased's estate can be in no better position to claim the restoration of the funds, the apparent proceeds of the alleged crime, than the alleged deceased perpetrator". Implicit in that position is the belief that the personâspecific public policy rule applies and that the entire case therefore turns on the peculiar fact that the applicant is an innocent representative of the allegedly nonÂ­innocent original applicant.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This divergence in analytic approach in the decisions below reflects a divergence in jurisprudential treatment of s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) generally. B. R. Shilton in his article "Drug MoneysââThe Fruits of Crime?" 25 C.R. (2d) 294, has identified three conceptually distinct judicial interpretations of s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement. The parties to this appeal admit of two possible approaches in their written argument. An examination of the restoration hearing transcript reveals that a third restrictive interpretation was proposed by the appellant at first instance and, indeed, was accepted by Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. as being the most appropriate approach. For convenience I will label the three interpretive approaches as follows: (1) the simple proof of entitlement approach; (2) the public policy approach; and (3) the legislative text approach. The unusual fact of the original applicant's death throws into sharp relief the conceptual distinction between the latter two approaches. Generally, an applicant is the person from whom the things in question were originally seized. From that perspective, the effect of the public policy approach and the legislative text approach is the same, <i>i.e</i>., an applicant must disprove "taint" in order to show entitlement. However, standing under the Act is quite broad; it allows "any person" to apply for restoration. If that person has no connection to the reasonable suspicion which prompted the seizure in the first place, the difference between the two approaches, as LacourciÃ¨re J.A.'s decision demonstrates, becomes very important. If the taint attaches to the person, then the appellant's innocent representative status may be significant. But, if the taint attaches to the thing seized, as Smith J. concluded, then the innocent status of the applicant may be irrelevant. It must be remembered, however, that this dichotomy arises only if one rejects the first approach which simply requires an applicant to prove entitlement. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was suggested by counsel for the respondent that the appellant made a concession in the course of the restoration hearing which concludes the case against him and obviates the need to discuss the distinctions between the various approaches. I would respectfully disagree. At the hearing the appellant's counsel argued that, since forfeiture could only occur under the conditions set out in s. 10(8), the first approach, namely simple proof of entitlement, was all that was required of an applicant in order to succeed on his application. He went on to concede that, if he was wrong in that and had to prove in addition the absence of taint, he would be unable to discharge that burden. Accordingly, if the Court were to find that the rule of public policy operated <i>visâÃ âvis</i> innocent representatives of less worthy litigants, this concession would be fatal to the appellant's case under both the public policy and the legislative text approaches. The concession would be irrelevant, however, if the Court were to find, as did Waisberg Prov. Ct. J., that all s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) requires is proof of the right to possession. Thus, at the very least the Court must discuss the merits of the first analytic approach. Then, if that analysis is rejected, it must go on to discuss the viability of the argument that a claim by an innocent representative should not be defeated by the taint associated with the original claimant. If the result is again negative, only then does the appellant's concession disqualify him from success. However, it would be difficult to discuss fully the merits of any of the possible approaches to s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement without reviewing the divergent lines of jurisprudence. I propose therefore not to limit my analysis of the section in the way suggested by respondent's counsel.</span></p>

J., after finding that the terms of s. 10(8) could not be met even after conviction, concluded that the main issue was the evidentiary use of the seized monies. He thereby assumed that the Minister could not retain the monies under s. 10(7) on any other basis. This diminished reading of the purpose of the Minister's custody is confirmed by Rice Prov. Ct. J.'s treatment of s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) in the hearing at first instance in <i>Largie</i>, <i>supra</i>. There he held, according to Houlden J.A., that entitlement in s. l0(6)(<i>a</i>) "was used in the legal sense, not in the moral sense and that if the appellant could show that he was entitled to possession of the money as opposed to any other person, he was entitled to an order of restoration": see <i>Largie</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 291. </span></p>

The accused had pleaded guilty to an offence under the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>. There was no indication in the evidence that the monies were related to that offence. Addy J., like Rice Prov. Ct. J., was of the view that, where there was no evidentiary use for the property and no forfeiture under s. 10(8), entitlement was simply a question of who was the most likely owner or had the right to possession. Property rights were not subject to the applicant's disproof of taint. Quite the contrary; the Minister's s. 10(7) possessory right was subject to the proprietary rights of interested persons. He stated at pp. 199â200:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">It is obvious that section 10(8), in addition to providing that the Minister may direct the disposition of money seized, specifically stipulates that any money seized which was <u>used for the purchase of a narcotic</u> is forfeited to Her Majesty. This is the only case where any provision is made as to forfeiture of monies and it is clear from the admitted facts, in the case at bar, that the monies in question were not so used. Altogether apart from the principle that if a statute purporting to forfeit a property right must specifically state so, in view of the specific provisions as to forfeiture in subsection (8), I must conclude that subsection (7) does not in any way provide for the forfeiture of any property right or any right to possession since no forfeiture is mentioned in that subsection. Thus, the discretion of the Minister in that particular subsection is subject to any property rights of persons interested in the "thing" seized.</span></p>

From this standpoint the scope of entitlement in s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) is bounded on the one hand by the presumption of innocence and on the other hand by the presumption of constitutionality. The presumption of innocence addresses the impropriety in terms of fundamental principles of criminal law of the imposition of a penalty of forfeiture where there has been no proof that an offence associated with the goods has been committed. The presumption of constitutionality addresses the impropriety in terms of legislative competence of federal legislative interference with property rights apart from any valid federal objective.</span></p>

(2d) 91, takes this same narrow interpretive approach. The case deals with s. 10(9) which is exclusively concerned with forfeiture of seized conveyances. Subsection 10(6) is subject to ss. 10(8) and 10(9). At the restoration hearing the Crown argued that "subject to" meant that s. 10(9) should prevail until it was established that its terms could not be met. The applicant argued that this restricted s. 10(6) to a very limited operation as the class of things liable to seizure under s. 10(1)(<i>c</i>) but not liable to forfeiture under ss. 10(8) and 10(9) is almost nonâexistent. The majority at the Court of Appeal quashed the order denying restoration at first instance. Although the applicant had not disproved taint, it was felt that the requirements of ss. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) had nevertheless been met. Hall J.A., with whom three others concurred, found that an order granting restoration is not necessarily inconsistent with a later order of forfeiture. In the course of his reasons he stated at p. 95:</span></p>

Deprivation of property as provided in the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i> is, to say the least, an extraordinary measure; that is not to say it is bad but rather the remedy of restoration and the ultimate penalty of forfeiture need to be reviewed in the context of the Act providing for them. Clear terms are required before depriving a person of his property, either temporarily or permanently.</span></p>

However, such deprivation is not unusual under criminal statutes although, as Addy J. has pointed out, an attempt by Parliament to expropriate property for a purpose which is outside federal competence would likely be <i>ultra vires</i>. Alternatively, the rule can be described in terms of a presumption favouring strict construction of penal statutes. Indeed, this seems to be the context in which Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. invoked a restrictive interpretive approach in the present case. Although he explained that he was doing so because forfeiture deprives the accused of "several rights", he also pointed out that the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i> is a statute "involving criminal prosecution", that all criminal matters with regard to the original applicant came to an end with his death, and that there has never been a final adjudication of guilt or innocence. </span></p>

This Court in <i>R. v. Robinson</i>, [1951] S.C.R. 522, determined that no such general rule exists in Canadian criminal law. Admittedly subsequent cases have modified that position. However, the impropriety of requiring an applicant to disprove taint in a s. 10 restoration hearing does not stem simply from an assertion, dubious since <i>Robinson</i>, that it is improper to give a large and remedial reading to criminal provisions. Rather, the impropriety relates to the use of that broad interpretive approach to undermine the presumption of innocence which traditionally places the burden of proof on the Crown. Although it is clear from the case law under the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> that it is open to Parliament to enact exceptions to the presumption of innocence, s. 2 of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, if nothing else, expressly requires that any such exceptions be strictly construed. That section reads in part:</span></p>

(3d) 377, comes closest to articulating fully the inconsistency between an enlarged definition of entitlement and fundamental principles of criminal law.

Montgomery J.A.'s reasons at p. 378 are brief and to the point:</span></p>

This is contrary to the principle of <i>autrefois acquit</i>, and I cannot agree that it was Parliament's intention that s. 10 of the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. Nâ1, should bear such a meaning.</span></p>

McCarthy J.A., with whom Jacques J.A. concurred, acknowledges that s. 10 places the burden of disproof of taint on an applicant but finds that it is an error of law not to consider the applicant's acquittal when applying the test of entitlement. He states at pp. 380â81:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">In fact, it is only because the police believed that an offence under the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i> had been committed that they were able to carry out the seizure (s. 10(1)(<i>c</i>)). The innocence of the accused with respect to the offence for which he is charged is settled once and for all (except for appeal, which is not the present case) by his acquittal. I do not believe that Parliament wished that the accused be obliged to convince the judge of his innocence, whether the same judge or another judge, a second time, or to convince him of his innocence with respect to offences with which he has not even been charged, in order to regain possession of a thing which had been seized.</span></p>

That issue is central to the resolution of the present appeal. </span></p>

Molina</i> (1985), 7 O.A.C. 235, the Ontario Court of Appeal refrained from clarifying and reinforcing its decision in <i>Largie</i>, <i>supra</i>, and from making a clear pronouncement with regard to onus of proof of "taint" in s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>). Vanek Prov.Ct.J. had restored seized monies to an applicant in spite of finding that the applicant was "reluctant, unwilling or unable to provide a satisfactory explanation of the source from which all this money was generated, and how it came to be accumulated". Neither <i>Aimonetti</i>, <i>supra</i>, nor <i>Largie</i>, <i>supra</i>, nor the provisions of the <i>Narcotic Control Act</i> in Vanek J.'s view justified the conclusion that there is an onus on an applicant to prove that seized monies were not derived from traffic in drugs. As the Crown had failed to adduce any evidence on which he could reasonably conclude that the monies were tainted, he restored them. The Court of Appeal quashed the trial judge's restoration order. Grange J.A., in oral reasons for the Court, based his decision on a finding that Vanek J.'s assessment of the evidence was in error and that the Crown had provided enough evidence on which one could reasonably conclude that the applicant acquired the seized monies from drug trafficking. In doing so Grange J.A. not only sidesteps the question of onus but also gives a very cautious reading to <i>Largie</i> and <i>Aimonetti</i> as follows at p. 238:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirement that an applicant disprove taint because of "the well known rule of public policy" is found by reading "entitled" in s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) as meaning "lawfully entitled". This triggers the application of the maxim <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</i>. Failure to consider this rule of public policy constitutes the requisite "error of law" on the basis of which a superior court reviewing on <i>certiorari</i> can quash a magistrate's decision. In order to prove lawful entitlement an applicant is usually called upon to demonstrate that the monies came from a legitimate source and are therefore not the profits of crime. It is generally accepted that the rule is personâspecific, <i>i.e</i>., that what is abhorrent to public perception is the spectacle of the actual wrongdoer reaping the benefits of his or her wrongdoing with the compliance, if not the assistance, of the courts. From this standpoint the appellant's assertion that his status as an innocent representative undermines the purpose of the rule is crucial to his success in the current appeal. The cases can be divided into two categories: (1) those in which the turpitude which triggers the rule consists of a reasonable belief on the part of the authorities that the monies seized are related to a narcotics offence, and (2) those in which the suspected taint has been confirmed by the applicant's own admissions.</span></p>

Putting the Crown's case in its strongest possible positionââthat the amount derived from narcotic sale is to be considered as $1,099 and the amount derived from the sale of the car at $1 still results in the sum of $1 being forfeited to the Crown completely without any authority to do so. Further to require the applicant to prove the proportions of the source of the money when the admitted facts are that the "mixed fund" is in "indeterminate proportions" places an impossible burden upon him which again would result in an effective forfeiture without authority in that the money would be held in perpetuity by the Minister ... .</span></p>

I find that the applicant has proved on a preponderance of evidence that he is entitled to possession of the $1,100 concerned, and since subpara.

Mr. Medd swore that the money was not the fruits of illegal trade in narcotics but of another illegal activity. He asks for the money back. The court should not entertain that approach. In rejecting it, the court is not deciding the issue of ownership, which could be the subject of separate civil proceedings if Mr. Medd be so advised. </span></p>

However it replaces the narrow focus of the public policy <i>rationale</i> on the word "entitlement" in s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) with a careful reading of the entire statutory scheme in s. 10. There are two consequences of this difference in approach which are significant for the purposes of the current appeal. First, as mentioned earlier, the taint attaches to the thing seized rather than to the person applying. Thus the innocence of the present appellant has no impact on result under this analysis. Secondly, the turpitude which is traditionally required to trigger the <i>ex turpi</i> rule has been legislatively replaced by the reasonable belief of the officer who seized the goods initially that those goods are associated with narcotics offences.</span></p>

(2d) 529 (Man.), is one of the earliest expressions of this approach. Although the application failed for nonâcompliance with the technical requirements in s. 10(5), the trial judge nevertheless considered the merits of the claim and in particular the scope of s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement. He placed great importance on the use of the word "satisfied" in that section in terms of the Magistrate's being satisfied that the applicant was entitled to possession of the goods. In his view the word meant different things in different contexts. Therefore he focused on the context of s. 10 in its totality. He wrote at p. 535:</span></p>

(8). Any other money seized may be restored pursuant to an application under sâs. (5). If it had been Parliament's intention, however, that such money was to be restored merely upon the failure of the Crown to show that it was used for the purchase of the narcotic which is the subject of the proceedings, it might simply have enabled or required the Court to restore such money by reason of that failure to the person, if any, from whom it was seized. Parliament, however, has made it necessary that an application be made to a Magistrate and that the Magistrate be satisfied of the applicant's entitlement to possession.</span></p>

In the circumstances of such a seizure it appears likely that it was the legislative intent to require a person who seeks restoration to provide proof of his right to possession. Evidence relating to the legitimate source of the applicant's acquisition of the moneys, in a case such as the present case, might well be a relevant consideration. </span></p>

In other words the fact of a s. 10 seizure is evidence of taint, and strictly speaking, the Crown need not lead any further evidence. If the applicant fails to demonstrate the legitimacy of the funds' source, the fact of seizure becomes conclusive evidence of taint. In <i>Tupper</i> the Crown actually did call a witness who gave additional circumstantial evidence of the monies' taint, namely that they were found in a vase along with two scraps of paper on which figures followed by the abbreviations "lbs." and "oz." were written.</span></p>

Again, the Crown in that case led additional evidence of taint, namely that traces of cannabis resin were found on some of the seized bills. Huband J.A.'s majority reasons are very similar to the reasons in <i>Tupper.</i> The following passage, which was approved by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Largie</i>, sets out the critical elements of the third analytic approach at pp. 171â72:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at s. 10 in its totality, I think it is clear that the authorities are entitled to seize cash, beyond that which may be involved in a particular illicit transaction with respect to which a charge is laid. Money actually used in the purchase of a narcotic is to be forfeited to Her Majesty at the conclusion of a trial, under sâs. (8). The money we are now concerned with falls in a different category. The scheme of the Act, as I see it, allows police authority to seize property related to the illicit trade in drugs, possession of which is then turned over to the Minister unless the applicant is able to make out a case for restoration. The procedures under s. 10 do not constitute the Minister or the Crown as owner of the property in question. The Minister becomes entitled to "possession", but it is then open to the accused, or indeed anyone else, to advance a civil claim for the recovery of the property from the Minister. In <i>Smith v. The Queen</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 252, 67 D.L.R. (3d) 177, [1976] 1 F.C. 196, Addy J. of the Federal Court made it clear that s. 10(5) and (7) are "merely procedural and custodial", and that "they do not either explicitly or by necessary implication" cause any property right to be forfeited. The right to advance a proprietary claim in separate civil proceedings is open to anyone.</span></p>

The scheme of the Act is to deny possession of such funds to one accused and subsequently convicted of participating in illegal trade, (subject to that person's right to claim ownership in separate civil proceedings). It would be contrary to the scheme of the Act to allow restoration on the limited ground that the money could not be identified in a transaction with the specific narcotic found on the premises. In my opinion, Kopstein Prov. J. had the jurisdiction to deny the application for restoration in spite of the fact that the money in question was not directly identified as flowing from a transaction involving the <i>cannabis</i> resin seized from the premises. So long as there was evidence upon which he could reasonably conclude that the money resulted from illegal trade in narcotics, he was entitled to treat such money as a thing "in respect of which ... an offence ... has been committed", to borrow from the language employed in s. 10(1)(<i>c</i>). </span></p>

Houlden J.A. in that case stated that restoration should not be granted if the seized money was obtained from the sale of narcotics thus encouraging the commission of a s. 312(1) offence. This glosses over the fact that the elements of a s. 312(1) offence had not been proven. Indeed, in <i>Largie</i> it appears that the "taint" stemmed from the simple fact that the money was seized in the course of a s. 10 search.

If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

As Viscount Sankey's pronouncement makes clear, two fundamental tenets flow from the presumption of innocence: first, that the burden of proof is upon the Crown and second, that proof is on the high standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, Viscount Sankey acknowledged the legitimacy of statutory incursion into the principle and the jurisprudence of this Court under the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> acknowledges to some degree the validity of such legislative derogation. However, Ritchie J.'s majority decision in the leading case of <i>R. v. Appleby</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 303, maintained that an enactment which reverses the onus of proof must do so expressly. Indeed, the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> itself, as discussed earlier, if nothing else requires express words in order "to abrogate, abridge or infringe" any of the rights and freedoms in s. 2. Accordingly, if legislation permanently dispossessing a person of his or her property is properly characterized as penal, and in this case I think it is, then the procedural protections enshrined in the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> which attend the imposition of penalties by the state should apply.</span></p>

-.15pt">While this would perhaps be reasonable if the elements of a s. 312(1) offence had been proven, it seems unorthodox to deny restoration on the possibility that this would lead to the commission of such an offence. Section 312(1) stipulates that not only must an accused be in possession of tainted property but he or she must also have knowledge of the taint. In <i>Largie</i> the applicant led evidence at his hearing to show that the seized monies were derived from painting and decorating. Rice Prov. Ct. J. took the position that entitlement could be established without evidence of the source of the cash. No other evidence of taint or of knowledge of taint is mentioned by Houlden J.A. apart from the initial seizure. While a law which is specifically aimed at the prevention of crime was upheld in <i>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. v. The Queen</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 303, its operation was contingent on the previous commission of an offence. The provision in question allowed the court under s. 31 of the <i>Combines Investigation Act</i>, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26 as reâenacted by 1952 (Can.), c. 39, s. 3, to order, in addition to any other penalty, the prohibition of the continuation or repetition of the offence of which the person had been convicted. In the present case not only is there no conviction, but there is no express legislative grant of authority to the magistrate. Furthermore, the judicial exercise of such a preventive power in these circumstances undermines established rules of proof and procedure designed to protect the accused. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this case to decide whether in fact an explicit legislative attempt would fall within federal competence over crime prevention. </span></p>

Again this seems to be an unwarranted exercise of judicial power in the form of preventive regulation of criminal behaviour contrary to both the normal operation of the <i>ex turpi</i> rule as well as fundamental principles of our justice system. In the circumstances it would be more consistent with considerations of public policy to grant rather than to deny restoration.</span></p>

In the previously quoted passage from <i>Aimonetti</i>, at pp. 171â72, Huband J.A. makes reference to Addy J.'s characterization in <i>Smith</i> of ss. 10(5) and 10(6) as "merely procedural and custodial" and as neither explicitly nor implicitly causing forfeiture. Rather, a denial of restoration was described by Huband J.A. as simply a denial of possession and he was at pains to point out that it remained open to an applicant "to advance a proprietary claim" in a separate civil action against the Minister. Indeed, this was the nature of the action in <i>Smith.</i></span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Huband J.A.'s view of the restoration hearing process was rejected by Mahoney J. of the Federal Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Aimonetti</i> (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 481. When the applicant in <i>Aimonetti</i> met with failure in the Manitoba Court of Appeal and his application for leave to appeal that decision to this Court was dismissed, he instituted a civil action in the trial division of the Federal Court for the return to him as legal owner of the seized money plus interest. A preliminary question concerning the Federal Court's jurisdiction and <i>res judicata</i> was put to the Court of Appeal. Mahoney J. held that the cause of action at the restoration hearing was the same as the cause of action before the Federal Court. The applicant's ownership of the property had never been in question as no s. 10(8) forfeiture had ever taken place. Thus, the issue of possession had been conclusively determined under ss. 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) in favour of the Minister. There was no need to distinguish <i>Smith</i> as in that case no previous restoration hearing had taken place. If Mahoney J. is correct, then what might otherwise be described as administrative detention of property subject to an ultimate determination of legal title is in fact a final and judicial determination of possessory rights. A denial of restoration is tantamount to a penalty of permanent dispossession.</span></p>

Furthermore, the notion that there should be an exact correlation between the scope of the seizure power in s. 10(1)(<i>c</i>) and ministerial custody in s. 10(7), while formally pleasing in its symmetry, does not make functional sense. The considerations which would favour a fairly broad grant of power to a police officer under a search warrant to the detriment of the right of an individual to preserve his or her privacy no longer operate at the point of a restoration hearing. A further detention of property which has no evidentiary use and which has not been shown to be associated with the commission of an offence serves no legitimate purpose and would seem to require much clearer language than that employed in s. 10. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of these reasons I stated that three crucial questions must be answered in order to settle this appeal: what is meant by s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement, on whom lies the burden of its proof or disproof, and what is the standard of proof? In light of the foregoing discussion I would conclude that, generally speaking, the restrictive interpretation which I have called the simple proof of entitlement approach is completely consistent with the general principles of criminal justice and with the actual scheme in s. 10. Many of the decisions which employ this approach, including that of Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. in the present case, rely either explicitly or implicitly on the presumption of legal title to the goods which arises from the fact of possession. The rule is summarized in <i>Halsburyâs Laws of England</i>, vol. 35, 4th ed., at paragraph 1122 as follows:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> The presumption of law is that the person who has de facto possession also has the property, and accordingly such possession is protected, whatever its origin, against all who cannot prove a superior title. This rule applies equally in criminal and civil matters. Thus, as against a stranger or a wrongdoer, a person in actual or apparent possession, but without the right to possession, has all the rights and remedies of a person entitled to and able to prove a present right to possession.</span></p>

Bagshaw</i>, [1972]) S.C.R. 2. Thus, in order to satisfy a magistrate at a restoration hearing on the question of entitlement, a claimant should be prepared to show on the balance of probabilities that he or she was in possession of the property at the time of seizure. To place the onus on the claimant in this way does not offend established rules of procedure as the claim of entitlement at this stage is simply the assertion of a civil right. In addition, such evidence is readily obtainable by most claimants. The generous standing in s. 10(5) leaves it open to "any" other person to rebut the claim to possession.</span></p>

Where that turpitude is a criminal wrong, criminality must be demonstrated in accordance with normal procedures. Section 10(8) which directs forfeiture of things seized which were "used in any manner" in connection with a narcotics offence of which a person has been convicted, codifies the <i>ex turpi</i> rule in the context of narcotics convictions. This leaves open two questions. How must the tainted connection be proven under s. 10(8), and does that section imply that the <i>ex turpi</i> rule is excluded from operation under s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) where the things seized are connected to a conviction for a nonânarcotics offence?</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer to the first question is subject to the same considerations that apply to the discussion of the burden imposed on an applicant by s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement. Fundamental principles of criminal justice as well as the nature of the proceedings under s. 10 make it inappropriate to transform a restoration hearing into a trial in which the Crown need only meet the civil standard of proof in order to establish guilt or "taint". Thus the culpability of the owner of the seized property must have been proven at antecedent criminal proceedings under the <i>Narcotic Control Act.</i> In the absence of a specific finding at trial of the requisite "tainted connection", the Crown may fill the evidentiary gap by proving taint on the reasonable doubt standard at the restoration hearing. Where there is no antecedent conviction and no basis for laying a narcotics related charge, proceedings should be initiated under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec312subsec1" target="_blank">s. 312(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.</i> </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question concerns the situation in which the Crown places in evidence a prior conviction for a nonânarcotics offence and the association of the seized property with the commission of that offence. The interpretive guideline <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> suggests that s. 10(8) precludes the operation of the <i>ex turpi</i> rule here. However, such an interpretation would multiply proceedings as well as offend public perception of the justice system. Accordingly, I do not think the <i>expressio unius</i> rule should prevent a reading of s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) entitlement to mean "lawful entitlement" in this very limited context. The more fundamental question remains whether the <i>ex turpi</i> rule has been correctly applied, namely whether the facts of a connection between the property and the commission of an offence, be it a <i>Code</i> offence or a narcotics offence, have been properly established. In summary, the public policy approach is to be faulted only in those cases in which this factual basis for its operation is lacking. In addition, where the rule of public policy legitimately applies, the status of an applicant as the innocent representative of a convicted but deceased owner would not entitle the applicant to restoration. In general, I agree with the following characterization of the <i>ex turpi</i> rule by Lord Diplock in <i>Hardy v. Motor Insurers' Bureau</i>, [1964] 2 All E.R. 742, at pp. 750â51, and with his assumption that a successor stands in the shoes of the original claimant:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the argument in this case centred on the appellant's status as an innocent representative of the estate in answer to the allegation of taint associated with the seized monies. There was no admission of guilt by the appellant, simply an admission that a burden of disproof of guilt could not be met. In the debate over the effect of the original applicant's death on the interpretive alternatives, little attention was paid to the preliminary question of whether in any circumstances a magistrate under s. 10 may deny restoration of things seized to their proper owner where no conviction has been entered and where the evidentiary use of the things has either expired or is nonâexistent. It seems to me, for the reasons given in the preceding discussion, that a negative answer must be given to that question. While the Crown may defeat entitlement by fulfilling the terms of s. 10(8) or alternatively, by placing in evidence the necessary facts to show that entitlement under s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) would be unlawful, in both those situations the fact of a previous conviction is a condition precedent. Thus the appellant's lack of association with the reasonably held belief which prompted the initial seizure is irrelevant. Indeed, even if it were clear on the evidence that the appellant was closely involved in Mr. Gombosh's affairs, this would not be determinative by itself. The Crown has not argued that the monies seized are related to any ongoing investigation of Mr. Gombosh, the appellant, or any other person. As Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. pointed out, all criminal proceedings against Mr. Gombosh were discontinued at his death. Thus, there is no evidentiary use for the monies and the s. 10(6)(<i>b</i>) branch of the test for restoration is satisfied. In addition, counsel for the Crown conceded at the restoration hearing that there was sufficient evidence to show that Mr. Gombosh was in physical possession of the seized monies. The presumption of entitlement which operates in that circumstance has not been rebutted. Nor has the appellant's status as the representative of Mr. Gombosh's estate been challenged. Accordingly, the s. 10(6)(<i>a</i>) branch of the test for restoration has also been satisfied.</span></p>
