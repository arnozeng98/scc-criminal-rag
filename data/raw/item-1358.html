 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Following this Court's decision in <i>Corbett</i>, some degree of confusion arose as to the appropriate standard of review where the "reasonableness" of a verdict was in question.&nbsp; One possible interpretation of <i>Corbett</i> was that the court of appeal could only intervene where it took the view that no jury acting judicially could have <u>possibly</u> reached the verdict rendered at trial.&nbsp; Clearly, this interpretation of the <i>Corbett</i> decision set the standard of review so high that it was virtually unattainable.&nbsp; Another view of the <i>Corbett</i> decision was that a court of appeal could intervene in any case where no jury acting judicially could <u>reasonably</u> have reached the verdict rendered at trial.&nbsp; The confusion concerning the standard of review was finally settled by the unanimous Court in <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168.&nbsp; In that case, McIntyre J. settled the issue as follows, at p. 185:</span></p>

Carter</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938.&nbsp; See also <i>R. v. Evans</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653.&nbsp; The more conventional approach adopted by Lords Griffiths and Mustill is that once the trial judge decides that the evidence is admissible, it is the trier of fact who determines what weight, if any, is to be given to the evidence having regard to all the circumstances, including the possibility of collusion.</span></p>
