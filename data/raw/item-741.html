   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; Credibility was a fundamental issue and the case fell to be decided on the basis of the evidence of the complainant versus that of the accused.&nbsp; The charge as a whole must be examined in determining whether or not an instruction is correct.</span></p>

Desveaux</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 88 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 93, where it was said:</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">Questions from a jury manifest their concern and indicate their desire for direction on a particular issue.&nbsp; The trial judge should read the question to counsel and obtain their submissions as to the response that should be made.&nbsp; It is then incumbent on the trial judge to answer the question in a complete and reasonably detailed manner.&nbsp; It is unfair to the parties and the jury to attempt a short form answer to a problem that is obviously presenting difficulties.&nbsp; The definitions requested had been adequately set out early in the charge.&nbsp; However, memories are short and much had intervened in the way of directions and recharges before the question was submitted.&nbsp; The original instructions should have been repeated in the response.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">If the error had occurred in the course of a response to a question from the jury or if the recharge had been given some hours after the main charge, a new trial would have to be ordered.&nbsp; However, in the case at bar, the jury had not yet begun its deliberations and the main charge, correctly and fairly given, had been completed just a few minutes earlier.&nbsp; The correct instructions as to the burden of proof must have been fresh in the minds of the jury at the time of the recharge.</span></p>
