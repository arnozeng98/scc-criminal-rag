M.A. testified that the accused accompanied a mutual friend to her apartment.&nbsp; After the friend left, the accused struck her across the forehead with a mug and choked her into unconsciousness.&nbsp; She was sexually assaulted with an object while unconscious.&nbsp; The accused applied to sever the counts in order to be tried separately in respect to each sexual assault.&nbsp; The trial judge denied the application.&nbsp; He found that there was a nexus in time and place but observed that he was “not persuaded that, at trial, the question of prejudice will be a significant factor at all” since “a modern jury should be able to handle the instructions given by [him] to avoid any meaningful possibility of prejudice”.&nbsp; He did not put much weight on a statement by defence counsel that the accused might wish to testify on counts related to one incident but not the other.&nbsp; He held that the case was not complex, and that the possibility of inconsistent verdicts did “not loom large”.&nbsp; This led him to conclude that the interests of justice did not require severance in this case.&nbsp; At trial, the accused was convicted on all charges and a majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions.</span></p>

At the end of the night, a friend of S.M. offered them a ride home from the night club. When they arrived at Mr. Last’s home, S.M. informed Mr. Last that she would not be accompanying him. Mr. Last refused to get out of the car unless S.M. got out with him. Not wanting to inconvenience her friend, whose parents had imposed a curfew, S.M. decided to get out of the car and call a taxi from Mr. Last’s home. S.M. testified that once she was inside his home, Mr. Last pulled out a gun and held it to her forehead. According to S.M., Mr. Last then proceeded to choke her and repeatedly sexually assault her orally, vaginally and anally. S.M. eventually escaped once Mr. Last fell asleep.</p>

This was the first time M.A. had met Mr. Last. After introductions and a brief conversation over a cup of tea, the friend got up to leave to go to a bar. Mr. Last refused to accompany her because he did not have enough money or proper identification to go to a bar. After a brief discussion, it was agreed that Mr. Last would stay behind with M.A. and wait for the friend’s return. At one point, once the friend had left, Mr. Last went to the kitchen to get more tea and came back with his mug and sat down. According to M.A., Mr. Last then stood up and struck her across the forehead with a tea mug. M.A. testified that he grabbed her throat with both hands and started choking her until she was unconscious. When M.A. eventually awoke, she had a seizure. Once she recovered from the seizure she realized she was naked and covered in blood. M.A. managed to wrap a towel around herself and exit her apartment, which had been locked from the outside. M.A. sought help from the superintendents of her apartment building, who immediately called the police. M.A. identified Mr. Last as her assaulter.</p>

He found that there was a nexus in time and place because “[t]he incidents giving rise to the charges only occurred roughly one month apart” in the same city. He then observed that he was “not persuaded that, at trial, the question of prejudice will be a significant factor at all” since “a modern jury should be able to handle the instructions given by [him] to avoid any meaningful possibility of prejudice” (A.R., at p. 79). He did not put much weight on the statement by defence counsel that the accused might wish to testify on counts related to one incident but not the other because he found “that point was taken so vaguely as not to constitute a significant factor” (A.R., at p. 80).&nbsp; He also noted that the case was not complex, and that the possibility of inconsistent verdicts did “not loom large”.

Under s.&nbsp;591(3)(<i>a</i>), however, a court may order that the accused be tried separately on one or more of the counts “where it is satisfied that the interests of justice so require”. As noted by this Court in <i>R. v. Litchfield</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333, the absence of specific guidelines for granting severance requires that deference be afforded to a trial judge’s ruling to the extent that he or she acts judicially and the ruling does not result in an injustice:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
200%">The criteria for when a count should be divided or a severance granted are contained in ss. 590(3) and 591(3) of the <i>Code</i>. These criteria are very broad: the court must be satisfied that the ends or interests of justice require the order in question. Therefore, in the absence of stricter guidelines, making an order for the division or severance of counts requires the exercise of a great deal of discretion on the part of the issuing judge. The decisions of provincial appellate courts have held, and I agree, that <u>an appellate court should not interfere with the issuing judge’s exercise of discretion unless it is shown that the issuing judge acted unjudicially or that the ruling resulted in an injustice</u>.

Kestenberg </i>(1959), 126 C.C.C. 387 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1960] S.C.R. x; and <i>R. v. Grondkowski </i>(1946), 31 Cr. App. R. 116 (C.A.), at pp. 119‑20). These two grounds involve different inquiries. While the determination of whether the judge acted unjudicially calls for an inquiry into the circumstances prevailing at the time it was made, the review of whether the ruling resulted in an injustice will usually entail scrutiny that includes the unfolding of the trial and of the verdicts (<i>R. v. Rose</i> (1997), 100 O.A.C. 67, at para. 17).</p>

line-height:200%">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ultimate question faced by a trial judge in deciding whether to grant a severance application is whether severance is required in the interests of justice, as per s. 591(3) of the <i>Code</i>. The interests of justice encompass the accused’s right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society’s interest in seeing that justice is done in a reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. The obvious risk when counts are tried together is that the evidence admissible on one count will influence the verdict on an unrelated count.</p>

The weighing exercise ensures that a reasonable balance is struck between the risk of prejudice to the accused and the public interest in a single trial.&nbsp; It is important to recall that the interests of justice often call for a joint trial.&nbsp; <i>Litchfield</i>, where the Crown was prevented from arguing the case properly because of an unjudicial severance order, is but one such example. Severance can impair not only efficiency but the truth-seeking function of the trial.</p>

With respect to the first requirement, the Crown submits that it should be open to a trial judge to give little or no weight to a simple assertion on the part of an accused of an intention to testify on some counts and not others. The Crown rejects a test that would make the assertion of an intention to testify a determining factor. With respect to the second requirement, the Crown notes that the burden lies with the accused to convince the trial judge on the balance of probabilities that the interests of justice require severance.

This requirement is, indeed, a threshold. The accused’s expression should have both a subjective and an objective component. However, while a formulaic expression of a subjective intention is not sufficient in and of itself to discharge the accused’s burden to have the counts severed, the trial judge should not substitute his or her own view for that of the accused and determine that the accused should testify or not. Rather, the trial judge must simply satisfy him- or herself that the circumstances objectively establish a rationale for testifying on some counts but not others. The burden on the accused is to provide the trial judge with sufficient information to convey that, objectively, there is substance to his testimonial intention.&nbsp; The information could consist of the type of potential defences open to the accused or the nature of his testimony: <i>Cross</i>, at p. 421. However, the accused is not bound by his stated intention; he remains free to control his defence, as the case unfolds, in a manner he deems appropriate.</p>

An accused’s stated and objectively justifiable intention to testify on some but not all counts is not necessarily determinative of a severance application. It can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying, or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests of justice require a joint trial.</p>

Defence counsel at trial did not further elaborate on Mr. Last’s position, other than to say that the M.A. counts were “dependent more heavily on other evidence”.&nbsp; However, the suggestion before the Court of Appeal and this Court was that Mr. Last was less likely to testify with respect to the M.A. counts since they involved an issue of identification.</p>

The Crown’s evidence implicating Mr. Last on the M.A. counts was not insignificant given Mr. Last’s admission that he was in her apartment just prior to the assault and M.A.’s identification of Mr. Last as her assailant. It was thus fairly probable he would have to testify in order to put forward his theory of the case — that it was someone else who entered M.A.’s apartment and committed the assault.

The trial judge found there was a nexus in time and place between the two sets of charges because the two assaults giving rise to the charges occurred in the city of London, approximately one month apart.

The fact that the two incidents occurred in London approximately one month apart is of very limited significance in this case. This was the city where Mr. Last resided and worked. The attacks on the women were not closely connected in any meaningful way. While the charges were similar, the theory of the defence was completely different: consent was at issue in one and identification in the other. The theory of the Crown that the two incidents were part of the same transaction was not supported by the facts. Rather, the attacks were separate incidents.&nbsp; The trier of fact would not need to know about one in order to understand the other. The circumstances surrounding the charges were not sufficiently similar in character to have supported a similar fact evidence application. Accordingly, there was no truth‑seeking interest in trying the counts together.</p>

However, in view of the different burden in a similar fact evidence application, the issue has to be considered carefully in the context of a severance motion. As said in <i>R. v.

Nevertheless, the trial judge should be careful not to confuse admissibility with severance. A motion to sever under s. 591(3)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Code</i> must be brought by the accused, who bears the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that the interests of justice require an order for severance. Yet the burden of demonstrating that similar fact evidence should be admitted must be borne by the Crown. These respective burdens may involve the consideration of similar factors, but as Lord Scarman noted in <i>R. v. Scarrott </i>(1977), 65 Cr. App. R. 125 (C.A.), at p. 135, “[i]t does not follow that because a multi‑count indictment has been allowed to proceed that therefore the evidence given will be evidence on all the counts contained in the indictment”. Thus, to paraphrase the Manitoba Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Khan </i>(1996), 49 C.R. (4th) 160, at p. 167, notwithstanding the trial judge’s refusal to sever the counts in a multi‑count indictment, it remains open to him or her, as the evidence progresses at trial, to determine as a matter of law that evidence on one count is not admissible as similar fact evidence on the other counts. The assessment of similar fact evidence and the determination of its probative value and admissibility places an onerous burden on the trial judge. It is a task that must be undertaken with great care.</p>

line-height:200%">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, an issue facing the trial judge at the time of the severance hearing was the fact that the Crown indicated that it wanted to wait until the conclusion of its evidence before making a similar fact evidence application. There is no procedural rule requiring the Crown to bring the similar fact evidence application at the time of the severance application: see D. Watt, <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Evidence </i>(2009), at §&nbsp;34.02. Given that the assessment of the similar fact evidence application can be a difficult task, in many cases such an assessment may be best done once all of the Crown’s evidence has been tendered. However, in this case, the acts complained of did not come close to having the requisite “high degree of similarity” that would have rendered “the likelihood of coincidence objectively improbable”:<i> Arp</i>, at para. 43; see also <i>R. v. Handy</i>, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908. Therefore it was clear at the severance motion that a similar fact application was not likely to succeed. Indeed, in his reasons, the trial judge did not rely on the possibility of a similar fact evidence application for denying severance.</p>

First, the joinder created the potential for cross‑pollination on credibility assessments. The existence of two complainants who had no relation to each other alleging two separate incidents of sexual assault created a risk that the credibility of each complainant would be bolstered. Similarly, if the jury found Mr. Last not credible while testifying with respect to one set of counts, the jury might presume that he was also not credible with respect to the other.&nbsp; Second, the joinder created a risk that the jury would engage in prohibited propensity reasoning. If the jury were to find that the Crown had satisfied the burden of proof for one set of offences, the jury might infer that Mr. Last was the kind of person who would commit these types of crimes and thereby convict him of the second set of offences.&nbsp;</p>

The Crown notes that the nature of both the proceedings and the evidence was relatively simple and straightforward. Since the cases did not involve similar fact evidence, the jury would not be instructed to pool the evidence on one set of counts with the evidence from the other set, and could therefore easily maintain the evidence in each case strictly separate.</p>

The severity of the injuries in M.A.’s case and the telling pictural representation of those injuries, together with the testimonies of the experts, made the evidence in this case much more visual than in S.M.’s case. On the other hand, the alleged threat with a gun and repeated sexual assault on the night of S.M.’s 19th birthday with the ensuing inherent psychological and emotional distress, if joined with the counts in M.A.’s case, seriously invited the possibility that the jury would engage in impermissible credibility bolstering and prohibited propensity reasoning. As pointed out by defence counsel, the jury would inevitably wonder why two complainants who did not know each other would independently accuse Mr. Last of sexual assault. Furthermore, if the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Last had committed sexual assault on one victim, the jury would be inclined to reason that Mr. Last had the propensity for committing this type of offence and convict on the other. Indeed, the trial judge implicitly recognized the potential prejudice to the accused, but felt that he could cure any resulting prejudice with a limiting instruction (A.R., at p. 79). &nbsp;I will later comment further on the limiting instruction.</p>

Finally, he observed that “[t]he purpose of joining counts, of course, is to avoid multiplicity, and it would be a rare thing for that criterion alone to tell in favour of severance” (A.R., at p. 80). This last statement, in my view, does not come close to the analysis of the benefits to the administration of justice mandated on a severance application.</p>

line-height:200%">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was incumbent upon the trial judge to consider and weigh cumulatively all the relevant factors to determine whether the interests of justice require severance. In this case, although Mr. Last was likely to testify on both incidents, the risk of prejudice to Mr. Last in having a joint trial was nevertheless significant because of the dangers of credibility cross‑pollination and prohibited propensity reasoning. In other circumstances, after balancing all relevant factors, the interests of justice may have nevertheless required a joint trial. However, in this case, there was an absence of compelling countervailing reasons for having a joint trial. This case did not pose a risk of inconsistent verdicts, nor did it involve substantial overlap in witness testimony or other evidence. As stated by the dissenting judge, “the nature of the nexus between the counts in this case did not provide a reason why it was necessary, desirable or convenient to try the cases together” (para. 130). Indeed, a joint trial in the circumstances of this case did not serve any truth‑seeking interest, and brought few if any benefits to the administration of justice.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.35pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

While a limiting instruction can <i>limit</i> the risk of inappropriate cross-pollination or propensity reasoning, courts should not resort to a limiting instruction unless there is a valid reason to do so.&nbsp; As with the accused’s intention to testify, the limiting instruction is but one factor in the balancing exercise.</p>

Failing to conduct a proper balancing of the relevant factors, the trial judge made an unreasonable decision.

The Crown has not discharged its burden in this case. The evidence largely consists in testimonies that need to be appreciated by the triers of the facts and the evidence, viewed as a whole, does not allow the Court to conclude that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.&nbsp; Consequently, this case is not one where the curative proviso should be applied.</p>
