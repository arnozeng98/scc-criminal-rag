Since jurors are presumed to be impartial, in order to rebut the presumption of impartiality, a party must call evidence or ask the trial judge to take judicial notice of facts, or both.&nbsp; In addition, the judge may draw inferences from events that occur in the proceedings and may make common sense inferences about how certain biases, if proved, may affect the decision‚Äëmaking process.&nbsp; The accused did not call any evidence in support of his application but relied heavily on proof by judicial notice. The threshold for judicial notice is strict:&nbsp; a court may properly take judicial notice of facts that are either:&nbsp; (1) so notorious or generally accepted as not to be the subject of debate among reasonable persons; or (2) capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here, the material presented by the accused falls short of grounding judicial notice of widespread bias in Canadian society against an accused in sexual assault trials.&nbsp; First, while the widespread nature of abuse and its potentially traumatic impact are not disputed, widespread victimization, standing alone, fails to establish widespread bias that might lead jurors to discharge their task in a prejudicial and unfair manner.&nbsp; Second, strong views about a serious offence do not ordinarily indicate bias and nothing in the material supports the contention, nor is it self‚Äëevident, that an exception arises in the case of sexual assaults on children.&nbsp; Third, there was also no proof that widespread myths and stereotypes undermine juror impartiality.&nbsp; While stereotypical beliefs might incline some jurors against an accused, it is not notorious or indisputable that they enjoy widespread acceptance in Canadian society.&nbsp; Fourth, although crimes arouse deep and strong emotions, one cannot automatically equate strong emotions with an unfair and prejudicial bias against the accused.&nbsp; Jurors are not expected to be indifferent toward crimes.&nbsp; Strong emotions are common to the trial of many serious offences and have never grounded a right to challenge for cause.&nbsp; The proposition that sexual offences are generically different from other crimes in their tendency to arouse strong passions is debatable, and does not, therefore, lend itself to judicial notice.&nbsp; Fifth, the survey of past challenge for cause cases involving sexual offences does not, without more, establish widespread bias arising from sexual assault charges.&nbsp; The number of prospective jurors disqualified, although relied on as support for judicial notice of widespread bias, is equally consistent with the conclusion that the challenge processes disqualified prospective jurors for acknowledging the intense emotions, beliefs, experiences and misgivings anyone might experience when confronted with the prospect of sitting as a juror on a case involving charges of sexual offences against children.&nbsp; Lastly, the theory of ‚Äúgeneric prejudice‚Äù against accused persons in sexual assault trials has not been proved, nor could judicial notice be taken of the proposition that such prejudice exists.&nbsp; While judicial notice could be taken of the fact that sexual crimes are almost universally abhorred, this does not establish widespread bias arising from sexual assault trials.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Although the accused failed to satisfy the first branch of the test for partiality, it is prudent to consider the second branch, as the two parts are not watertight compartments.&nbsp; It is open to a trial judge reasonably to infer, in the absence of direct evidence, that some strains of bias by their very nature may prove difficult for jurors to identify and eliminate from their reasoning.&nbsp; The strength of the inference varies with the nature of the bias in issue, and its amenability to judicial cleansing. Fundamental distinctions exist between racial bias and the more general bias relating to the nature of the offence itself.&nbsp; Firstly, racial bias may impact more directly on a jury‚Äôs decision than bias stemming from the nature of the offence because it is directed against a particular class of accused by virtue of an identifiable immutable characteristic.&nbsp; Secondly, trial safeguards may be less successful in cleansing racial prejudice because of its subtle, systemic and often unconscious operation.&nbsp; Bias directed toward the nature of the offence, however, is more susceptible to cleansing by the rigours of the trial process because it is more likely to be overt and acknowledged.&nbsp; The trial judge is more likely to address these concerns in the course of directions to the jury.&nbsp; Moreover, many of the safeguards the law has developed may be seen as a response to this type of bias.&nbsp; In the absence of evidence that strongly held beliefs or attitudes may affect jury behaviour in an unfair manner, it is difficult to conclude that they could not be cleansed by the trial process.&nbsp; It is speculative to assume that jurors will act on their beliefs to the detriment of an accused, in violation of their oath or affirmation, the presumption of innocence and the directions of the trial judge.&nbsp; As well, absent evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to believe that stereotypical attitudes about accused persons charged with a crime of a sexual nature are more elusive of the cleansing measures than stereotypical attitudes about complainants.&nbsp; It follows that such myths and stereotypes, even if widespread, provide little support for any inference of a behavioural link between these beliefs and the potential for juror partiality.&nbsp; Finally, absent evidence, it is highly speculative to suggest that the emotions surrounding sexual crimes will lead to prejudicial and unfair juror behaviour.&nbsp; The safeguards of the trial process and the instructions of the trial judge are designed to replace emotional reactions with rational, dispassionate assessment.&nbsp; Our long experience in the context of the trial of other serious offences suggests that our faith in this cleansing process is not misplaced.&nbsp; The accused failed to establish that sexual offences give rise to a strain of bias that is uniquely capable of eluding the cleansing effect of trial safeguards.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The trial judge, in a brief oral ruling, dismissed the application on the basis that it simply ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt fall anywhere near the dicta of the Court of Appeal in <i>Regina v.

The Crown raises a number of concerns:</span> the survey is entirely anecdotal, not comprehensive or random; not all of the questions asked of prospective jurors are indicated; there is no way in which to assess the directions, if any, provided by the trial judge, especially in relation to the distinction between strong opinions or emotions and partiality; and no comparative statistics are provided contrasting these results with the experience in other criminal law contexts.&nbsp; The intervener CLA concedes that the survey falls short of scientific validity, but contends that <span style="font-family:Shruti">it</span> nevertheless documents a phenomena of considerable significance.&nbsp; Hundreds of prospective jurors disqualified on the grounds of bias by impartial triers of fact must, it is argued, <span style="font-family:Shruti">displace the presumption of juror impartiality. Nonetheless, the lack of methodological rigour and the absence of expert evidence undermine the suggestion that the Ontario experience establishes widespread bias.</span></p>

Traditional myths and stereotypes have long tainted the assessment of the conduct and veracity of complainants in sexual assault cases </span>‚Äì<span style="font-family:Shruti"> the belief that women of </span>‚Äú<span style="font-family:Shruti">unchaste</span>‚Äù<span style="font-family:Shruti"> character are more likely to have consented or are less worthy of belief; that passivity or even resistance may in fact constitute consent; and that some women invite sexual assault by reason of their dress or behaviour, to name only a few.&nbsp; Based on overwhelming evidence from relevant social science literature, this Court has been willing to accept the prevailing existence of such myths and stereotypes: see, for example, <i>Seaboyer</i>, </span><i>supra</i>; <i>R. v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 59<span style="font-family:Shruti">5, at pp. 669-71; <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at paras. 94-97. </span></p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">102<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Child complainants<span style="font-family:Shruti"> may similarly be subject to stereotypical assumptions, such as the belief that stories of abuse are probably fabricated if not reported immediately, or that the testimony of children is inherently unreliable: <i>R. v. W. (R.)</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122; <i>R. v. D.D.</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275, 2000 SCC 43; N. Bala, "Double Victims: Child Sexual Abuse and the Canadian Criminal Justice System", in W. S. Tarnopolsky, J.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>

line-height:24.4pt"><span style="font-family:Shruti">104<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet the prevalence of such attitudes has never <span style="font-family:Shruti">been held to justify challenges for cause as of right by Crown prosecutors. Instead, we have traditionally trusted the trial process to ensure that such attitudes will not prevent jurors from acting impartially.&nbsp; We have relied on the rules of evidence, statutory protections, and guidance from the judge and counsel to clarify potential misconceptions and promote a reasoned verdict based solely on the merits of the case.</span></p>

line-height:24.4pt">108<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that even if widespread bias were established, we cannot safely infer<span style="font-family:Shruti">, on the record before the Court,</span> that it would lead to unfair, prejudicial and partial juror behaviour.&nbsp; This is not to suggest that an accused can never be prejudiced by the mere fact of the nature and circumstances of the charges he or she faces; rather, the inference between social attitudes and jury behaviour is simply far less obvious and compelling in this context, and more may be required to satisfy a court that this inference may be reasonably drawn.&nbsp; <span style="font-family:Shruti">The nature of offence-based bias, as discussed, suggests that the circumstances in which it is found to be both widespread in the community and resistant to the safeguards of trial may prove exceptional.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I would not foreclose the possibility that such circumstances may arise.&nbsp; I</span>f widespread bias arising from sexual assault were established in a future case, it would be for the court in that case to determine <span style="font-family:Shruti">whether this bias gives rise to a realistic potential for partial juror conduct in the community from which the jury pool is drawn.</span>&nbsp; I would only caution that in deciding whether to draw an inference of adverse effect on jury behaviour the court should take into account the nature of the bias and its susceptibility to cleansing by the trial process.</p>
