Therefore, in cases where identity is at issue and the accused is shown to have committed acts with a striking similarity to the alleged crime the jury is not asked to infer from the accused‚Äôs habits or disposition that he or she is the type of person who would commit the crime.&nbsp; Instead the jury is asked to infer from the distinctiveness or uniqueness that exists between the manner in which the crime under consideration was committed and the similar act that the accused is the very person who committed the crime.&nbsp; This inference is made possible only if the high degree of similarity between the acts renders the likelihood of coincidence objectively improbable.&nbsp; Once this preliminary determination is made, the evidence related to similar fact (or count, in a multi-count indictment) may be admitted to prove the commission of another act (or count).</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Several suggestions were put forward to assist judges in their approach to similar fact evidence.&nbsp; Where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity, a high degree of similarity between the acts is required since in order to be admissible the similar fact evidence must have the requisite probative value necessary to outweigh its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; The similarity between the acts may consist of a unique trademark or signature on a series of significant similarities.&nbsp; In assessing the similarity of the acts, the trial judge should only consider the manner in which the acts were committed and not the evidence as to the accused‚Äôs involvement in each act.&nbsp; There may well be exceptions but as a general rule, if upon assessing the similarity of the acts in this manner, the trial judge is satisfied that there is such a degree of similarity between the acts that they were likely committed by the same person, the similar fact evidence will ordinarily have sufficient probative force to outweigh its prejudicial effect and may be admitted.&nbsp; The jury will then be able to consider all the evidence related to the alleged similar acts in determining the accused‚Äôs guilt for any one act.&nbsp; The test for admissibility of similar fact evidence adduced to prove identity is the same whether the alleged similar acts are definitively attributed to the accused, or are the subject of a multi‚Äëcount indictment against the accused.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Where the similar acts are alleged as part of a multi‚Äëcount indictment, the consideration of the admissibility of similar fact evidence must be taken into account in deciding whether the counts should be severed.&nbsp; A motion to sever must be brought by the accused, who bears the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that the interests of justice require an order for severance.&nbsp; The burden of demonstrating that similar fact evidence should be admitted must be borne by the Crown.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Where the similar fact evidence adduced to prove identity suggests that the same person committed the similar acts, then logically this finding makes the evidence linking the accused to each similar act relevant to the issue of identity for the offence being tried. Similarly, in a multi‚Äëcount indictment, the link between the accused and any one count will be relevant to the issue of identity on the other counts which disclose a striking similarity in the manner in which those offences were committed<i>.</i></span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A link between the accused and the alleged similar acts is also a precondition to admissibility.&nbsp; The evidence linking the accused to the similar acts does not have to link the acts to the accused as well.&nbsp; Once the trial judge has concluded that the similar acts were likely committed by one person and there is evidence linking the accused to the acts it is not necessary to conclude that the acts were likely committed by the accused.&nbsp; This question must be determined by the trier of fact on the basis of all the evidence relating to the acts.&nbsp; Evidence of mere opportunity showing no more than the possibility that the similar act is that of the accused will not suffice to show the accused‚Äôs participation in the alleged similar act.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The proper standard to apply to the primary inference drawn from the similar fact evidence is proof on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; Since the probative value of similar fact evidence, as circumstantial evidence, lies in the unlikelihood of coincidence, it simply does not make sense to require one of the allegations to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt as a prerequisite to the trier of fact‚Äôs consideration of it.&nbsp; Though the similar fact evidence, standing alone, may fall short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it can be relied upon to assist in proving another allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (The general rule that preliminary findings of fact may be determined on a balance of probabilities is departed from in those certainly rare occasions when admission of the evidence may itself have a conclusive effect with respect to guilt.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The correct approach to a consideration of similar fact evidence by a jury is therefore the ‚Äúcumulative‚Äù or ‚Äúpooling‚Äù approach.&nbsp; Thus, as a general rule where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity, the jury should be instructed that once they have concluded that there is sufficient likelihood that the same person committed the alleged similar acts, they may consider all the evidence relating to the similar acts in considering whether the accused is guilty of the act in question. </span></p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">This view of similar fact evidence posits a test which is related to, yet distinct from the general rule that evidence is not admissible if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value:&nbsp; see <i>R. v. Wray</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 272.&nbsp; That rule is an exclusionary rule applied to evidence which would otherwise be admissible.&nbsp; The reverse is the case with similar fact evidence.&nbsp; In determining its admissibility, one starts from the proposition that the evidence is inadmissible, given the low degree of probative force and the high degree of prejudice typically associated with it.&nbsp; The question then is whether, because of the exceptional probative value of the evidence under consideration in relation to its potential prejudice, it should be admitted notwithstanding the general exclusionary rule.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">This review of the jurisprudence leads me to the following conclusions as to the law of similar fact evidence as it now stands in Canada.&nbsp; The analysis of whether the evidence in question is admissible must begin with the recognition of the general exclusionary rule against evidence going merely to disposition.&nbsp; As affirmed in <i>Boardman</i> and reiterated by this Court in <i>Guay</i>, <i>Cloutier</i>, <i>Morris</i>, <i>Morin</i> and <i>D. (L.E.)</i>, evidence which is adduced solely to show that the accused is the sort of person likely to have committed an offence is, as a rule, inadmissible.&nbsp; Whether the evidence in question constitutes an exception to this general rule depends on whether the probative value of the proposed evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; In a case such as the present, where the similar fact evidence sought to be adduced is prosecution evidence of a morally repugnant act committed by the accused, the potential prejudice is great and the probative value of the evidence must be high indeed to permit its reception.&nbsp; The judge must consider such factors as the degree of distinctiveness or uniqueness between the similar fact evidence and the offences alleged against the accused, as well as the connection, if any, of the evidence to issues other than propensity, to the end of determining whether, in the context of the case before him, the probative value of the evidence outweighs its potential prejudice and justifies its reception.</p>

The Queen</i> (1988), 165 C.L.R. 292 (Aust. H.C.).&nbsp; That is, there is always a possibility that by coincidence the perpetrator of the crime and the accused share certain predilections or that the accused may become implicated in crimes for which he is not responsible.&nbsp; However, where the evidence shows a distinct pattern to the acts in question, the possibility that the accused would repeatedly be implicated in strikingly similar offences purely as a matter of coincidence is greatly reduced.&nbsp; Sopinka J. in <i>Morin</i>, <i>supra</i>, where similar fact evidence was used to prove identity, made this point clear (at p.&nbsp;367):</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">In similar fact cases it is not sufficient to establish that the accused is a member of an abnormal group with the same propensities as the perpetrator.&nbsp; There must be some further distinguishing feature.&nbsp; Accordingly, if the crime was committed by someone with homosexual tendencies, it is not sufficient to establish that the accused is a practising homosexual or indeed has engaged in numerous homosexual acts.&nbsp; The tendered evidence must tend to show that there was some striking similarity between the manner in which the perpetrator committed the criminal act and such evidence.</p>

(M.H.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, left open the issue as to the standard of proof which should be applied by the trial judge where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity.&nbsp; In this regard, it must be remembered that the admissibility of similar fact evidence involves an analysis not normally undertaken by a trial judge.&nbsp; As a general rule, a trial judge will admit evidence shown to be relevant, and will not engage in an evaluation of the probative value or weight of the evidence.&nbsp; If the trial judge is called on to make a preliminary finding of fact as a precondition to admissibility, this finding is usually unrelated to the quality or reliability of the evidence itself.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Egger</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at p.&nbsp;474.&nbsp; Indeed, the judge must refrain from evaluating the quality, weight or reliability of evidence when determining admissibility since the weight to be given to evidence is properly the province of the jury.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Charemski</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 679.&nbsp; However, in determining the admissibility of similar fact evidence the trial judge must, to a certain extent, invade this province.&nbsp; As Professor Smith stated in Case and Comment on <i>R. v. Hurren</i>, [1962] <i>Crim. L. Rev.</i> 770, at p.&nbsp;771:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">It should be noted that judges commonly distinguish facts as going to weight rather than admissibility (see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>R.</i> v. <i>Wyatt</i>); but it is submitted that, as regards similar fact evidence, no sharp line can be drawn and that admissibility depends on weight.</p>

McWilliams, states in <i>Canadian Criminal Evidence</i> (3rd ed. 1988 (loose‚Äëleaf)), at p.&nbsp;11‚Äë26.1, ‚Äú[t]he link [to the accused] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is distinct from the link or <i>nexus</i> . . . which goes to the nature of the act and relates to its similarity or relevancy which is such as to overcome the general exclusionary rule‚Äù (emphasis in original).&nbsp; This distinction is made clear in Case and Comment on <i>R. v. Brown</i>, <i>Wilson, McMillan and McClean</i>, [1997] <i>Crim. L. Rev.</i> 502, at p.&nbsp;503 (as reported by Richard Percival):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(1)&nbsp; Generally where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity a high degree of similarity between the acts is required in order to ensure that the similar fact evidence has the requisite probative value of outweighing its prejudicial effect to be admissible.&nbsp; The similarity between the acts may consist of a unique trademark or signature on a series of significant similarities.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(2)&nbsp; In assessing the similarity of the acts, the trial judge should only consider the manner in which the acts were committed and not the evidence as to the accused‚Äôs involvement in each act.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">(3)&nbsp; There may well be exceptions but as a general rule if there is such a degree of similarity between the acts that it is likely that they were committed by the same person then the similar fact evidence will ordinarily have sufficient probative force to outweigh its prejudicial effect and may be admitted.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Scarrott</i> (1977), 65 Cr. App. R. 125 (C.A.), at p.&nbsp;135, ‚Äú[i]t does not follow that because a multi‚Äëcount indictment has been allowed to proceed that therefore the evidence given will be evidence on all the counts contained in the indictment‚Äù.&nbsp; Thus, to paraphrase the Manitoba Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Khan</i> (1996), 49 C.R. (4th) 160, at p.&nbsp;167, notwithstanding the trial judge‚Äôs refusal to sever the counts in a multi‚Äëcount indictment, it remains open to him or her, as the evidence progresses at trial, to determine as a matter of law that evidence on one count is not admissible as similar fact evidence on the other counts.&nbsp; The assessment of similar fact evidence and the determination of its probative value and admissibility places an onerous burden<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup>*</sup></span></a> on the trial judge.&nbsp; It is a task that must be undertaken with great care.</p>

White</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, at para. 44, citing <i>R. v. Bouvier</i> (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.), <i>per</i> Martin J.A., aff‚Äôd [1985] 2 S.C.R. 485.</p>

For example, in <i>R. v.

Dyment</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417.&nbsp; Where the police seek to obtain blood or hair samples from a suspect, the expectation of privacy with respect to bodily integrity is clear.&nbsp; Thus, where the police do not possess statutory authority to demand such a sample, it can only be taken with the consent of the suspect.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">In order for a waiver of the right to be secure against an unreasonable seizure to be effective, the person purporting to consent must be possessed of the requisite informational foundation for a true relinquishment of the right.&nbsp; A right to choose requires not only the volition to prefer one option over another, but also sufficient available information to make the preference meaningful. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">It was incumbent on the police, at a minimum, to make it clear to the respondent that they were treating his consent as a blanket consent to the use of the sample in relation to other offences in which he might be a suspect.&nbsp; I express no opinion on the question of whether there would have been a seizure if the intention of the police to use the sample in respect of the [earlier] assault case, and the subsequent appropriation of the sample for that purpose, did not exist until some time after the seizure of the blood for use in the [later] case. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Thus the general principle to be taken from <i>Borden</i> is that the scope of a valid consent may be limited by the extent of the accused‚Äôs knowledge and the information given to the accused as to the consequences of giving his consent.&nbsp; The majority specifically left open the issue raised by the appellant in this case.</p>
