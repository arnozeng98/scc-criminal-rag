The Queen </i>for the exercise of the discretion conferred by s.&nbsp;686(4) does not exhaust the definition of that discretion so as to preclude the Court, in appropriate circumstances, from adding to or qualifying the application of that test.&nbsp; Jurisprudence supports a limited discretion on the part of the Court of Appeal to decline to allow an appeal in some circumstances where the Crown unreasonably shuts down its case with the result that a verdict of acquittal is directed.&nbsp; Apart from the capacity to stay for abuse of process, an appellate court is entitled to consider whether the Crown has acted unreasonably in refusing to call further evidence at trial because of an adverse evidentiary ruling and can refuse to order a new trial in such circumstances.&nbsp; The threshold requirement is that, apart from the evidence excluded, the Crown's case was sufficient to be put to the jury.&nbsp; This threshold is met when the Crown's remaining evidence meets the essential elements of the offence, but the Crown chooses not to call that evidence.&nbsp; The final determination will depend upon a weighing of other factors, including the relative strength of the evidence not called, the relative importance of the evidence excluded by the impugned ruling, the degree of prejudice which further proceedings present to the accused and the reasons for the decision of the Crown not to call further evidence.</span></p>

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1964] 2 All E.R. 401, to hold that every court, regardless of whether it exercises civil or criminal jurisdiction, has an inherent discretionary power to prevent an abuse of process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.&nbsp; He cautioned, however, that such discretion should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances (at pp. 189-91).&nbsp; On appeal before our Court (<i>R. v. Osborn</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 184), three justices (Pigeon J., Martland and Judson JJ. concurring) held that no such discretion existed, three (Hall J., Ritchie and Spence JJ. concurring) held that it was not necessary to decide the question and the seventh, Fauteux J.

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys</i>, [1976] 2 All E.R. 497 (H.L.), would have recognized that criminal trial courts have an inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of their process, keyed to particular situations.&nbsp; Subsequent decisions of this Court have alluded in <i>obiter dicta</i> to the existence of a doctrine of abuse of process (<i>Erven v. The Queen</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 926, at p. 957 (<i>per</i> Pratte J.), <i>R. v. Krannenburg</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1053, at p. 1061 (<i>per</i> Dickson J.), and <i>Amato v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, at pp. 454-55 (<i>per </i>Estey J.)).&nbsp; In the wake of <i>Rourke</i>, <i>supra</i>, provincial appellate courts divided on the issue.&nbsp; Some applied <i>Rourke</i>, <i>supra</i>, and held that the doctrine of abuse of process was not available in criminal proceedings (<i>R. v. Lebrun</i> (1978), 7 C.R. (3d) 93 (B.C.C.A.)).&nbsp; Others applied the doctrine but restricted it to exceptional circumstances (<i>Re Ball and The Queen</i> (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 532 (Ont. C.A.), <i>Re Abarca and The Queen</i> (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 410 (Ont. C.A.), and <i>R. v. Young</i> (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.)).&nbsp; <i>R. v. Jewitt</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, put an end to the controversy by unanimously affirming the availability of the doctrine of abuse of process in criminal proceedings.&nbsp; The Court, at pp. 136-37, borrowed the comments of Dubin J.A. in <i>R. v. Young</i>, <i>supra</i>, that a stay of proceedings should be granted where "compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency" or where the proceedings are "oppressive or vexatious".&nbsp; The Court also adopted, at p. 137, "the caveat added by the [Ontario] Court [of Appeal] in <i>Young</i> that this is a power which can be exercised only in the `clearest of cases'".&nbsp; Dickson C.J., at pp. 132-33, reproduced in part the following comments of Viscount Dilhorne of the House of Lords in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 509 and p. 511:</span></p>

Keyowski</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, the Court unanimously reaffirmed the principle enunciated in <i>R. v. Jewitt</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; While she held that a stay of proceedings for abuse of process was not limited to cases where there is evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, Wilson J. for the Court, at p. 659, was careful to point out that the remedy will only be granted in the "clearest of cases".&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Mack</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, a stay of proceedings was entered on the basis that (<i>per</i> Lamer J., at p. 939) "in criminal law the doctrine of abuse of process draws on the notion that the state is limited in the way it may deal with its citizens".&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Conway</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, writing for the majority, I expressed the following view, at p. 1667:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Scott</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, <i>per </i>Cory J.&nbsp; See also <i>R. v. Potvin</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">This broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill‑suited to judicial review.&nbsp; Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake.</span></u><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp; Judicial supervision in this area, moreover, entails systemic costs of particular concern.&nbsp; Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the prosecutor's motives and decision-making to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the Government's enforcement policy.&nbsp; All these are substantial concerns that make the courts properly hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.&nbsp; [Emphasis added, in addition to material emphasized in original, from "Such factors . . . to undertake."]</span></p>

Frase ("The Decision to File Federal Criminal Charges: A Quantitative Study of Prosecutorial Discretion" (1979-1980), 47 <i>U. Chi. L.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">... (3) publication [in a judicial review, of the Crown's guidelines or policies] inevitably would result in more frequent attempts to invoke judicial review of prosecution policy and decisions, and such review would further clog an already overburdened criminal court system; and (4) if prosecutors knew that their policy would be published, they would be reluctant to formulate it, or to change it once it was formulated.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

This implied, according to the expert Dittmar, that, at the time of the accident, the respondent's alcohol level would have been between 185 and 210 mg/100 ml of blood.&nbsp; Thus, it appears that this evidence would have made possible a conclusive determination as to the impairment of the respondent and its influence on his driving ability since it showed clearly his blood alcohol level was over 100 mg/100 ml. </span></p>

The King</i>, [1947] S.C.R. 268.&nbsp; The amendment (S.C. 1953-54, c. 51) did not remove the discretion but left it undefined.&nbsp; Apparently, Parliament was content to leave it to the courts to define the circumstances in which the discretion was to be exercised.&nbsp; An appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, in contrast with an appeal by the accused from conviction, is a relatively unusual provision not common to all jurisdictions with systems similar to ours.&nbsp; It would, therefore, be appropriate for Parliament to accord more discretion to the courts as to the circumstances in which an error at trial should result in a new trial or conviction in an appeal by the Crown.</span></p>

Potvin</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at pp.&nbsp;915-16.&nbsp; In view of the conclusion that I have reached it is unnecessary for me to consider whether the conduct of the Crown in this case amounted to an abuse of process.</span></p>

Collins</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. 204 (Ont. C.A.), wherein Arbour&nbsp;J.A. concluded that in a jury case an appeal from a directed verdict of acquittal should generally be allowed if the trial judge erred in withdrawing the case from the jury on the basis of no evidence.&nbsp; Her reasons illustrate the difficulty in applying the <i>Vézeau</i> test in these circumstances.&nbsp; Not only must the court speculate as to what would have occurred if the case had not been withdrawn from the jury, but the Crown is effectively deprived of a jury trial in the event that the Court of Appeal concludes that an acquittal was inevitable.&nbsp; </span></p>

Smith</i> (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 285 (Alta. C.A.), and<i> R. v. Andres</i>, [1982] 2 W.W.R. 249 (Sask. C.A.).&nbsp; Even without the breathalyzer evidence, the Crown could have relied on the testimony of three witnesses who had been drinking with the respondent all afternoon and could identify the quantity of beer he had consumed and on the observations and opinions of two police officers as to the degree of intoxication of the respondent:&nbsp; <i>Graat v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819.&nbsp; Jeffrey Porter, Gordon Aylward and Glen McGrath all testified at the preliminary hearing that the respondent had consumed approximately six or seven bottles of beer in the three or four hour period before the accident occurred.&nbsp; Although both Porter and Aylward, who testified that they had consumed a similar amount of alcohol during the same time period, stated their opinion that the respondent was "okay" to drive, both Constables Stanley and Tilley testified at the preliminary hearing that, in their opinion, the bloodshot eyes, strong odour of alcohol and slurred speech of the respondent indicated that he was intoxicated.&nbsp; In fact, Constable Tilley, who performed the breathalyzer stated that it was his opinion, based on his observations of the respondent, that the respondent was well over the legal blood-alcohol limit for driving a motor vehicle.&nbsp; Moreover, the Crown could have introduced the evidence of its expert, Elizabeth Dittmar, with respect to the effects on driving ability of the quantity of alcohol consumed by a person the size of the respondent since she was a qualified expert in the field: <i>R. v. Dubois</i> (1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 90, and <i>R. v. Kucher</i> (1979), 48 C.C.C.

Pinske</i> (1988), 30 B.C.L.R. (2d) 114 (C.A.) at p. 123, aff'd, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 979.&nbsp; Of necessity, the issue of causation requires consideration of competing theories as to the explanation for occurrence of the accident which resulted in injury and death.&nbsp; The case at bar is no exception, since the evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry disclosed alternative possibilities with respect to causation: impaired driving capacity, poor road conditions and mechanical disrepair.&nbsp; However, I would reiterate that, in order to found the basis for a conviction, it need not be demonstrated that impairment was the <u>sole</u> cause, since it may well be that, even though a combination of factors were involved, impairment was still more than a <i>de minimis</i> cause of the death and injury which occurred:&nbsp; <i>Pinske, supra</i>.&nbsp; The evidence pertaining to the quantity of alcohol consumed by the respondent, as well as the observations and opinions of the police officers involved in the investigation, present a substantial body of evidence relating to impairment, which might have been augmented by the expert witness.&nbsp; The other evidence relating to the impact of poor road conditions must also be factored into the causation equation.&nbsp; Jeffrey Porter, one of the passengers in the vehicle allegedly driven by the respondent, testified at the preliminary hearing that, prior to impact, the rear of the vehicle began to slide and the eyewitness, William Keary, indicated that the vehicle slid around the corner before impact and that the road conditions were "damp".&nbsp; Moreover, Randolph Chafe, the mechanic who inspected the vehicle allegedly driven by the respondent after the accident gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry that the left rear tire of the vehicle was bald and the left brake lining worn off completely.&nbsp; While these circumstances tend to weaken the Crown's case, their weight was for the jury to assess.&nbsp; There was ample evidence to go to the jury.</span></p>
