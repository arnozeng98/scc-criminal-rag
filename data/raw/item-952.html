Morin</i>, this Court determined that a jury charge is in error if it leaves the jury with the impression that each item of evidence is to be considered piecemeal against the criminal standard of proof or if the jury is instructed to take a two-stage approach to their deliberations, whereby an initial fact-finding stage would weed out certain items of evidence, leaving the determination of guilt or innocence to be based only on the surviving evidence.&nbsp; In the case at bar, there was no general instruction to apply the criminal standard of proof to items of evidence in isolation.&nbsp; While the charge does focus on one item of evidence, namely the accused's statement to the police, the direction on this evidence is carefully couched in terms of all the other evidence in the case.&nbsp; The charge does not instruct the jury to divide its deliberations into two phases, and there was almost no chance for the jury to form the impression that "the whole of the evidence" was intended to mean only the whole of the piecemeal bits of evidence already proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contradiction between the accused's outâofâcourt statement and his testimony at trial was a key issue in the case, and the trial judge was entitled to give the jury some guidance on how to handle this discrepancy in the evidence.&nbsp; As a matter of logic, the two stories could not be reconciled, and the judge's suggestion that one of the statements must be "rejected", couched as it was with the proviso that all of the other evidence must be taken into account, in no way prejudiced the Crown.&nbsp; The jury instruction was an accurate reflection of the principle enunciated by this Court in <i>Nadeau</i> that an accused's version of events is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as against a competing version, providing the comparison is made having due regard to all the evidence.&nbsp; It is both acceptable and desirable for a trial judge to focus the jury's attention on vital issues, and to direct their minds to the proper burden of proof on those discrete questions.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the statement "it will be considered by you with the other evidence that you decide to accept", read in isolation, may be viewed as an erroneous statement of the law, since it suggests that a determination of guilt should be based solely on certain preâselected items of evidence, read in context it would not have misdirected the jury.&nbsp; This statement follows the trial judge's direction to consider all the evidence in making a determination, and therefore could not be interpreted as invoking a twoâstage process.&nbsp; Consequently, the instruction to the jury is in keeping with the rule in <i>Morin</i> and was not in error.</span></p>

Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.&nbsp; In retrospect, it appears to me that confusion exists in two aspects of this area of the law:&nbsp; (i) the essential distinction between facts and evidence of facts in the process of the jury's deliberations, and (ii) the relationship between credibility and the standard of proof in a criminal trial.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, it is crucial to recognize the difference between the roles of "facts" and "evidence of facts" in a criminal trial; the failure to apply this basic distinction has confused the debate on this issue.&nbsp; As an example of this tendency, see R. Eggleston, <i>Evidence, Proof and Probability</i> (2nd ed. 1983), who at p. 122 begins talking of "facts that are not certainly established" but concludes with comments directed to the effect of "evidence" not being taken into account, and stating that a requirement to prove evidence beyond a reasonable doubt obviates the entire field of corroboration.&nbsp; As I state below, doubtful evidence may be corroborated by other evidence, even other doubtful evidence; doubtful facts, however, cannot be corroborated by, or inferred from, other doubtful facts.&nbsp; Throughout many discussions of this point, the terms "fact" and "evidence" are used interchangeably, and thereby improperly.&nbsp; It is beyond question that the jury must always consider the whole of the evidence in reaching their verdict, and that individual items of evidence are not to be examined in isolation.&nbsp; Evidence which may be doubtful standing alone may nevertheless be corroborated or otherwise supported by other evidence, and the jury is always to evaluate the evidence as a whole with a view to such corroboration or support.&nbsp; Therefore, it is an error to refer to the jury "rejecting" evidence at any stage of their deliberations.&nbsp; All of the evidence must always be considered.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the jury can and must decide whether the whole of evidence establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, the individual facts necessary to support a conviction.&nbsp; This must, of necessity, be done in a sequential manner, and I agree with La Forest J. that it is unrealistic to expect the jury to have an "epiphanic" experience in reaching its verdict.&nbsp; In <i>Morin</i>, Wilson J. stated (at p. 378) that the process of the jury's deliberations with respect to the Crown evidence "requires a fact elicited through the mouth of a witness to be assessed by the jury in the context of all the evidence and to be rejected if it has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt."&nbsp; Therefore, while the jury never rejects evidence, it can and must decide whether to accept or reject the factual assertions made by that evidence before it uses those factual assertions to support or infer other factual assertions towards reaching its verdict.&nbsp; Such factual assertions can only be accepted and used by the jury to convict the accused if they are established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Facts which are not so established cannot corroborate or be allowed to "bootstrap" other doubtful facts.&nbsp; Any lower standard would present the possibility that an accused could be convicted on the basis of facts which are established as matters of conjecture only.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An analogy I often used in charging juries, especially in cases where the Crown's case was circumstantial, was that of a fisherman's net.&nbsp; The evidence presented at trial by the Crown seeks to establish factual propositions.&nbsp; Once established, facts may be used to infer other facts.&nbsp; In this way, established factual propositions intertwine to construct a net of such propositions.&nbsp; If a factual proposition is established as a mere probability or likelihood, and not beyond a reasonable doubt, it cannot be used to infer any further facts.&nbsp; The interweaving of facts breaks down and there is a hole in the net.&nbsp; A net with a hole, however small, is no useful net at all, since there remains a critical factual proposition which is not consistent only with the accused's guilt.&nbsp; Thus, a fact which is not established beyond a reasonable doubt can play no part in the jury's decision to convict, either as a fact on which they rely to find an essential element of the offence, or as a fact used to infer such facts.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 570, in the passage cited by La Forest J. at pp. 27-28 of his reasons.</span></p>

Morin</i>, <i>supra</i>, as that decision looms large in the debate in the court below and before this Court.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Later in the charge, the trial judge stated that the doctrine of reasonable doubt did not apply to each individual item of evidence, but rather to the whole of the case and to "the total body of evidence".&nbsp; However, he then gave a series of instructions on particular items of evidence, each of which suggested that the criminal standard was to be applied, in isolation, to that item.&nbsp; For example, with regard to certain hair and fibre evidence, the trial judge said:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Sopinka J., writing for the majority, found that the charge as a whole was misleading to the jury.&nbsp; He commented as follows, at p. 356:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Sopinka J. rejected the argument that the trial judge's second instruction cured the erroneous impression left by the first (at p. 356):</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The second excerpt refers to the "whole of the case" and the "total body of evidence".&nbsp; Having been told earlier that the "whole" upon which the verdict was to be based consisted of the evidence that had been accepted, I am not satisfied that the jury would have interpreted this passage as a correction.&nbsp; Rather, they might very well have assumed that the earlier definition of the "whole" still applied.&nbsp; At best, from the appellant's standpoint the jury would be confused.&nbsp; Subsequent passages in the charge illustrate what is meant by the first excerpt and would confirm that individual pieces of evidence were to be examined by reference to the criminal standard.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">Thus, the reversible error in <i>Morin</i> arose from the combined effect of two misdirections.&nbsp; The first was that the jury should assess the evidence in piecemeal fashion.&nbsp; This was exacerbated by the instruction to break the jury deliberations into two stages.&nbsp; In the end, Sopinka J. concluded, at p. 358:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">With these findings from <i>Morin</i> in mind, I turn now to the jury charge in the present case.</span></p>

Thatcher</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at pp. 700-701.&nbsp; In my view, this is exactly what the trial judge has done in the present case.&nbsp; As Freeman J.A. commented in the court below, at p. 134, "... the words of Mr. Justice MacIntosh referred to above, to say nothing of his instructions as a whole, would have left the jury in a state of mind no different than if he had charged them in the words of Mr. Justice Lamer in <i>Nadeau</i>."</span></p>

Gauthier</i>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 441, in which this Court found that it is for the jury, after a <i>voir dire</i>, to decide whether a confession had in fact been made.&nbsp; That seems to me to be a complete answer to the respondent's argument.</span></p>

Demeter</i> (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 417, at p. 436, there will "probably never be a perfect charge or one that cloistered appellate counsel cannot find objectionable after minute scrutiny."&nbsp; Simply put, the charge to the jury must be read as a whole, bearing in mind the heavy onus that rests with the Crown to establish that the jury's verdict may have been affected by the impugned passage:&nbsp; <i>VÃ©zeau v. The Queen</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.&nbsp; In that light it is clear to me that MacIntosh&nbsp;J.'s charge, when viewed as a whole, was not misleading to the jury.</span></p>
