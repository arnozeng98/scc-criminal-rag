Grant</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>R. v. Thomsen</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; I would simply note that in neither of those cases did this Court turn its mind to contexts in which the delay resulted from the exercise of an abundance of reasonable care.&nbsp; Where the police wait in order to ensure the accuracy of the screening test, this waiting period can only benefit the driver, since it virtually eliminates the possibility that he or she will blow a false "fail" and be taken in for a breathalyzer on an erroneous basis.&nbsp; I cannot help but observe that the admission of breathalyzer evidence obtained under such circumstances, even if it were obtained in violation of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, could hardly be seen to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.&nbsp; </span></p>
