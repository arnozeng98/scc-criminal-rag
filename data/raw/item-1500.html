Part of this discretion involves the choice of which witnesses to call.&nbsp; Given the strong preference this Court has shown for deferring to the Crown’s discretionary authority, it would take a strong opposing rationale to warrant the creation of a duty which so clearly impedes it.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The term “essential to the . . . narrative” in <i>Lemay v. The King </i>does not mean that all witnesses with relevant testimony have to be called by the prosecution.&nbsp; The jurisprudence does not suggest such an imposition.&nbsp; The term refers only to the Crown’s burden of proof in a criminal proceeding.&nbsp; Where the “narrative” is not adequately set forth, elements of the offence might not be properly proven and the Crown risks losing its case.&nbsp; Additionally, whether or not witnesses have been called is a factor appellate courts can consider in reviewing a decision as to the reasonableness of its verdict. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The&nbsp; main ground for opposing the Crown’s discretionary authority to call witnesses has historically been that of fairness.&nbsp; Three factors affecting fairness were&nbsp; raised:&nbsp; that the Crown’s not calling witnesses would cause a trial by ambush, that the ability to cross-examine would be lost and that an accused would be deprived of the right to address the jury last. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Since the Crown must now disclose relevant information it possesses (<i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>), the defence cannot now be “ambushed” in the sense that it was unaware of potentially exculpatory evidence discovered by the Crown or even of material inconsistencies. These developments have extinguished any rationale compelling the Crown to call witnesses based on the need to bring all material facts forward. The accused is not “ambushed” by the fact that a given witness is not called; any existing unfairness can be resolved through the disclosure process and the accused’s ability to call the witness.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The contemporaneous cross‑examination of a witness is not necessary to guarantee a fair trial.&nbsp; There is no prejudice in the respondent’s not getting a free opportunity to cross‑examine every potential witness whether or not the Crown wished to call them. An accused concerned about a deprivation of the opportunity to cross‑examine can rely, in an appropriate case, on the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; In the rare case the tactical disadvantage to the defence of calling a potentially hostile witness would be manifestly unfair, the trial judge would be entitled to consider this as a factor in deciding whether to call the witness him‑ or herself.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A failure on the Crown’s part to call a witness which would result in prejudice to the accused because of loss of the choice to address the jury last should not affect the Crown’s discretion to produce the witnesses it chooses.&nbsp; Rather, the failure to call a witness can be a factor for the trial judge to consider in deciding whether or not to call the witness him‑ or herself.&nbsp; This is a preferable, flexible solution which allows the trial judge to balance the competing factors carefully and assess the actual prejudice to an accused rather than merely speculating about potential harm.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The testimony of the complainant or victim should not be treated any differently from that of any other witness.&nbsp; In the vast majority of cases, the Crown, where it adduces nothing at all from the complainant or victim, will need some other evidence of a compelling nature to establish the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; This burden will be even more difficult to overcome where there appears to be no good reason for refusing to call the witness.&nbsp; In many situations, legitimate questions would arise in the minds of the trier of fact where a victim was willing and able to testify, and yet without any explanation, was not called on behalf of the Crown.&nbsp; Still, there is no duty resting upon the Crown to call the witness.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The trial judge did not err in failing to inquire into why the Crown chose not to call the victim.&nbsp; The onus to prove the Crown’s misconduct lies upon the accused.&nbsp; Similarly, a finding of an abuse of process or “oblique motive” is only available where the accused can establish such conduct on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; The calling of witnesses by the trial judge is a matter to be left to each judge’s discretion and should be exercised in rare cases so as to avoid overly interfering with the adversarial nature of the proceedings.</span></p>

The first two charges <sup>__</sup> sexual assault while armed with a weapon and uttering death threats<sup> __</sup> concerned a woman,&nbsp; Lelayna&nbsp;Rebane, while the third<sup> __</sup> assault causing bodily harm <sup>__</sup> involved a separate male victim, Troy Dorbyson.&nbsp; After a one-day trial and nearly eight hours of deliberation, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charges involving Rebane.&nbsp; On the count of assault causing bodily harm, however, the respondent was convicted.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The remaining ground that the Crown failed to call a witness, Mrs. Yebes, essential to the unfolding of the narrative, must also fail in my view. <u>The Crown has a discretion as to which witnesses it will call in presenting its case to the court. This discretion will not be interfered with unless the Crown has exercised it for some oblique or improper reason: see <i>Lemay v. The King</i>, <i>supra</i>. No such improper motive is alleged here. While the Crown may not be required to call a given witness, the failure of the Crown to call a witness may leave a gap in the Crown's case which will leave the Crown's burden of proof undischarged and entitle the accused to an acquittal. It is in this sense that the Crown may be expected to call all witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative of events upon which the Crown's case is based</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

The Queen</i> (1983), 152 C.L.R. 657 (Austl. H.C.); <i>The Queen v. Apostilides</i> (1984), 154 C.L.R. 563 (Austl. H.C.).</p>

Once he has satisfied the obligation to disclose the evidence, it is for him, in principle, to choose the witnesses necessary to establish the factual basis of his case. If he does not call the necessary witnesses or evidence, he exposes the prosecution to dismissal of the charge for having failed to establish its case completely and in accordance with the reasonable doubt rule. <u>However, once this obligation has been met and if improper motives cannot be imputed to him, such as the desire, for example, to hide exculpatory evidence, as a general rule, he will be considered to have properly executed this part of his function in the criminal trial. The defence may, at that time, do its work and call its own witnesses, if it considers it appropriate to do so. In the tradition of the common law, on which Canadian criminal procedure is based, the case retains its adversarial nature and Crown counsel, while an officer of the court, does not act as defence counsel</u><i>. </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">I could not agree more.&nbsp; With respect, I fail to see why the defence should not have to call witnesses which are beneficial to its own case.&nbsp; The adversarial process functions on the premise that it is the obligation of the Crown to establish a case beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused.&nbsp; Once this threshold has been surpassed, however, it is up to the accused to call evidence or face conviction: <i>R. v. Noble</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874.&nbsp; The adversarial nature of&nbsp; the trial process has been recognized as a principle of fundamental justice (<i>R. v. Swain</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933).&nbsp; As such it should be construed in a way that strikes a fair balance between the interests of the accused and those of society: <i>R. v. Levogiannis</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475;<i> Cunningham v. Canada</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 143, at p. 148; <i>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.&nbsp; In my view, placing an obligation upon the Crown to call all witnesses with information bearing on the case would disrupt the inherent balance of our adversary system.&nbsp; I note, however, that the accused is also not <u>obliged</u> to call the witness.&nbsp; As I propose to expand upon, there are other options which are available to the accused in an appropriate case including, but not limited to, asking the trial judge to call the witness, commenting in closing on the witness’ absence, or asking the trial judge to comment.</p>

Guyatt </i>(1994), 35 C.R. (4th) 178 (B.C.S.C.); <i>R. v. Hutchinson</i> (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 88 (N.S.C.A.); <i>R. v. Rose (J.)</i> (1996), 90 O.A.C. 193, leave to appeal granted February 6, 1997 (S.C.C.).&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, it is not necessary to do so.&nbsp; It is clear that the degree to which an accused is prejudiced by the order of closing addresses will vary upon the facts of each case, and most importantly by whether or not he or she already planned to call witnesses.&nbsp; For this reason, I do not feel that this factor is sufficient to warrant impeding the Crown’s discretion to produce witnesses as the Crown chooses.&nbsp; Rather, as <i>Finta</i> points out, it can be a factor for the trial judge to consider in deciding whether or not to call the witness him- or herself.&nbsp; In my view, this is a preferable, flexible solution. &nbsp;This process allows the trial judge to balance the competing factors carefully and assess the actual prejudice to an accused rather than merely speculating about potential harm.&nbsp; As such, I believe this is the route which should be followed.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="1" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">64<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A mandatory inquiry into the reasons for which the Crown decided not to call the witness does not seem to be in keeping with the intent and spirit of <i>Finta</i>.&nbsp; While such an inquiry might be appropriate in a given case, I would leave that to the discretion of the trial judge.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">67<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the respondent has argued, although not particularly strenuously, that the Crown’s failure to call Dorbyson as a witness resulted in an “unsafe verdict” in that&nbsp; the “whole of the story” was not put before the jury.&nbsp; Essentially, he contends that this decision not to call Dorbyson makes it impossible to conclude that the Crown actually proved its case, and that the jury’s verdict to the contrary was an unreasonable one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unable to agree with this submission.&nbsp; After a review of the material which was admitted in this case, I am of the view that there was a great deal of evidence upon which a reasonably instructed jury could conclude that the respondent had committed the crime for which he was charged.</p>
