24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The pre‚Äë and post‚Äë<i>Pappajohn </i>authorities support a two‚Äëpronged question for determining whether there is an evidential foundation warranting that a defence be put to a jury.&nbsp; The question is whether there is (1) evidence (2) upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence to be true.&nbsp; The terms ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù, ‚Äúsome evidence‚Äù or ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù can be used to describe the applicable evidential standard, provided these terms are understood as elliptical references to the full question.&nbsp; The second part of this question can be rendered by asking whether the evidence put forth is reasonably capable of supporting the inferences required to acquit the accused.&nbsp; This is the current state of the law, uniformly applicable to all defences. </span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; The test upon which a trial judge must decide whether a defence has an ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù so as to be left to the jury only involves a determination of whether there is ‚Äúsome evidence‚Äù in support of the defence, and should not otherwise involve a measure of the sufficiency of that evidence.&nbsp; In other words, when examining whether&nbsp; there is evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could convict, it is the ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù test, rather than the ‚Äúsufficient evidence‚Äù test, which must be applied.&nbsp; The test should be substantially the same as the one applied to cases of directed verdicts of acquittal or motions for non‚Äësuit, as well as committal for trial under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec548subsec1" target="_blank">s. 548(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The test for committal for trial, directed verdicts of acquittal and the withdrawing of a defence from the jury strives to respect the long‚Äëstanding divisions of tasks between judges and jury, and favours great deference to the wisdom of the jury.&nbsp; Discharges at the preliminary inquiry and directed verdicts of acquittal also promote judicial economy and may serve as an early barrier to the danger of a wrongful conviction.&nbsp; Not so where a defence is withdrawn from the jury. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù test was never meant to lead to directed verdicts of conviction, but was mostly designed to avoid confusing the jury, particularly in cases of inconsistent alternative defences.&nbsp; Where only one defence is raised and guilt is otherwise admitted, if any real meaning is to be given to the right to a trial by jury, the application of the test should be strictly limited to situations where a technical evidentiary requirement necessary to fulfill the accused‚Äôs evidential burden for a specific defence is lacking, or when there is a complete absence of evidence on one or more of the essential ingredients of the defence.&nbsp; Only in those cases can it be said that the defence is not available in law, and only in this manner can the proper role of the jury be respected.&nbsp; It is important to distinguish cases where there is a complete lack of evidence from those cases where there is some evidence, but the court does not consider it strong enough to raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Especially where appellate review is involved, the ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù analysis, when applied to the sole defence raised and available to the accused, should focus only on the presence or absence of evidence, as opposed to its quality, sufficiency, or weight.&nbsp; </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The only principled and practical justification for withdrawing a defence is to avoid confusing the jury.&nbsp; When the requisite legal elements of a single defence are properly explained to the jury, there is little risk of confusion on the part of the jury solely because the evidence in support of the defence is weak and unpersuasive.&nbsp; The cost of risking a wrongful conviction and possibly violating the accused‚Äôs constitutionally protected rights by inadvisably withdrawing a defence from the jury is a high one.&nbsp; Since this Court has consistently been of the view that the possible advantages that would be gained by adopting a higher threshold for the test respecting directed verdicts of acquittal are not sufficient to justify a change in the test, then there is no possible justification for the adoption of a higher threshold in the ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù context, where such an adoption would involve fewer advantages and more risks.</span></p>

The core elements of the test, as well as its nature and purpose, have by now been clearly and authoritatively set out. See <i>R. v. Osolin</i>,<i> </i>[1993] 4 S.C.R. 595; <i>R. v.

More narrowly, the contentious issue is the correct evidential standard to be applied in determining whether there is an air of reality to the defence of self-defence on the facts of this case.</p>

The correct approach to the air of reality test is well established. The test is whether there is evidence on the record upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit. See <i>Wu v. The King</i>, [1934] S.C.R. 609;<i> R. v. Squire</i>,<i> </i>[1977] 2 S.C.R. 13; <i>Pappajohn v.

This long-standing formulation of the threshold question for putting defences to the jury accords with the nature and purpose of the air of reality test.&nbsp; We consider that there is nothing to be gained by altering the current state of the law, in which a single clearly-stated test applies to all defences. See <i>Osolin</i>, <i>supra</i>;&nbsp; <i>Park</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Finta</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; There is no need to invent a new test, to modify the current test, or to apply different tests to different classes of cases.</p>

This venerable rule reflects the practical concern that allowing a defence to go to the jury in the absence of an evidential foundation would invite verdicts not supported by the evidence, serving only to confuse the jury and get in the way of a fair trial and true verdict. Following <i>Pappajohn</i>, <i>supra</i>, the inquiry into whether there is an evidential foundation for a defence is referred to as the air of reality test.

First, a trial judge must put to the jury all defences that arise on the facts, whether or not they have been specifically raised by an accused.&nbsp; Where there is an air of reality to a defence, it should go to the jury.&nbsp; Second, a trial judge has a positive duty to keep from the jury defences lacking an evidential foundation. A defence that lacks an air of reality should be kept from the jury.<i>&nbsp; Wu</i>,<i> supra</i>;<i> Squire</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Pappajohn</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Osolin</i>,<i> supra</i>;<i> Davis</i>,<i> supra. </i><span lang="EN-GB">This is so even when the defence lacking an air of reality represents the accused‚Äôs only chance for an acquittal, as illustrated by <i>R. v.

Dickson C.J. drew attention to the distinction between these two types of burden in <i>R. v. Schwartz</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443, at p. 466:</p>

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">Judges and academics have used a variety of terms to try to capture the distinction between the two types of burdens. The burden of establishing a case has been referred to as the ‚Äú major burden,‚Äù the ‚Äúprimary burden,‚Äù the ‚Äúlegal burden‚Äù and the ‚Äúpersuasive burden.‚Äù <u>The burden of putting an issue in play has been called the ‚Äúminor burden,‚Äù the ‚Äúsecondary burden,‚Äù the ‚Äúevidential burden,‚Äù the ‚Äúburden of going forward,‚Äù and the ‚Äúburden of adducing evidence.</u>‚Äù [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The air of reality test is concerned only with whether or not a putative defence should be ‚Äúput in play‚Äù, that is, submitted to the jury for consideration.

That question is reserved for the jury. See<i> Finta</i>,<i> supra</i>; <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i>,<i> </i>[1999] 1 S.C.R. 330. The trial judge does not make determinations about the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, make findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences. See <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">This is no more than an example of the basic division of tasks between judge and jury. It is the judge who must determine if evidence sought to be adduced is relevant and admissible. In the same way, it is the judge who determines if there is sufficient evidence adduced to give rise to the defence. If there has been sufficient evidence put forward, then the jury must be given the opportunity to consider that defence along with all the other evidence and other defences left with them in coming to their verdict.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Indeed, the air of reality inquiry has been found not only to be consistent with the traditional division of labour as between judge and jury, but actually to <u>enhance</u> the jury‚Äôs ability to carry out its task.

Provided there was ‚Äúsome evidence‚Äù or ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù going to the elements of a defence ‚Äî or, stated negatively, unless there was ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù ‚Äî a defence had to be put to the jury. It is argued that the Court‚Äôs holding in <i>Pappajohn</i>,<i> supra</i>, changed all that by introducing a new and more onerous ‚Äúsufficiency of the evidence‚Äù requirement. This requirement is alleged to have licensed a judicial incursion into the traditional province of the jury. Finally, it is argued that the ‚Äúsufficient evidence‚Äù standard from <i>Pappajohn</i> ought to be understood as a special rule applicable to the defence of mistaken belief in consent in sexual assault cases, and that the purportedly traditional ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù rule ought to apply to all other defences, notably self-defence under s. 34(2).

The issue has remained the same, namely: whether a defence rests upon an evidential foundation warranting that it be put to a jury. Most significantly, the specific question to be asked by a trial judge in determining whether the threshold evidential burden for putting a defence to a jury is met, has remained constant. Cory J. stated the question in <i>Osolin</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at p. 682:</p>

Lamont J. held that the trial judge in that case was under no obligation to put the defences of self-defence or provocation to the jury. He set out the reasoning of the Court, at p. 617:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It is clear from the above-quoted paragraph that the requirement has two components: (1) there must be evidence&nbsp; (2) upon which a jury could reasonably draw the inferences necessary to acquit the accused.

The two-pronged statement of the test for determining whether a defence rests upon an evidential foundation ‚Äî in contemporary terms, whether it has an air of reality ‚Äî applies to this day.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Fauteux C.J. did not limit the question to whether the record was ‚Äúdenuded of any evidence‚Äù.&nbsp; Rather, the question was whether the record was denuded of any evidence <u>having the potential to enable a reasonable jury acting judicially to acquit</u>. Whether or not the evidence has this potential is a question for the trial judge. While courts have often spoken of an inquiry into whether there is ‚Äúsome evidence‚Äù or ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù without qualification, this must be understood as a short-form reference to the full question. The full question is whether there is evidence (some evidence, any evidence) upon which a properly instructed jury acting judicially could acquit. If there is <u>any</u> or <u>some</u> such evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is cleared. If there is <u>no</u> such evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is not cleared.&nbsp; In view of the frequent resort by courts to short-form expressions, it may be tempting to focus on the first part of the question (‚Äúthere must be some evidence‚Äù) to the exclusion of the crucial second part (‚Äúupon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit‚Äù).&nbsp; That this temptation must be resisted is made clear by the authorities.</p>

The accused had been convicted at trial.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that the defence of provocation should have been put to the jury. The Court allowed the appeal and restored the jury‚Äôs conviction. Spence J., for the Court, stated the familiar principle that it is the duty of the trial judge to put to the jury all defences arising from the evidence, whether or not they were argued by counsel to the jury. He then stated, at p. 19:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This statement makes it clear that the question of whether there is ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù is incomplete. As Spence J. explicitly states, it is necessary to consider whether the evidence is reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary for the defence to succeed.&nbsp; To the extent that the inferences required for the defence to succeed cannot reasonably be supported by the evidence, the defence lacks an evidential foundation ‚Äî it has no air of reality ‚Äî and should therefore not be put to the jury.</p>

There was evidence, in other words, capable of bearing an interpretation different from that suggested by Spence J.&nbsp; The contentious issue was not the bare existence or absence of ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù in some general sense, but rather whether that evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to acquit the accused.&nbsp; Indeed, Spence J.‚Äôs explanation of his reasoning, at pp. 21-22, demonstrates the way courts have analysed evidence in determining whether the threshold evidential burden is met:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">As I have said, it is the duty of this Court to come to a decision whether those circumstances amount to any evidence that a reasonable jury acting judicially could find a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‚Äëcontrol (s. 215(2)), and I am strongly of the view, with great respect to the opinion expressed by Martin J.A., that no jury acting judicially could come to such a conclusion. It must be remembered that <u>on the evidence</u> the respondent was, throughout the disgraceful incidents of the evening, a bad‚Äëtempered aggressor and that he seized on the slightest confrontation by Tremblay to again become the aggressor. If, during the fight which followed, and which I am of the opinion was a fight between two men fully consenting to the battle, he suffered a couple of kicks of indefinite violence, the provocation resulting therefrom could not possibly have caused a police officer to draw his gun and fire five shots at his assailant. To put it very shortly, I agree with the view of the learned counsel for the respondent at trial who, <u>upon the basis of this evidence</u>, decided that there was simply nothing on provocation which he could present to a jury and who, therefore, depended on the one available defence of drunkenness. There was much to be said in favour of that defence but very evidently the jury rejected it and that, of course, is not the subject of any review in this Court. [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It is impossible to read the above-quoted paragraph as limiting a judge to the examination of whether or not there is ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù in a general sense. Clearly there was some evidence for the trial judge to consider. The question was whether that evidence, taken in its context, reasonably permitted the inference necessary to support the case.</p>

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">What is the standard which the judge must apply in considering this question? Ordinarily, when there is any evidence of a matter of fact, the proof of which may be relevant to the guilt or innocence of an accused, the trial judge must leave that evidence to the jury so that they may reach their own conclusion upon it. Where, however, the trial judge is asked to put a specific defence to the jury, he is not concerned only with the existence or non‚Äëexistence of evidence of fact. <u>He must consider</u>, assuming that the evidence relied upon by the accused to support a defence is true, <u>whether that evidence is sufficient to justify the putting of the defence</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It is argued that whereas the traditional rule required only that a judge ascertain whether there was some evidence (or, put negatively, no evidence), the new rule imposed the additional requirement that the trial judge consider whether this evidence, if true, would be sufficient to warrant an acquittal.</p>

Indeed, the words ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù and ‚Äúsufficiency‚Äù have often been used, appropriately, to describe the evidential threshold. See for example <i>Perka v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Evidently, the above-quoted sentence cannot be understood as saying that the presence of ‚Äúsome evidence‚Äù will in itself give an air of reality to a defence.

Dickson J. then went on to state how that determination ought to be made:</p>

But for the most part, that criticism was directed at the corroboration requirement that had been introduced in that case. In our view, the corroboration requirement was never thought to be a core principle of the air of reality test itself. Rather, the corroboration requirement was initially seen as the <u>practical consequence</u> of applying the traditional air of reality principles to the defence of mistaken but honest belief in consent to sex.&nbsp; Subsequent cases of this Court on air of reality have made it clear that there is no corroboration requirement.

Therefore, criticism of <i>Pappajohn</i> that objected to the corroboration requirement, or that objected to the air of reality test on the basis of the corroboration requirement, must be regarded as having lost its relevance to the assessment of the air of reality test.</p>

Courts must filter out irrelevant or specious defences, since their primary effect would not be to advance the quest for truth in the trial, but rather to confuse finders of fact and divert their attention from factual determinations that are pertinent to the issue of innocence or guilt.</p>

It is in keeping with the solemnity of the jury‚Äôs task that frivolous questions are not put to it.

At bottom, this is not really an argument for a particular evidential standard, but an argument against having an air of reality test in the first place.

The question is whether there is evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit if it accepted it as true. We have seen that this question requires the trial judge to consider whether the inferences required to be established for the defence to succeed can reasonably be supported by the evidence. Where evidence does not permit a reasonable inference raising a reasonable doubt on the basis of the defence, the defence must be kept from the jury. This duty of the trial judge is at the very heart of the air of reality analysis.</p>

(circumstantial evidence is "any item of evidence, testimonial or real, other than the testimony of an eyewitness to a material fact. It is any fact from the existence of which the trier of fact may infer the existence of a fact in issue‚Äù); . . . (‚Äú[c]ircumstantial evidence . . . may be testimonial, but even if the circumstances depicted are accepted as true, additional reasoning is required to reach the desired conclusion‚Äù).&nbsp; <u>The judge must therefore weigh the evidence, in the sense of assessing whether it is reasonably capable of supporting the inferences that the [accused would ask] the jury to draw.&nbsp; This weighing, however, is limited.&nbsp; The judge does not ask whether she herself would conclude that the </u><u><span style="font-family:Shruti">accused is guilty. </span></u><u><span lang="EN-GB">Nor does the judge draw factual inferences or assess credibility.

Reasoning that Mike and Ice would be less likely to carry out their murderous plan in public view, the accused&nbsp; pulled into the well-lit parking lot of a service station. He then set about replenishing the van‚Äôs supply of windshield washer fluid. He got out of the van, in which Ice and Mike continued to sit. He entered the service station. There, he had an exchange with the cashier, and realized that he did not have enough money to pay for the fluid.&nbsp; He exited&nbsp; the service station, and returned to the van, in which Mike and Ice still waited. He borrowed money from Ice. He then re-entered the service station, and bought the washer fluid. He exited the service station again. He regained the van, popped open the hood, and replenished the supply of fluid. When he was done, he put down the container, walked to the back door of the van, opened the door, and shot Mike in the head.</p>

Nor is it enough for an accused to provide an explanation setting out just why he believed what he did was necessary. The accused must be able to point to a <u>reasonable ground</u> for that belief. The requirement is not just that the accused be able to articulate a reason for holding the belief, or point to some considerations that tended, in his mind, to support that belief.

In this case, there is absolutely no evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer the reasonableness of a belief in the absence of alternatives.

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1935] A.C. 462, the House of Lords reiterated the centrality of the presumption of innocence in English criminal law, and ruled that an accused never has any burden to prove his innocence.&nbsp; Therefore, any defence raised by the accused does not have to be demonstrated by him, but only has to raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; It is for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence is not made out.&nbsp; To hold otherwise, according to Viscount Sankey L.C., at p. 480, would amount to allowing judges to decide alone&nbsp; the case, if they concluded, at the end of the Crown‚Äôs case, that the onus had shifted to the accused and that the accused had not presented any evidence.&nbsp; In 1941, the House of Lords clarified, in <i>Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1942] A.C. 1, that this principle was not intended to mean that every possible defence must always be put to the jury in every case.&nbsp; Viscount Simon L.C. stated, at p. 8:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The House of Lords held in <i>Mancini</i> that it was not necessary to deal with the defence of provocation, in addition to the self-defence argued by the accused, since there was no evidence ‚Äúwhich might, if believed, be regarded as amounting to sufficient provocation‚Äù (p. 9).&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>Holmes v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1946] A.C. 588, the House of Lords held that even where provocation was argued, the trial judge had to instruct the jury that a verdict of manslaughter was not possible on the evidence, because there was no evidence which could support the view that the provocation was available in law.</p>

Williams, <i>Textbook of Criminal Law</i> (2nd ed. 1983), at pp. 52-59, as the accused‚Äôs evidential burden.&nbsp; At p. 53, Professor Williams indicated that imposing an evidential burden on the defendant who wishes to raise a specific defence was designed to simplify the task of the jury and most importantly, to ‚Äúprevent the defendant submitting no case if the prosecution have led no evidence on that issue‚Äù.&nbsp; Indeed, without an evidential burden on the accused, the Crown would have to ‚Äúdisprove, in the initial presentation of its case, the existence of every conceivable defence or extraneous factor that might affect a finding of guilt‚Äù (I. Weiser, ‚ÄúThe Presumption of Innocence in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">Section 11(d)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and Persuasive and Evidential Burdens‚Äù (1988-89), 31 <i>Crim.

24.4pt">It must, however, be understood that maintaining the rule that the onus always remains on the prosecution does not mean that the Crown must give evidence-in-chief to rebut a suggestion of self-defence before that issue is raised, or indeed need give any evidence on the subject at all.&nbsp; If an issue relating to self-defence is to be left to the jury there must be some evidence from which a jury would be entitled to find that issue in favour of the accused, and ordinarily no doubt such evidence would be given by the defence.&nbsp; But there is a difference between leading evidence which would enable a jury to find an issue in favour of a defendant and in putting the onus upon him.</p>

The King</i>, [1934] S.C.R. 609, at p. 616, that an accused is entitled to rely on any defence ‚Äúfor which a foundation of fact appears in the record‚Äù.&nbsp; In that case, it was held that the alternative defence of self-defence was not available where the defence of alibi negatived the possibility of self-defence.&nbsp; In&nbsp; <i>Latour v. The King</i>, [1951] S.C.R. 19, at p. 24, this Court also recognized the ‚Äúnecessity there may be for an accused in the course of the enqu√™te to introduce evidence in order to explain away the case being made by the Crown‚Äù.&nbsp; This was referred to as the ‚Äúminor burden‚Äù and contrasted with the burden of proof, properly speaking, which must always remain with the Crown (p. 25).&nbsp; The accused‚Äôs evidential burden was also explained in the following terms in <i>R. v. Proudlock</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525, at p. 549:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The accused does not have to ‚Äúestablish‚Äù a defence or an excuse, all he has to do is to raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; If there is nothing in the evidence adduced by the Crown from which a reasonable doubt can arise, then the accused will necessarily have the burden of adducing evidence if he is to escape conviction.&nbsp; However, he will not have the burden of proving his innocence, it will be sufficient if, at the conclusion of the case on both sides, the trier of fact has a reasonable doubt.</p>

Tripodi</i>, [1955] S.C.R. 438, was one of the first instances in which this Court applied the evidential burden requirement in a way similar to the modern ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù test.&nbsp; The Court held that the question of whether there was any evidence going to the requirements of the defence of provocation was a question of law.&nbsp; In that case, even assuming the accused‚Äôs testimony to be true, it was held that since the accused had admitted that he knew of his wife‚Äôs infidelity, her confession to him, which was alleged to constitute provocation, did not give rise to the defence, since the provocation could not, in law, be said to be sudden.&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>R. v. C√¥t√©</i>, [1964] S.C.R. 358, this Court found that there was no evidence in the record capable of supporting the submission that the accused was sufficiently intoxicated to be able to raise the defence of drunkenness, since there was no evidence respecting the effect on the accused of the alcohol allegedly consumed.&nbsp; The same principle was applied to self-defence by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in <i>R. v. Nelson</i>, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 179, where it was held, at p. 182, that while the trial judge must not weigh the evidence, only defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record have to be put to the jury.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 449, Fauteux C.J., for the majority, restated and clarified the applicable law, in the context of the defence of provocation, and explained it in terms of the respective functions of the trial judge and of the jury.&nbsp; He emphasized the ‚Äúprinciple according to which the sufficiency of&nbsp; evidence, which is an issue only where there is some evidence, is a question of fact for the jury and the absence of evidence is a question of law for the trial judge‚Äù (p. 454).&nbsp; Therefore, the question which the Court had to answer was whether there was some evidence of a wrongful act or insult within the meaning of the provocation defence, and it was found that there was no such evidence in that case.&nbsp; This principle, focussing on the lack of evidence, as opposed to its sufficiency, was then applied consistently by this Court and by courts of appeal in a number of subsequent cases, without reference to the ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù language (see, for example, <i>Morgentaler v. The Queen</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616; <i>R. v. Squire</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13; <i>Alward v. The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 559; <i>Linney v. The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 646; <i>Mazza v.

The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29; <i>Squire</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; In other cases, the trial judge had recognized his duty to put to the jury a defence not advanced by the accused; it was&nbsp; then argued on appeal that this defence should not have been put to the jury (see <i>Olbey</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp;</p>

J. Braithwaite, ‚ÄúDevelopments in Criminal Law and Procedure: The 1979-80 Term‚Äù (1981), 2 <i>Supreme Court L.R.</i> 177, at p. 230, explained:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
15.45pt;line-height:24.4pt">It is trite law that a trial judge is under an obligation to charge the jury in relation to every defence which arises on the evidence, even if the accused has not raised the defence.&nbsp; So, for example, in <i>Olbey</i>, where the accused argued the defence of self-defence, the trial judge on his own initiative raised the defence of provocation.&nbsp; Such developments should not be regarded as unusual, <u>for some defences are more appropriately suggested by the court; in a case like <i>Olbey</i> the accused‚Äôs raising the defence of provocation rather than relying upon the trial judge, as Lord Salmon explains in <i>D.P.P. v. Walker</i>, [[1974] 1 W.L.R. 1090 (P.C.),] ‚Äúmight prejudice the accused by offering the jury an option of returning a verdict of manslaughter, which could result in the accused being sentenced to a long term of imprisonment instead of being acquitted as he would be, should self-defence be accepted by the jury‚Äù.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

<div class="Section77">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The possibility of a defence leading to a less favourable result for the accused should not prevent a judge from instructing the jury on that defence if it clearly arose on the evidence.&nbsp; However, in borderline cases, the fact that experienced counsel for the accused made a tactical decision at trial not to raise a defence may be taken into account by a court of appeal that is subsequently asked to rule that the trial judge was in error in not putting the alternative defence to the jury.&nbsp; For example, in <i>Leary</i>, <i>supra</i>, Pigeon J., for the majority, said, at p. 60, that even if there had been some slight evidence to support the defence of drunkenness, which in any case was not available for the crime of rape as it was a crime of general intent, the fact that counsel chose not to raise a weak alternative defence that contradicted the main defence, so as to not prejudice the accused‚Äôs position, was a relevant factor.&nbsp; Where, as in the present case, the inquiry concerns the only defence raised and relied upon by the accused at trial, those concerns are not present, and the analysis must be envisaged from a different perspective.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Where, however, the trial judge is asked to put a specific defence to the jury, he is not concerned only with the existence or non-existence of evidence of fact.&nbsp; He must consider, assuming that the evidence relied upon by the accused to support a defence is true, whether that evidence is <u>sufficient</u> to justify the putting of the defence.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This seemed to constitute a departure from the previous authorities, especially from the statement in <i>Parnerkar</i>, <i>supra</i>, quoted above, according to which the sufficiency of the evidence was a matter for the jury while only the absence of evidence was a matter for the judge.&nbsp; It is in that context that the phrase ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù, which has now become a term of art, was first used by this Court.&nbsp; McIntyre J., at p. 127, was quoting from the previous case of <i>Kelsey v. The Queen</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220, where the term ‚Äúsense of reality‚Äù had been used.&nbsp; In <i>Kelsey</i>, the term was used not to assess the availability of a defence, but rather the validity of a defence argument to the effect that the trial judge should have mentioned in his charge some of the evidence which was said to contradict the veracity of the accused‚Äôs confession.&nbsp; It was in that context that Fauteux J., as he then was, for the majority, had said, at p. 226 (also quoted in <i>Pappajohn</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 127):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The term ‚Äúsense of reality‚Äù had also been used, as pointed out by McIntyre J., at p.&nbsp;127, in <i>Pappajohn</i>, in <i>Workman v. The Queen</i>, [1963] S.C.R. 266, where it was argued, on appeal, that the judge should have instructed the jury on the ‚Äúdefence‚Äù that one of the co-accused was only involved in the murder as an accessory after the fact.&nbsp; This possibility was found not to arise on the evidence.&nbsp;</p>

Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, that evidence respecting the complainant‚Äôs prior sexual behaviour should not be admissible for the purpose of either attacking her credibility as a witness, or inviting the jury to draw the inference that the complainant was more likely to have consented in the circumstances at issue, on the assumption that, as a&nbsp; sexually active woman, she would be prone to consent to sexual relations on any occasion.&nbsp; The defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent has often attempted to root itself in similar misconceptions, for example where an accused bases his alleged belief in consent only on his prior belief that the complainant certainly would consent to sexual relations with him (see <i>Park</i> (1995), <i>supra</i>, at paras. 24 and 52-53), or on the complainant‚Äôs passivity or lack of resistance (see <i>Ewanchuk</i>, <i>supra</i>) or, worse, on his conception that ‚Äúno means yes‚Äù, or that the complainant is in fact consenting in her own mind even though she is expressing lack of consent.&nbsp; Neither prosecutions nor defences can properly rest on facts founded exclusively on such unacceptable myths and stereotypes.&nbsp;</p>

Roach, <i>Criminal Law</i> (2nd ed. 2000), at p. 247:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
15.45pt;line-height:24.4pt">The judge does not, however, have to instruct the jury about every defence in every case.&nbsp; The accused has to overcome a threshold evidential burden by pointing to some evidence that justifies consideration of the particular defence.&nbsp; In other words, the accused has to establish that there is an air of reality that justifies instructing the jury about the defence.&nbsp; <u>This requires some evidence as to the existence of all the elements of the defence including both their objective and subjective components.&nbsp; The sufficiency of the evidence is then left to the jury.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Thus, the ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù language is now being generally used in describing the evidential burden on the accused to raise any defence.&nbsp; Since the elaboration of the modern test, the principle has in fact been applied to determine the availability of the defences of provocation (see <i>R. v. Malott</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 499 (Ont. C.A.), aff‚Äôd on different grounds, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 123; <i>R. v. Stewart</i> (1995), 41 C.R. (4th) 102 (B.C.C.A.)), self-defence (see <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Accordingly, Dickson J. stated, at p. 251, that the defence of necessity ‚Äúwas restricted to instances of non-compliance ‚Äòin urgent situations of clear and imminent peril when compliance with the law is demonstrably impossible‚Äô‚Äù.&nbsp; The boundaries of the defence of necessity were further complemented by a policy analysis of proportionality, described as follows, at p. 252:</p>

Similarly, in <i>Faid</i>, <i>supra</i>, a case which involved alternative defences and therefore also raised different concerns, it was found, at p. 278, that while there was evidence of an act that the jury could possibly find amounted to provocation, there was absolutely no evidence, in the accused‚Äôs testimony or from any other source, that the accused in fact lost control, had his ‚Äúpassions . . . inflamed‚Äù or ‚Äúkilled in [the] heat of blood‚Äù.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Where the ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù test is applied to a single defence situation, it seems clear that the only possible way to avoid a substantive assessment of the merits of the defence is to limit the application of the test to cases like the ones referred to above, where there truly is a complete lack of evidence going to an essential requirement of the defence.&nbsp; The application of the test where there is evidence which, in the opinion of the court, is not strong enough to raise a reasonable doubt, should be avoided.&nbsp; This is especially true where, as in this case, it is the opinion of the Court of Appeal or of this Court which is sought, as opposed to that of the trial judge.&nbsp; In <i>Thibert</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 33, Cory J. indicated:&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The rationale behind such a strict test is readily understood when one considers the fundamental importance of the jury system in our law.&nbsp; In <i>Charemski</i>, <i>supra</i>, Bastarache J., elaborated on this rationale, in the context of the application of the ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù test to cases involving circumstantial evidence only.&nbsp; He stated, at para. 13:</p>

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">The problem which arises here has its roots in the tendency to overlook the division of duties inherent in a trial by judge and jury.&nbsp; No authority need be cited for the proposition that in a jury trial all questions of law are for the judge alone and, of equal importance, all questions of fact are for the jury alone.&nbsp; The distinction is of fundamental importance.&nbsp; It should be preserved so long as it is considered right to continue the use of the jury in the criminal law.&nbsp; Much of the difficulty that has arisen on this subject has been caused by a failure to recognize and preserve this distinction.</p>

Paccar of Canada Ltd.</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 983; <i>Lester (W.W.) (1978) Ltd. v. United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry, Local 740</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 644; <i>Pointe-Claire (City) v.

P√©tel</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 12, are the existence of an unlawful assault, a reasonable apprehension of a risk of death or grievous bodily harm, and a reasonable belief that it is not possible to preserve oneself from harm except by killing the adversary.&nbsp; As <i>P√©tel</i> also makes clear, at p. 13, an accused may make an honest but reasonable mistake as to each of those three requirements, including the existence of an assault, and still succeed in his defence.&nbsp; Evidence relevant to the existence of each of these requirements is necessary for the defence to possess the requisite ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù.&nbsp; As for the reasonableness requirement, the ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù analysis must not invite an assessment of the reasonableness of the accused‚Äôs perceptions, but rather a determination of whether there is any evidence of an explanation as to why the accused perceived things the way he did, so that the jury can decide whether the accused‚Äôs perceptions and actions were reasonable in the circumstances.</p>

Furthermore, the respondent testified that he believed that the victim and Ice were attempting to kill him, in that they had ‚Äúset a trap‚Äù for him in order to be able to kill him as soon as there was an opportunity.&nbsp; He said that he interpreted the victim‚Äôs and Ice‚Äôs actions as being part of an attempt to kill him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Charlebois</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 674, 2000 SCC 53, at para. 16, to a requirement of imminency to be other than an application of reasonableness to the facts of that case.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">237<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>Reasonableness can hardly be established by a single item of evidence; rather, it calls for an appreciation of all the circumstances, including the credibility of the witnesses who relate the events.&nbsp; Despite its objective component reasonableness remains a question for the jury.&nbsp; In the present case, the accused‚Äôs testimony detailed the circumstances surrounding the offence, as well as the broader context in which his perceptions arose.&nbsp; The evidence required to give a defence an ‚Äúair of reality‚Äù may come from the accused‚Äôs testimony alone, and need not be confirmed by independent evidence.&nbsp; Therefore, it will be for the jury to assess whether, in the context described by the accused of having two men in his van that he believed to be armed and intent on killing him that very night, it was reasonable for him not to consider running away or calling the police.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:24.4pt">238<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>I must add that the accused did not forfeit his right to rely on self-defence merely because he entered his van with the victim and Ice without being coerced to do so, while he suspected, but was not yet certain, that they wanted to kill him.&nbsp; What is relevant for the purposes of the law of self-defence is the reasonableness of the accused‚Äôs actions and perceptions at the time of the offence.&nbsp; The background circumstances and the prior actions of the accused will of course be relevant to this assessment, but the jury is not asked to pass judgment on the reasonableness of the accused‚Äôs past actions, or of his whole lifestyle.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">239<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>In <i>Lavallee</i>, <i>supra</i>, referring to the fact that the accused had not left her partner before in spite of the intolerable violence that she was subjected to, Wilson J. indicated, at p. 884, that ‚Äú[t]his question does not really go to whether she had an alternative to killing the deceased at the critical moment‚Äù.&nbsp; While this evidence was of course relevant to provide the background circumstances necessary to assess the reasonableness of the accused‚Äôs belief that she had no alternative at the time of the offence, the jury was not to assess whether it was reasonable for the accused not to leave her partner at a previous time.&nbsp; Wilson J. further explained, at p. 888:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:82.95pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
13.7pt;line-height:24.4pt">I emphasize at this juncture that <u>it is not for the jury to pass judgment on the fact that an accused battered woman stayed in the relationship.&nbsp; Still less is it entitled to conclude that she forfeited her right to self-defence for having done so.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:63.0pt;
line-height:24.4pt">240<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>The respondent is not asking this Court to take into account, in deciding whether there is any evidence relevant to the reasonableness of his perceptions and actions, a criminal ‚Äúworld-view‚Äù, or a specific set of values that would advocate, for example, choosing to fight instead of running away in order to preserve one‚Äôs honour.&nbsp; Such values would certainly not be controlling.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Hibbert</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, at paras. 59-60, Lamer C.J., for the Court, indicated that the standard to be used to assess the reasonableness of the accused‚Äôs belief in the lack of alternative should be similar for the defences of necessity, duress and self-defence.&nbsp; In <i>Ruzic</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 61, LeBel J. described the standard as follows, in the context of the defence of duress:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The test requires that the situation be examined from the point of view of a reasonable person, but similarly situated.&nbsp; The courts will take into consideration the particular circumstances where the accused found himself and his ability to perceive a reasonable alternative to committing a crime, with an awareness of his background and essential characteristics.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">241<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the respondent‚Äôs background in this case, as well as the circumstances surrounding the offence, involve criminal activity, does not mean that it cannot be taken into account by the jury.&nbsp; On the contrary, the assessment remains similar, regardless of the type of circumstances involved.&nbsp; In all cases, the jury must take into account the accused‚Äôs circumstances and background to the extent that they shed light on and explain his perception of the existence of an assault, his apprehension of death and his belief in the lack of alternative.&nbsp; Reprobation for the accused‚Äôs lifestyle or past actions is properly expressed in a prosecution for any crime that he might have committed&nbsp; in the past, but it should not be expressed by an effective denial of the defence of self-defence through the refusal to take into account circumstances that are related to a criminal background.</p>

line-height:24.4pt">242<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp; </span>The test for committal for trial, directed verdicts of acquittal and the withdrawing of a defence from the jury strives to respect the long-standing divisions of tasks between judges and jury, and favours great deference to the wisdom of the jury.&nbsp; Discharges at the preliminary inquiry and directed verdicts of acquittal also promote judicial economy and may serve as an early barrier to the danger of a wrongful conviction.&nbsp; Not so where a defence is withdrawn from the jury.&nbsp; The only rational purpose served by withdrawing a defence is to avoid confusing the jury who may then wrongly acquit on the basis of that confusion.&nbsp; When the critical issue in a criminal case is whether a person who otherwise committed a crime acted reasonably in the circumstances, we ought not to misconstrue the risk of the jury being confused with the possibility that we may disagree with its verdict.</p>
