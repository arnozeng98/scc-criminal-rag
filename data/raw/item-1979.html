24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> McLachlin&nbsp;C.J. and Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Binnie, Arbour and LeBel&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; The trial judge‚Äôs directions to the jury on identification evidence were not so deficient as to constitute an error of law.&nbsp; In the circumstances of this case, however, the trial judge should have cautioned the jury more strongly that the identification of the accused in court was highly problematic as direct reliable identification of the perpetrator of the offence.&nbsp; It is important to remember that the danger associated with eyewitness in‚Äëcourt identification is that it is deceptively credible, largely because it is honest and sincere.&nbsp; The dramatic impact of the identification taking place in court, before the jury, can aggravate the distorted value that the jury may place on it.&nbsp; The instruction to the effect that such identification should be accorded ‚Äúlittle weight‚Äù does not go far enough to displace the danger that the jury could still give it weight that it does not deserve.&nbsp; In this particular case, it would have been prudent to emphasize for the benefit of the jury the very weak link between the confidence level of a witness and the accuracy of that witness.&nbsp; Moreover, it should also have been stressed that the impact of the victim having seen the accused arrested by the police as her alleged assailant could not be undone.&nbsp; Nor could she be expected to divorce her previous recollection of her assailant from the mental image that she formed after having seen the accused on television.</span></p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Crown properly conceded that the trial judge‚Äôs instructions on alibi were in error in the absence of evidence that the accused was implicated in putting forward a fabricated alibi.&nbsp; The law with respect to the rejection of a defence of alibi may be summarized as follows.&nbsp; In the absence of evidence of concoction (deliberate fabrication) an alibi that is disbelieved has no evidentiary value.&nbsp; A disbelieved alibi is insufficient to support an inference of concoction or deliberate fabrication.&nbsp; There must be other evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the alibi was deliberately fabricated and that the accused was involved in that attempt to mislead the jury.&nbsp; It is the attempt to deceive, and not the failed alibi, that supports an inference of consciousness of guilt.&nbsp; In appropriate cases, for instance if there were multiple accused, the jury should be instructed that the fabricated alibi may be used to place the accused at the scene of the crime, but may fall short of directly implicating him in its commission.&nbsp; When there is evidence that an alibi was fabricated, at the instigation or with the knowledge and approval of the accused, that evidence may be used by the jury to support an inference of consciousness of guilt.&nbsp; In cases where such an inference is available, the jury should be instructed that it may, not must, be drawn.&nbsp; A fabricated alibi is not conclusive evidence of guilt.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The curative proviso cannot be used to overcome the erroneous instructions on the defence of alibi in this case.&nbsp; The error was not a trivial error nor one that would be unlikely to have had any effect on the verdict.&nbsp; The trial judge‚Äôs erroneous instructions implied that the jury could find evidence of concoction allowing them to infer that the accused was guilty.&nbsp; This is a serious error that provided the jury with a direct route to guilt.&nbsp; Despite the circumstantial evidence that points to the accused, it cannot be confidently said that a conviction is a foregone conclusion in the sense that any other reasonable jury would inevitably convict.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; The trial judge‚Äôs directions to the jury on identification evidence did not constitute an error of law.&nbsp; Moreover, her warning in this regard was adequate.&nbsp; The trial judge‚Äôs direction to the jury pointed out the general and specific problems with the identification evidence while at the same time respecting the role of the jury to weigh the evidence that was properly before it.&nbsp; With regard to the in‚Äëcourt identification of the accused, the trial judge clearly explained to the jury the possibility that the witnesses recognized the accused from their memory of the photographic line‚Äëup or newscast rather than from the scene of the crime.&nbsp; She instructed the jury that for this reason the in‚Äëcourt identification was entitled to little weight.&nbsp; This instruction was appropriate because it pointed out to the jury the weaknesses associated with the evidence without encroaching on the jury‚Äôs essential function as the trier of fact.&nbsp; Whether the victim was able to identify the accused as her assailant, or whether she was merely identifying him as the man she saw being arrested and at previous hearings, was ultimately a question for the jury to answer. </span></p>

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I am going to give you a special warning about the evidence of eye witnesses. As you know, it is such a major issue here, the issue of identity. Every once in a while in our courts a person is convicted of an offence even though she or he is innocent, and when this does happen it is often because a mistake has been made by one or more eye witnesses. It is easy to see how this can happen. You no doubt have had experience yourself where you think you have recognized someone and then found out that the person you thought it was is not the person you thought it was. An eye witness can be very convincing when that witness honestly believes that the accused person is the person she or he saw. Observation and memory can be unreliable when it comes to identification of people because people make honest mistakes. So when considering the evidence of the eye witnesses, it might be helpful for you, and I urge you to use the following guidelines paying particular attention to each eye witness‚Äô opportunity to observe the person being described or identified.</p>

Following this, she added an additional caution:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

In my view, the trial judge adequately provided this aspect of the required warning. Specific vulnerabilities in the identification evidence were identified by the trial judge and discussed in considerable detail. The trial judge raised the question: ‚ÄúDid the eye witness see a photograph of the person described before making the identification?‚Äù &nbsp;In answer to this she reviewed the following evidence:</p>

Ms. Visscher did as well, and she was unable to identify the accused in court as the man she saw on the dike. Both Mrs. McLeod and Mrs. Baker had seen news coverage on television of the accused leaving the courthouse after he was charged. As well you have the evidence of Janet McLeod that she watched the television newscast three times, and that in so doing the television picture of the accused was stopped. The freeze frame photo has been referred to. She said she watched the news on December 14, 1993 to make sure it is the right person. Those were her words. She and her husband froze the picture of the accused in the newscast and she looked at it and she said then and she says now that the accused is the right person.</p>

On the one hand, the jury is told that in-court identification has some purpose and in particular can be used to refute the Crown‚Äôs theory that the accused is the perpetrator if the witness is unable to identify the accused as the perpetrator in court. On the other hand, they are told that a positive in-court identification of the accused as the perpetrator should not be relied upon as direct reliable evidence of the identification of the perpetrator. In my view, a jury would find these two views confusing and inconsistent and would tend to disregard in-court identification for any purpose. The approach of the trial judge in this case was preferable. Rather than instructing the jury to disregard the identification of the accused in court, she warned the jury that this evidence was entitled to little weight and accompanied this warning with a clear explanation as to why the evidence was entitled to little weight given the particular circumstances of the case.</p>

Once the decision has been made to allow evidence to be put before the jury, it is ultimately up to the jury to determine what weight to attribute to that evidence. Though this Court recognizes that there are certain frailties associated with identification evidence that must be brought to the attention of the jury, properly admitted identification evidence should not be effectively removed from the jury‚Äôs consideration by means of the trial judge‚Äôs instruction.&nbsp; As was stated by Weiler J.A. in <i>R. v.

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The trial judge was correct that the generally accepted state of the law is that, where evidence is tainted, either because identification was suggested by the accused‚Äôs presence in the prisoner‚Äôs box or as a result of inappropriate police procedures, the evidence is not thereby rendered inadmissible. Rather, the evidence of tainting is <u>a factor going to the weight of the evidence which is exclusively the province of the jury</u>. See <i>R. v. Mezzo</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802; 68 N.R. 1; 43 Man.

While in some cases it may be appropriate for the trial judge to instruct the jury to accord "little weight" to the in-court identification, in other cases the trial judge must instruct the jury that in-court identification should not be used as evidence of "direct reliable identification"<span lang="EN-GB">, a standard which presumably lies somewhere in between ‚Äúlittle weight‚Äù and ‚Äúno weight‚Äù.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">As I have noted, there has been a reluctance on the part of this and other appellate courts to adopt a general rule such as that found in the <i>Turnbull</i> case. The reason for that is undoubtedly the fear that in some cases a special instruction on the inherent frailties of eyewitness identification will induce juries to reject accurate identifications and acquit where they should convict.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">But that concern can be met by casting the special instruction in language appropriate to the case. <u>The precise point which has been made time and again is that there is no rigid formulation for such instruction.</u> Each should be designed with specific reference to the evidence which either supports or casts doubt on the eyewitness identification. . . .</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

My colleague suggests that the trial judge should have emphasized ‚Äúthe very weak link between the confidence level of a witness and the accuracy of that witness‚Äù. In my view, the trial judge communicated that idea to the jury when she explained that an eyewitness can be very convincing when he or she honestly believes that the accused person is the person she or he saw, but that ‚Äú[o]bservation and memory can be unreliable when it comes to identification of people because people make honest mistakes.‚Äù</p>

However, in my view, it is the latter two factors that are dispositive of this case. The trial judge mitigated the seriousness of the error contained in the then standard jury instructions by tailoring the instruction to the particular circumstances of the case. When the error in the trial judge‚Äôs instructions on alibi is considered in the context of the charge as a whole and against the background of the entire trial, it is evident that there was no reasonable possibility that the error would have impacted upon the reasoning process of the jury.</p>

Where the error is determined to be ‚Äúserious‚Äù, the proviso should not be applied unless the evidence of guilt untainted by the error is so overwhelming that any other reasonable jury would inevitably convict (<i>Khan</i>, <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; at para. 26). My colleague suggests that the error made in this case was, by its very nature, serious. In my view, there is no independent yardstick by which to gauge the seriousness of the error. As McIntyre J. remarked in <i>Mahoney v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, at p. 852, ‚Äú[t]he Court of Appeal must consider the errors against the background of the whole trial.‚Äù Whether an error is considered ‚Äútrivial‚Äù or whether it is ‚Äúserious‚Äù depends on the extent to which it can be said to have affected the jury‚Äôs determination.</p>

The trial judge‚Äôs error consisted of giving the standard instruction concerning false alibi as contained in G. A. Ferguson and J. C. Bouck, <i>Canadian Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), vol. 2, at pp. 8.04-1 to 8.04-4. Those instructions were found to be in error in <i>R. v. Tessier</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 538 (B.C.C.A.), a decision which the trial judge did not have the benefit of when charging the jury. <i>Tessier </i>holds that in the absence of some evidence of actual concoction, a disbelieved alibi has no evidentiary value and cannot be placed on the scales to contribute to a finding of guilt. It is therefore an error to instruct the jury that they can draw an inference of guilt from a disbelieved alibi in the absence of independent evidence of fabrication. The error is described in the following terms in <i>R. v. Krishantharajah </i>(1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 157 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 163-64:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">This court has consistently held that in the absence of evidence of concoction, (there is no suggestion by the Crown that such exists in this case), an alibi that is disbelieved has no evidentiary value. It should not be added to other evidence to contribute to a finding of guilt. . . . As explained by Doherty J.A. in <i>Coutts</i>, this cannot be justified by pure logic because in many cases the inference of concoction, and thus consciousness of guilt, may flow naturally from disbelief. However, the safeguard is necessary to prevent the jury from short-circuiting the Crown‚Äôs obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by moving directly from disbelief of an alibi to a finding of guilt.</p>

In addition, the jury would have had to have applied the inference to go directly to a finding of guilt without examining the whole of the evidence.

Keep in mind that a person may tell an untrue story for reasons other than for trying to hide guilt, <u>that the Crown here is not suggesting to you that the times as they relate to the defence of alibi are concocted</u>. Rather the Crown is suggesting that the times testified to have been reconstructed through conversations among and between the accused, Mrs. Hibbert and the daughters. <u>The Crown is therefore arguing the weight and encouraging you not to give it much weight</u>, that is the evidence of specific times as testified to by the accused and family members.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, the jury would likely take these comprehensive instructions as their guide to assessing the alibi evidence as opposed to drawing an inference of guilt based on a theory of concoction that was, as the trial judge carefully reminded, not before them.</p>

In my view, the fact that the jury deliberated for several days indicates that they did not proceed on the erroneous basis that they could move directly from a rejection of the accused‚Äôs alibi to guilt. Perhaps more significant is that after three days of deliberations the jury asked the trial judge to read back the charge on circumstantial evidence. The jury‚Äôs request to have the direction on circumstantial evidence repeated suggests that the jury, having rejected the defence of alibi, went on to determine whether the accused was guilty on the basis of the circumstantial evidence adduced by the Crown. Had the jury found the alibi to be concocted and followed the erroneous instruction that they could infer guilt on this basis alone, they would have required no further clarification on the distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence.</p>

The test for the application of the proviso is not whether it is in theory possible that the verdict would have been different had the error not been made, but rather whether there is a reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different taking into account the background of the whole trial. As the Ontario Court of Appeal once observed, ‚Äú[t]here will probably never be a perfect charge or one that cloistered appellate counsel cannot find objectionable after minute scrutiny‚Äù (<i>R. v. Demeter </i>(1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 417, at p. 436). Though the test for the application of the proviso is strict, it nonetheless recognizes that while the accused is entitled to a properly instructed jury he or she is not entitled to a perfectly instructed one (<i>Jacquard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 2).</p>

Hibbert </i>(1996), 78 B.C.A.C. 277).&nbsp; In my view, applying the proviso in the circumstances of this trial even though it was not applied in the first trial creates no inconsistency. In the first trial the Court of Appeal commented at length upon the seriousness of the trial judge‚Äôs failure to give an adequate warning on identification evidence at para. 63:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The case for the Crown against the appellant was indeed a strong circumstantial case and the address of counsel for the appellant at trial had stressed the weakness of the identification evidence shortly before the judge gave his charge. However, in my view, it was important that the judge deal with the weaknesses in the identification evidence and avoid giving the jury the impression that Mrs. McLeod and Mrs. Baker had identified the appellant as the man who committed the assault. This was particularly important in the case under appeal because the appellant had testified, supported by his wife and two stepdaughters, that he was not the person who had entered the house and assaulted Mrs. McLeod. There was the possibility that Mrs. McLeod was confused in her evidence over when she had learned of the military background of the appellant. Further, there was no evidence that the appellant had any motive for committing the assault on Mrs. McLeod. The appellant‚Äôs credibility and the credibility of Mrs. Hibbert and the two daughters were significant matters for the jury to consider and weigh with the weaknesses in the evidence of identification in deciding whether it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the person who committed the crime. <u>If the learned judge had warned the jury of the weaknesses in the identification evidence, the jury might have been left with a reasonable doubt that the Crown had proved that it was the appellant who committed the assault.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

In my view, there is a compelling rationale underlying the rule that when applying the proviso, the court looks to the error and whether that error might have affected the jury. If the court were to look only to the case as a whole and whether it was overwhelming for any jury, the result would be that trials would be held over and over again as long as the trial judge‚Äôs charge contained some error, no matter how minute.</p>

This conclusion is nonetheless inextricably linked to a finding that the weight of the Crown‚Äôs evidence was overwhelming and I do not reject the Court of Appeal‚Äôs conclusion in this regard. Having determined that there was no real possibility that the error in question affected the reasoning process of the jury, it is only logical to conclude that the accused was convicted because the evidence against him was overwhelming.</p>
