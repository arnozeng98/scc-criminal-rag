Following their separation in 1979 after seventeen years of marriage, the relation between the estranged spouses became increasingly bitter and acrimonious as they fought a long, hotly contested series of custody, access and matrimonial property battles. On January 21, 1983, appellant's exâwife was ferociously beaten and then shot to death. At trial, the Crown led direct and circumstantial evidence to prove that the appellant had personally murdered his exâwife or, alternatively, that he aided or abetted the killer and was therefore guilty as a party to the offence pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec21" target="_blank">s. 21<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

He explained briefly the position of the defence and spent considerable time summarizing the Crown's evidence. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder contrary to s. 218 of the <i>Code</i>. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.</span></p>

Where an accused is being tried alone and there is evidence that more than one person was involved in the commission of the offence, it is also appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of s. 21 of the <i>Code</i>, even though the identity of the other participant or participants is unknown and even though the precise part played by each participant may be uncertain. Here, there was very strong evidence connecting appellant with the crime. There was also some evidence which, if believed, indicated that he did not commit the crime personally. The facts were for the jury, and the trial judge was correct not to preclude the jury from considering all the alternatives.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

He accurately stated the law as to s. 21(1) and went through the evidence of each witness in turn. The fact that he did not carve his jury charge into discrete sections in which he reviewed the evidence consistent with appellant having personally committed the murder, appellant having committed the murder by means of s. 21(1), and, finally, appellant not having committed the murder at all, was not wrong. Much of the Crown's evidence was consistent with either Crown theory, and much of the defence evidence was consistent with either appellant's innocence or his guilt under s.&nbsp;21(1).</span></p>

Although one passage of the trial judge's charge, if it stood alone, would be wrong in law, the charge, read as a whole, made it clear that the jury was not obliged to take a binary view of the evidence (accept or reject it) but had to give effect to reasonable doubt.</span></p>

A trial judge is not required in his charge to paint in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of the evidence. Here, the gist of the appellant's complaint is that the trial judge revealed to the jurors his own perception of the accused's guilt, through undue emphasis on the Crown's evidence and inadequate summary of the defence. The defence evidence was simple and the Crown's case was complex, relying on circumstantial evidence from a large number of witnesses. It is simply inappropriate to try to measure the fairness of the charge by reference to quantity. </span></p>

It provides that either mode of committing an offence is equally culpable and, indeed, that whether a person personally commits or only aids and abets, he is guilty of that offenceââin this case, murderââand not some separate distinct offence. There is no need for the Crown to specify in the charge the nature of an accused's participation in the offence. Where there is evidence before a jury that points to an accused either committing a crime personally or, alternatively, aiding and abetting another to commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did one or the other, it is a matter of indifference which alternative actually occurred. It follows that s. 21 precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence.</span></p>

The overwhelming mass of the evidence against the appellant, however, was consistent with both theories and pointed only to his participation in the murder. The jury could not have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of one theory to the exclusion of the other, but must have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the murder, either as principal or aider and abettor. Since <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec21subsec1" target="_blank">s. 21(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> makes the distinction between participation as a principal and participation as aider and abettor legally irrelevant, it was not necessary for the jury to decide on the form of his participation and the jury was correct in convicting. But s. 21 does not always preclude a requirement of jury unanimity as to the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. Depending on the nature of the evidence presented by the Crown, the jury unanimity issue may arise in any case where the Crown alleges factually inconsistent theories, even if those theories relate to the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. If the Crown presents evidence which tends to inculpate the accused under one theory and exculpate him under the other, then the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they wish to rely on such evidence, then they must be unanimous as to the theory they adopt. Otherwise, the jury would be adding against the accused the inculpatory elements of evidence which cannot stand together because they are inconsistent.</span></p>

But there may be cases where the interrelationship between competing Crown theories and the evidence adduced in relation thereto will not justify a verdict of guilt. In each case, therefore, it will be for the trial judge, having regard to the nature of the offence, the theories of the parties, and the totality of the evidence, to realistically assess the possibility that the evidence will be used improperly, and to direct the jury accordingly. The present, however, is not such a case.</span></p>

After a fourteenâday trial before judge and jury, he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for twentyâfive years. An appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was dismissed (Vancise J.A. dissenting) (1986), 46 Sask. R. 241, 24 C.C.C. (3d) 449, [1986] 2 W.W.R. 97.

Mr. Gerald N. Allbright, counsel for Mr. Thatcher, advances a number of grounds of appeal in his factum: (i) that there existed no evidentiary basis for a direction pursuant to s. 21 of the <i>Code</i>; (ii) that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury on the application of the legal principles of parties to an offence to the evidence of the case; (iii) that the trial judge failed to summarize fairly and adequately the evidence and the theory of the defence; (iv) that the trial judge erred in directing the jury to weigh the evidence of Mr. Thatcher against the evidence of other witnesses and to choose which they accepted, thereby reducing the burden of proof; and (v) that the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal erred in ruling that the curative provision found in s. 613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Code</i> could be resorted to in the circumstances of the case. These were all grounds in respect of which there was dissent in the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, thereby giving rise to an appeal to this Court as of right, pursuant to s. 618(1)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>

It was not the subject of a dissent in the Court of Appeal and was unanimously dismissed by that Court. Leave to argue this ground was sought from this Court, and was granted. Counsel contended that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that a verdict of guilty must be unanimous in relation to one or other of the alternative means of committing the offence of murder. The effect of the argument, in the circumstances of this case, was that in order to find Mr. Thatcher guilty of murder, the jury had to be unanimous that he intentionally killed his former wife or, alternatively, that he aided or abetted another person or persons in her killing; it was simply not sufficient that some members of the jury would hold to one theory and other members would hold to the other theory. That, as I see it, is the principal issue in this appeal.</span></p>

After their marriage, they returned to Saskatchewan. They took up residence in Moose Jaw. Mr. Thatcher, the son of a oneâtime member of Parliament and Premier of Saskatchewan, developed over the years an active and successful career as rancher, farmer and politician, serving for a time as Minister of Energy and Mines in a Progressive Conservative Government of Saskatchewan. Three children, Greg, Regan and Stephanie, were born of the marriage. Thatcher admitted to infidelity during the course of the marriage. The couple separated in August 1979. JoAnn, taking the two youngest children with her, left Moose Jaw with Mr. Thatcher's best friend, Ron Graham. Relations between the estranged spouses became increasingly bitter and acrimonious as they fought a long, hotly contested series of custody, access and matrimonial property battles. Colin Thatcher became obsessed. At one juncture he spirited Regan out of the country, and was found in contempt and ordered to pay a substantial fine. JoAnn's matrimonial property entitlement was initially held to amount to $820,000 but the judgment was immediately appealed. In 1980, the Thatchers were divorced. In January 1981, JoAnn married Mr. Tony Wilson and moved into a house located across the street from the Legislative Buildings in Regina.</span></p>

This order was sought pursuant to s. 516(1)(<i>f</i>) of the <i>Code</i>. The defence also sought an order "directing disclosure by the prosecutor of all intercepted private communications to which the accused is in any way a party, or which relate in any way to the telephone or telephones of any residence or other buildings used or frequented by the accused, or which relate directly or indirectly to the charge facing the accused." The judge, dismissing the first application (reported at (1984), 42 C.R. (3d) 259), relied upon the judgment of Martin J.A. in <i>R. v. Govedarov, Popovic and Askov</i> (1974), 16 C.C.C.

Clearly, the purpose of the application for particulars was not to require the prosecution to provide the accused with additional details with respect to matters referred to in the indictment in order that the accused might be more fully informed of the act or omission charged against them but was to restrict the prosecution to reliance on a part only of the definition of murder contained in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

The car was placed so that it could command an unobstructed view of the Wilson garage. It was occupied by a single male. The motor was not running. This upset Mrs. Hasz and she informed her employer, Mr. Adams, who watched the car for fifteen minutes. As Mrs. Hasz left for home she decided to look at the license but could only read the numbers as the letters were covered with mud. She memorized the numbers 292 and repeated them as she drove home. When she arrived, she wrote them down. The occupant of the vehicle was described as a relatively young male of medium build with a beard, wearing a toque and what appeared to be rubber or surgical gloves. A police composite of the person Mrs. Hasz and Mr. Adams described did not fit Mr. Thatcher. One of the admissions of fact made on behalf of the accused was this: a 1980 Olds Delta 88 automobile bearing Saskatchewan license plate KDW 292 and owned by the Government of Saskatchewan was on January 10, 1983 checked out from the Central Vehicle Agency, Regina, to W. Colin Thatcher and remained checked out to him until it was picked up by the Regina City Police on January 27, 1983.</span></p>

The bullet was probably fired from a .38 Special or .357 Magnum Ruger revolver. The murder weapon was never found. The proprietor of a gun shop in Palm Springs, California, Ronald Williams, testified that on January 29, 1982 he sold Colin Thatcher a .357 calibre Ruger revolver. Thatcher picked up the gun along with a holster and ammunition on February 20, 1982. The ammunition consisted of two boxes of Winchester western .38 calibre Special Plus P silver tip hollow point shells and two bags of reloaded ammunition.

Anderson is a farmer from the Caron district and a rural neighbour of Colin Thatcher. He testified he had met Thatcher in the fall of 1980 and Thatcher had asked him if he was interested in killing JoAnn Wilson for a fee of $50,000 or, if not, whether he could find someone to do it for him. Anderson stated he knew another person named Charlie Wilde who might be interested. Wilde suggested a third person, Cody Crutcher, who would be willing to take on the job. Anderson stated that Thatcher gave him $15,000 to pass on to Crutcher, and that Anderson paid some $14,500 to Crutcher, together with a picture of JoAnn Wilson and a set of her car keys. Nothing came of this and Anderson then arranged for a meeting with Charlie Wilde at a farm north of Caron, Saskatchewan in the spring of 1981. At that meeting Charlie Wilde told Thatcher he would do the job himself while visiting the United States. Before doing anything, however, Charlie Wilde was arrested in Winnipeg on an unrelated matter.</span></p>

On May 16 or 17, 1981, prior to the wounding of Mrs. Wilson, Anderson, at Thatcher's request, rented a car for Thatcher and turned it over to him by dropping it off at a prearranged location. On instructions given by Thatcher, AnÂ­derson waited to hear of the wounding of JoAnn Wilson before he went back to get the car. Once he had heard she had been shot he returned to the place where he had left the car, retrieved the vehicle, cleaned it and returned it to the rental dealer. He noted that the car was dusty and that the licence plates were smeared with mud. Anderson testified that in the fall of 1982 he again met with Thatcher and asked him how he could have missed, to which the appellant answered that he did not know.</span></p>

The gun was a .357 calibre Magnum Security Special. Anderson was unsuccessful in getting a workable silencer made and on January 20, 1983 he saw Thatcher and reported that to him. At that time Thatcher told him he had been stalking his exâwife for a week and that he wanted the gun back. The gun was turned over to Thatcher on the afternoon of January 21, 1983. Earlier that morning Thatcher asked Anderson to get him a car. Anderson turned that over to Thatcher on that day on directions given him by Thatcher. Anderson then read in the newspaper that JoAnn Wilson had been killed. That was his signal to retrieve the car from where he had left it for Thatcher. He got the car back, cleaned it out, cleaned the licence plates off, and burned the items he removed from the vehicle. In cleaning out the car the witness testified that he removed clothing he had seen Thatcher wearing when Anderson turned the car over to him, plus a tuft of hair he thought came from a wig.</span></p>

Anderson later asked him if he was interested in doing a killing. At that time Wilde told Anderson he was not interested. Wilde later talked to his friend Cody Crutcher and they decided that, while they would not do the killing, they would be happy to take the money offered for it. In December 1980, Anderson, Wilde and Crutcher met in Regina. Anderson gave Crutcher $7,500 which Crutcher split with Wilde. Shortly after that Wilde again met with Anderson and got another $7,000 plus a picture of the intended victim, JoAnn Wilson, and her car keys. In March 1981, Wilde met with Anderson and Thatcher. At that time Thatcher pressed him to do the job and offered him 50 to 60 thousand dollars if he would complete the killing. He told Wilde that his exâwife, her husband, and Stephanie were going to Ames, Iowa, to visit her parents during the Easter week of 1981. He indicated that Ames would be a good place to "hit" her, gave the Iowa address to Wilde, and suggested that he, Wilde, could phone him in a few days at the Legislature, by which time he would probably have some money available. While Wilde said he had no intention of killing anyone, he agreed to do what was asked in order to see if he could get some money. At a subsequent meeting with Thatcher, Thatcher gave Wilde $4,500 to assist him in travelling to the United States where JoAnn was visiting her parents. Shortly after, Wilde was arrested in Winnipeg for breaking into a drugstore. Wilde acknowledged having a lengthy criminal record, mainly for drug offences.</span></p>

Collver invited Thatcher and several members of his family to visit over Christmas at his dude ranch near Phoenix, Arizona.

According to Collver he and Thatcher had previously talked about some horrible people two lawyer friends of Collver knew in Calgary and Edmonton. And he testified that Thatcher wanted him to phone one and get somebody to assist him in killing his wife. Collver says he told Thatcher he was suffering from an obsession and that he should get rid of it. When Thatcher renewed the request at least three more times the same day, Collver asked him to leave the ranch and he and the family departed the following morning.</span></p>

He told Thatcher he would be bled to death if he kept on with lawyers, but that if he would give him a bottom line, that he, Collver, would try to negotiate a settlement. Thatcher told him his bottom line was $400,000.00 and custody of the two boys. Collver said he met with JoAnn and she asked him if she could bring in a friend to assist her, who it turned out was Tony Wilson. The upshot of the meeting was that JoAnn would accept $230,000.00 and custody of Stephanie, with Thatcher to have custody of the two boys. Collver said he was ecstatic. He immediately telephoned Thatcher and told him what he had achieved. According to Collver Thatcher's reply was, "The bitch isn't going to get anything."

Mr. Dotson's testimony was that he discovered the body at approximately 6:00 p.m. A test conducted by the police determined that it was possible to travel from the victim's house in Regina to the appellant's residence in Moose Jaw in roughly twentyâeight minutes. Testimony indicating that Mr. Thatcher was elsewhere would, if believed, go to rebut the allegation that he personally murdered his exâwife.

He stated that he immediately called Thatcher at his home, at "about 6:15 p.m." and passed on this information. Shortly thereafter, a reporter came to his house who told him that perhaps Mrs. Wilson had been killed. He stated that he "waited a bit of time" and then called the appellant again, "shortly after seven o'clock", with that information, informed him that he was going out, and gave Thatcher a number at which he could be reached should the police arrive. Merchant then went to the Wilson residence and spoke to a police officer who confirmed that Mrs. Wilson indeed had been killed. He testified that he then telephoned Thatcher again with the news, at approximately 7:20 p.m. The next morning, he advised Thatcher that he had a legal right to take custody of his daughter Stephanie. He testified that he, Thatcher, and Thatcher's son Gregory, thereafter personally attended the Kohli home, where Stephanie was staying, and that some physical force was used to take custody of Stephanie. </span></p>

He testified that he retained the original telephone record of a call he had made to Thatcher that evening, as well as the original record of two of the three calls to Thatcher the night Mrs. Wilson was killed. He described three mysterious breakâins of his office, which resulted in the disappearance of these records, and stressed that these breakâins occurred after Thatcher had been arrested and after Mr. Merchant had disclosed the existence of the records in an affidavit supporting Thatcher's bail application. Mr. Merchant implied that they were stolen because they were otherwise protected by the solicitor and client relationship. Mr. Merchant's testimony proved to be incorrect.

My Lord, just prior to calling my next witness, I wonder, there is a matter I would like to address you as an officer of the court, and I just mentioned it briefly to my Learned Friend and I think it should be done by way, in my view as an officer of the court, as a brief submission so that the evidence is clear before the Jury and there is no misconception. I received a telephone call this morning at nine thirty from Mr. Merchant, who of course was here yesterday, who advised me that he had checked with his partners in Regina and that the breakâin occurred before, and I think this is very important, and I want to clarify it, the breakâins occurred before Mr. Thatcher was arrested and of course that certainly wasn't what he indicated to us in his crossâexamination to us yesterday. And as an officer of the court I want that raised and clarified now, My Lord. Mr. Kujawa was kind enough to agree that it would be appropriate for me to rise and address you on it at this time. Mr. Merchant advised me of that at nineâthirty this morning when I was in the barrister's lounge by telephone. I wish to bring it to your attention and the attention of the Jury.</span></p>

With respect to the earlier unsuccessful attempt on his exâwife's life, he testified that on the evening in question he was with his son Regan at home, and that they were opening up the swimming pool for the summer. As to the day his exâwife was killed, Mr. Thatcher testified that he spent the morning of January 21 at his ranch in Caron, that he went to his residence in Moose Jaw over the noon hour to do some paper work and odds and ends, and that he returned between 4:00 and 4:30 in the afternoon to his ranch. He stated that he checked his cattle for approximately half an hour and then returned home to Moose Jaw. On his way home, in Moose Jaw, Thatcher stated that he exchanged waves with Mr. Hammond. His testimony as to his subsequent whereabouts on that evening parallelled that given by Mrs. Silversides, his sons and Mr. Merchant.</span></p>

He said he met her in October, 1980 in Palm Springs, California, and that they got along well but that she "had a misconception...that there was some remote possibility that we might be getting married". He denied several aspects of her testimony. First, he denied that he went down to Palm Springs a few days after the first shooting, saying it was more like four or five weeks after the event. Second, he denied telling her in relation to that shooting that he donned a disguise, staked out a visibly accessible area and only wounded Mrs. Wilson because he did not gauge the thickness of the kitchen window. Third, though he testified that six or seven days after his exâwife was killed he went to Palm Springs and spent some time with Ms. Mendell, he denied telling her that it was "a strange feeling to blow your wife away". He testified instead that Ms. Mendell asked him whether he killed her and he stated, "I cannot imagine what a strange feeling that that would be. No, of course not." Fourth, he denied packaging a revolver in a toy shower box and bringing it to Canada. He described this allegation as a "pretty good trick", concocted by Ms. Mendell.</span></p>

He stated that it was stolen from his condominium in Palm Springs and he suspected a cleaning woman took it. He also admitted using Hollow Point bullets, but only to practice shooting in the desert. He stated he knew nothing about the holster found in his car by Mr. Guillaum; he testified that his holster was of a different type and had his name on it.</span></p>

In crossâexamination, he suggested that it may have been planted by someone.</span></p>

He said his initial contact with Mr. Anderson grew out of an attempt in November 1980 to purchase or rent land from the Andersons. No arrangement was concluded and the matter was left open so that Mr. Anderson would have a chance to discuss the proposition with his mother. Anderson contacted him a few months later to inform him that the land would be rented to someone else. During that meeting, the conversation shifted to the subject of Ron Graham. Thatcher testified that Anderson told him that Graham may have been "cutting corners" in his construction work, and that he, Thatcher, agreed to give Anderson some money to cover expenses while checking out this possibility. That spring, Thatcher stated that he met Anderson on a country road and the latter told him that two men from Calgary were coming into town. Thatcher told Anderson where he would be the following day, and Anderson thereafter showed up with a man Thatcher subsequently knew to be Charlie Wilde, though he did not know Wilde "from a bale of hay" until the preliminary hearing. At that meeting, they told him that they could "lay a good licking on [Ron Graham] or ...go even further than that". Thatcher told them that he wasn't interested in the idea, though he agreed to pay Anderson $500 expenses in connection with the trip from Calgary. </span></p>

After exchanging a few remarks, they went to the appellant's parking space behind the Legislature. There AnÂ­derson&nbsp;complained that his car had been towed away from the Legislative grounds. Thatcher testified that he arranged for its return, and later talked to Anderson in the carââa Dodgeââwhere inadvertently he left his top coat, scarf and gloves. He said he did not realize this until some time later, and did not see Anderson again until May 1, 1984, the day their conversation was recorded by bodyâpack.</span></p>

He explained various parts of the conversation to the jury. For example, he said he believed Anderson was referring to the top coat, scarf, and gloves, when he said: "Umm, I got rid of the ah stuff outta' the car." And he, Thatcher, was referring to a Tansy Mustard Plant he spotted in the field when he said "sonâofâaâbitch" after Anderson said "Ahh, the other one." Thatcher said he talked to Anderson on this occasion because he was interested in knowing what the police were doing and saying to Anderson. Moreover, he stated that AnÂ­derson&nbsp;felt he had $500 coming to him, and that he, Thatcher, did not want a person of Anderson's temperament on his back. Anderson, he suggested, was capable of burning granaries or haystacks if annoyed. He wanted to keep on reasonably good terms with him. Accordingly, on Thursday evening, just before dark, he left the sum of $550 for Mr. Anderson at the spot where it was located by the police.</span></p>

Thatcher testified that on New Year's Eve his and Collver's families went out to dinner, consumed a great deal of alcohol, and returned to Collver's dude ranch for a New Year's Eve party. He testified that "Dick is the cheapest drunk in the world" and that, the next morning, when he went down to the kitchen, Collver was sitting there in "that never never land when you are still half drunk and hung over". Thatcher stated that at that time he sought advice from Collver on the legal options available to him in relation to his marital problems, and that Collver told him that he could go to court, settle, or kill his wife. Thatcher testified that Collver was not serious about the third option, that Collver was hung over and used the third option as a rhetorical way of attempting to persuade Thatcher to settle with his wife.</span></p>

In so doing, it is clear they rejected the appellant's contention that he was not criminally involved in the killing, and were satisfied the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

By failing to deal with the evidence in that manner, the charge was confusing, particularly in light of the Crown's emphasis on the appellant's guilt as principal and not as an aider and abetter. When one couples that with the statement of the trial judge, that the failure of the Crown to adduce evidence that another individual actually did the act would not preclude the jury from finding that the killing was done on behalf of the appellant was, an invitation to the jury to find, in the absence of evidence that there was another person acting together with the appellant, that the appellant could be an aider and abetter to the offence.

Before doing so, I should again point out that the primary theory of the Crown was that Thatcher personally killed JoAnn Wilson though it wished to leave open the possibility that Thatcher may have committed the murder indirectly, by hiring someone else to perform the physical act of killing. The trial judge, in charging the jury, rightly gave far more emphasis to the Crown's primary theory.</span></p>

There is some evidence which, if believed, points to his not having committed the crime personally. The facts are for the jury, and the trial judge was correct not to preclude the jury from considering all the alternatives. There is, of course, no burden on the Crown to point to a specific, identified person as the personal assailant of the victim. The trial judge was cognizant of this fact and he rightly instructed the jury in the following way:</span></p>

Nor is it your concern whether or not the person who actually committed the crime is known. If you are satisfied from the evidence that JoAnn Thatcher was murdered and that this accused aided or abetted in the commission of the murder, it is open to you to find him guilty of murder. But again if the Crown has failed to satisfy you that Colin Thatcher either committed the murder or that someone else did so, aided and abetted by Colin Thatcher, then you must give him the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.</span></p>

As stated, he pointed out that the actual perpetrator need not be identified. He thus accurately stated the law as to s. 21(1).</span></p>

I do not think he was wrong in this. Much of the Crown evidence was consistent with <u>either</u> Crown theory, and much of the defence evidence was consistent with either Thatcher's innocence or his guilt under s. 21(1). It is not incumbent on a trial judge to go through the evidence in a repetitive fashion which could only have bored the jury. Nor do I think we should assume jurors are so unintelligent that they will fail to see the obvious: the presence of a government car at the home of the victim, when combined with evidence suggesting that the man in the car was not Thatcher, may point to Thatcher's having aided and abetted; and surely they can discern that the alibi evidence, if believed, when combined with the murder weapon evidence, may point to a similar conclusion.</span></p>

The whole point of s. 21(1) is to put an aider or abettor on the same footing as the principal. To stress the difference between the Crown theories might leave a jury with the erroneous impression that it is vital for the jurors to decide individually and collectively which way the victim was killed. But the correctness of this point hinges on issue (iii), below, and I will pursue it in that context.</span></p>

If the jury chose to draw this inference, the offence was murder as defined by s. 260, whether they or either of them meant that death should ensue or knew that death was likely to ensue. In such circumstances, it would be a matter of indifference which of the two struck the fatal blow or inflicted the fatal injury, since each would be liable in law for the act of the other.</span></p>

This policy concern was recognized long ago by Pollock C.B. in <i>R. v. Swindall and Osborne</i> (1846), 2 Car. &amp; K. 230, 175 E.R. 95, a case which predated the abolition of the distinction between principals and accomplices.</span></p>

Folkes and Ludds</i> (1832), 1 Mood. 354, 168 E.R. 1301, in which, upon Rand J.'s view of the case, the judges held that a defendant could be convicted by a jury on a count of having feloniously ravished the prosecutrix "either on the evidence going to the ravishment or that going to his secondary role as abettor".

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Thus, the common law generally drew no distinction between a principal in the first degree (someone who actually committed the offence) and a principal in the second degree (someone who was actually or constructively present but who only aided and abetted in the commission of the offence) for the purposes of indictment. The upshot of this rule was stated in East, <i>Pleas of the Crown</i> (1803), vol. 1, at p. 350: "the blow of one is, in law, the blow of all". The common law did, however, draw a distinction between principals and accessories. Accessories were those who conspired with the principal in the first degree or who aided and abetted him but were neither actually nor constructively present at the scene of the crime. See <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1876), 38 U.C.Q.B. 218, at pp. 227â28. Thus, if Thatcher aided and abetted, rather than personally committed, I do not think it is contended that he was necessarily physically present at the murder. Therefore, his case might well not fall within the old common law rule permitting one charge but two different possible modes of participation in the offence. But this is precisely the distinction that disappeared when Parliament abolished the common law distinction between principals and accessories. As Fauteux J. states in <i>Harder</i>, at p. 493, in relation to s. 21's predecessor:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

With them, of course, also disappeared, because being made no longer necessary, the relevant adjective rules related to the framing of the indictment of such persons who, not actually committing the offence charged, were then made, by statute, principals and equally party to, guilty of and punishable for the offence as if actually committed by them. It is unthinkable that, getting rid of the difficulties arising out of these prior distinctions, Parliament would, in the same breath, have created new ones by refusing to the Crown the right to indictââwhich right it had before, under common and statutory lawââas principal simpliciter, either as a principal in the second degree or an accessory before the fact, and this, under the regime of this new law holding each and all <i>particeps criminis</i> as being nothing less than principals.</span></p>

The law stipulates that both forms of participation are not only equally culpable, but should be treated as one single mode of incurring criminal liability. The Crown is not under a duty to separate the different forms of participation in a criminal offence into different counts. Obviously, if the charge against Thatcher had been separated into different counts, he might well have been acquitted on each count notwithstanding that each and every juror was certain beyond a reasonable doubt either that Thatcher personally killed his exâwife or that he aided and abetted someone else who killed his exâwife. This is precisely what s. 21 is designed to prevent.</span></p>

Moreover, if there is evidence before a jury that points to an accused either committing a crime personally or, alternatively, aiding and abetting another to commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did one or the other, it is "a matter of indifference" which alternative actually occurred: <i>Chow Bew</i>. It follows, in my view, that s. 21 precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. Why should the juror be compelled to make a choice on a subject which is a matter of legal indifference?</span></p>

However, where a number of matters are specified in the charge as together constituting one ingredient in the offence, and any one of them is capable of doing so, then it is enough to establish the ingredient that any one of them is proved; but (because of the first principle above) any such matter must be proved to the satisfaction of the whole jury. The jury should be directed accordingly, and it should be made clear to them as well that they should all be satisfied that the statement upon which they are agreed was an inducement as alleged.</span></p>

Gelowitz entitled "The <i>Thatcher</i> Appeal: A Question of Unanimity" (1986), 49 C.R. (3d) 129, argues that just as in <i>Brown</i>, where the English Court of Appeal held that "each ingredient of the offence must be proved to the satisfaction of each and every member of the jury," this Court ought to hold that the nature of Thatcher's participation must be proved to each and every juror before he can be convicted of "unlawfully causing" JoAnn Wilson's death.</span></p>

In a long, complicated trial it is absurd to suppose that twelve people could form the same opinion of each item of evidence, and it is absurd to suppose that the Crown could ever prove or explain beyond a reasonable doubt every detail of a murder. A defendant at a murder trial should obviously not be acquitted if some jurors think a .38 calibre bullet was used and others think that a .357 calibre bullet was used. The appellant submits, however, that the jurors ought to be unanimous as to the "material facts" making out the offence. He does not provide a definition of "material facts", except to rely on Mr. Gelowitz for the proposition that jurors must be "in substantial agreement as to just what an accused has done". This argument, however, overlooks the whole point of s. 21, as I have said, which makes the distinction between principals and aiders and abettors legally irrelevant.</span></p>

Eveleigh L.J. acknowledged that jurors could arrive at their conclusions by different routes. Jurors "may be able to say that, whichever way one looks at it, the case is proved". To be sure, Eveleigh L.J. also articulated the propositions referred to previously. But, in my opinion, s. 21 does not create "ingredients" in the offence of murder, in the same way that each particular "misrepresentation" was an ingredient in the offence of <i>Brown</i>. As I read Eveleigh L.J.'s remarks, his second proposition is restricted to cases in which "a number of matters are specific in the charge". This would be analogous to the case when there were several counts in an indictment. If Thatcher had been charged on two counts, of course unanimity would be required in respect of any count for which he is convicted. Such a conclusion flows from the proposition that a verdict stands for guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt, of that for which the accused has been charged. In the present case, Thatcher was charged that he did "unlawfully cause the death of JoAnn Kay Wilson and did thereby commit first degree murder". The charge was carefully worded, and there is no injustice in his conviction on the indictment irrespective of whether the jurors shared the same view as to the most likely manner in which Thatcher committed the murder. </span></p>

Every single juror was, evidently, solidly convinced that (c) was simply not what occurred. Each one was certain that the true state of affairs was (a) or (b). Even if we suppose, as the appellant would have us do, that the jurors individually went beyond thinking in terms of (a) or (b) and specifically opted for one theory, and that some jurors thought only (a) could have occurred and others thought only (b) could have occurred, I am far from convinced that there would have been any injustice from convicting Thatcher. As stated, there is no legal difference between the two. Much is made of the fact that (a) and (b) are <u>factually</u> inconsistent theories, in the sense that evidence proving (a) tends to disprove (b). But this is really only true of one category of evidence, namely identification and alibi evidence. The overwhelming mass of evidence against Thatcher was consistent with <u>either</u> theory. In particular, the evidence tracing the murder weapon to Thatcher was highly probative, as were his statements to various witnesses (prior to the murder) of his intention to kill JoAnn Wilson, and his statement to Lynn Mendell (after the murder) that he had "blown away" his wife.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Suppose the evidence in a case is absolutely crystal clear that when X and Y entered Z's house, Z was alive, and when X and Y left, Z was dead. Suppose that in their evidence each of X and Y says that the other of them murdered Z but each admits to having aided and abetted. Are X and Y each to be acquitted if some of the jurors differ as to which of X and Y actually committed the offence? I can see absolutely no reason in policy or law to uphold such an egregious conclusion. The appellant's submission ignores the very reason why Parliament abolished the old common law distinctions: namely, they permitted guilty persons to go free. As Professor Peter MacKinnon points out in, "Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz and Stuart" (1986), 51 C.R. (3d) 134, at p. 135, if an accused is to be acquitted in situations when every juror is convinced that the accused committed a murder in one of two ways, merely because the jury cannot agree on <u>which</u> of the two ways, "it is difficult to imagine a situation more likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute ââ and deservedly so."</span></p>

Moreover the jury does not have to choose between two versions. It is not because they would not believe the accused that they would then have to agree with Landry's version. The jurors cannot accept his version, or any part of it, unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having regard to all the evidence, that the events took place in this manner; otherwise the accused is entitled, unless a fact has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, to the finding of fact the most favourable to him, provided of course that it is based on evidence in the record and not mere speculation.</span></p>

The defence evidence was simple, however, and the Crown's case was complex, relying on circumstantial evidence from a large number of witnesses. It is simply inappropriate to try to measure the fairness of the charge by reference to quantity.</span></p>

It should be noted in this respect that at the outset of his charge the trial judge was clear as to the respective duties of the judge and jury. He stated:</span></p>

This is not a light duty because if a crime has been committed, in this case, the murder of a female individual, it is your obligation to so find. Likewise you have a duty to this accused to see that he is not improperly convicted.</span></p>

It is your duty and your responsibility and yours alone to decide those facts in accordance with the oaths you took at the outset of the trial.

On the second day of their deliberations, after requesting information the previous evening, the jury reviewed portions of the evidence given by numerous witnesses, including Thatcher himself. In my view, the trial judge gave a fair picture of the defence. As Lord Goddard C.J., in <i>R. v. ClaytonâWright</i> (1948), 33 Cr. App. R. 22, at p. 29, states, a trial judge is not required "to paint in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of the evidence". The jury deliberated for approximately four days. They returned a verdict of guilty. In my opinion, the charge of the trial judge cannot be read as unfair. I may add that I think there is some merit to the Crown's argument that Thatcher would not have benefited from a more thorough review of the defence evidence.</span></p>

I should, however, qualify my concurrence in those of his reasons addressing the ground he refers to as "<i>Jury Unanimity as to the Material Facts</i>".</span></p>

I would suggest, however, that it fails because of the nature of the evidence in this case. It is true that the Crown presented two factually inconsistent theories: that the appellant actually killed the deceased or that he aided and abetted the killer. The overwhelming mass of the evidence against the appellant, however, was consistent with both theories and pointed only to his participation in the murder. The jury could not have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of one theory to the exclusion of the other, but must have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the murder, either as principal or aider and abettor. Since, as the Chief Justice points out, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec21subsec1" target="_blank">s. 21(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> makes the distinction between participation as a principal and participation as aider and abettor legally irrelevant, it was not necessary for the jury to decide on the form of his participation and the jury was correct in convicting. As Peter MacKinnon wrote in "Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz and Stuart" (1986), 51 C.R. (3d) 134, at p. 137:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Depending on the nature of the evidence presented by the Crown, the jury unanimity issue may arise in any case where the Crown alleges factually inconsistent theories, even if those theories relate to the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. If the Crown presents evidence which tends to inculpate the accused under one theory and exculpate him under the other, then the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they wish to rely on such evidence, then they must be unanimous as to the theory they adopt. Otherwise, the evidence will be taken into account by some jurors to convict the accused under one theory while the fact that the evidence exculpates the accused under the other theory is being disregarded by the other jurors who are taking the latter route. In effect, the jury would be adding against the accused the inculpatory elements of evidence which cannot stand together because they are inconsistent. </span></p>

I have some concerns, not addressed by him, however, that I would wish to underline.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

There may, however, be cases where the interrelationship between competing Crown theories and the evidence adduced in relation thereto will not justify a verdict of guilt. In each case, therefore, it will be for the trial judge, having regard to the nature of the offence, the theories of the parties, and the totality of the evidence, to realistically assess the possibility that the evidence will be used improperly, and to direct the jury accordingly. Suffice it to say, however, the present is not such a case.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Rather, it is merely one example of a situation where the Crown is relying on alternative theories of culpability to found an accused's guilt. The fact that s. 21 makes the particular nature of the accused's involvement in an offence legally irrelevant does not, in my view, in and of itself justify conviction on the basis of mutually exclusive or alternative theories of culpability. Were it otherwise, concerns would be raised dangerously akin to those flowing from multiplicious counts. Concerns about multiplicity of counts and jury unanimity are functional, real concerns embodying society's preâeminent desire to avoid injustice to accused persons and, as such, cannot be explained away by the mere invocation of a legal fiction. I cannot believe that such a result would have been in the contemplation of Parliament in enacting s. 21. Nor do I read the Chief Justice's judgment as countenancing this result.</span></p>
