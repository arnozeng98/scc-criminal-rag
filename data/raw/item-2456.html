   <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law — Defences — Entrapment — Trafficking conviction — Conviction resulting from incidents instigated by undercover officer — Whether or not defence of entrapment existed and applicable — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 7(3).</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">This appeal was from appellant's conviction of trafficking in cocaine. An undercover policeman and an informer had repeatedly and persistently requested drugs from appellant, at home and at work, over the course of two months despite his lack of interest and despite the absence of no reasonable cause to believe him to be involved in the illicit drug trade. A certain friendship developed during that time, and eventually, appellant reluctantly put the two men in contact with a supplier. The charges laid related to one occasion where cocaine passed from the supplier, through appellant to the undercover officer and to a second occasion where the drugs passed directly from the supplier to the officer following an implied threat of violence made to appellant. Arguments as to whether the "defence of entrapment" existed, and if so, as to whether it applied here, were considered at trial and on appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Laskin C.J. and Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Martland, Dickson, Beetz and Chouinard JJ.: The defence of entrapment, assuming it to be available under Canadian law, did not arise on the facts of this case that was the unanimous conclusion of the four British Columbia judges who had already considered the matter. This Court should not retry the case and arrive at different findings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 419]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Ritchie J.: The question of entrapment can only enter into the determination of an accused's guilt or innocence where police tactics are such as to leave no room for the formation of independent criminal intent by the accused. The mere fact that the crime was committed at the "solicitation" of an <i>agent provocateur </i>does not, standing alone, support a defence of entrapment. The defence of entrapment might have been supported here if the accused had been coerced to cooperate with the police plan under the threat of violence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Laskin C.J. and Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ., <i>dissenting: </i>The doctrine of entrapment is rooted in the common law's recognition of the need for some element of judicial control and should be recognized and applied here. Section 7(3) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>allows the criminal courts to adopt common law defences; those defences did not crystallize when the statute was enacted. Indeed, as entrapment may not technically be a defence in that it results in a stay of prosecution rather than an acquittal, reliance on s. 7(3) might be unnecessary. The doctrine's principal characteristics are: 1) that the police instigate an offence and through their conduct ensnare the accused into committing it; 2) that the scheme be to gain evidence for the prosecution of the accused for the instigated crime; and 3) that the crime be induced through deceit, fraud, trickery, reward or other means. The scheme must be in all circumstances so shocking and outrageous as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The doctrine is not applicable where the true purpose of the police initiative is to put the enforcement officers in a position to obtain evidence of an offence when committed, absent the other circumstances noted. Here, this shocking and outrageous enterprise was earmarked with all the trappings of entrapment.</span></p>

.8pt">(dissenting)—The </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">appellant was charged with two counts of trafficking in cocaine on or about October 3 and October 13, 1977. At his trial before McGivern P.C.J. the sale of the cocaine to an R.C.M.P. undercover agent was admitted. The defence raised was entrapment.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In June of 1977 the accused was employed as a hairdresser in North Vancouver. He was approached by the manager of the shop, one André, who said that he had a friend who was Iooking for a gram of cocaine. Amato responded that he did not think he knew of anyone from whom it could be obtained. Amato's evidence, which I shall now summarize, is that he had never used cocaine nor trafficked in it. Two days later, André's friend, who identified himself as Don, called Amato at work. Amato told Don that he didn't really know where he could obtain cocaine but as Don was a friend of André he would keep his ears open. Shortly thereafter Amato switched places of employment to another hairdressing salon. Don called him there repeating his earlier request and saying that he had obtained his number from André.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Don was in fact Don Langvin, a paid police informer whose job was to introduce traffickers to the police. He is himself known as a trafficker who was granted immunity from prosecution in relation to an incident where he was found in possession of three ounces of heroin. He was also paid $200 a week and received a lump sum of $9,500 to assist in relocating at the end of the operation. Over the period during which he was involved with Amato, Langvin did not carry a recording device or make any written notes or reports. He reported verbally</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 421]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">to his "handler" who for most of the time was Constable Godwin of the R.C.M.P. Godwin has no notes nor any recollection of reports made to him by Langvin of his dealings with Amato prior to October 3 some four months after Langvin's first contact with Amato. Godwin and Langvin were meeting three or four times per week over this period. In response to the trial judge's repeated inquiries, the Crown stated that Langvin could not be located to testify. Here I have summarized and inserted in the course of Amato's evidence some testimony given by Godwin.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">When Langvin called Amato at his new place of work back in June he was told by Amato that André was mistaken if he thought he could be counted on to obtain cocaine. Langvin responded that he did not know many people in North Vancouver, that he had to go through André, that he was very desperate to "score" a gram and that he had been looking for some time without success. Langvin continued to call Amato through the summer. Between the third week in June and early September he called at least fifteen to twenty times, mostly at work. In August he came to Amato's work place and asked him to join him for a coffee and to look at his car. Langvin owned an antique Rover which interested Amato because he thought Langvin had connections and Amato claims he hoped to own one some day. Amato describes the relationship between him and Langvin at that time in his examination-in-chief at trial:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Q. And did you have any intention of obtaining cocaine for him or selling it to him?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A. Not at all. I was just trying to be a friend with <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">him because he—he seemed like a very clean-cut</span> kid and he-he just seemed like a person that I <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt">could probably benefit from because he had deals</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt">on cars and things like that, but he seemed like an</span> all 'round nice guy. To me it didn't—didn't dawn on me.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">In the first part of September Langvin visited twice at Amato's apartment to discuss a party which was being held at the end of the month. Langvin had some friends coming from California</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 422]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">and said they wanted some cocaine for the party. Amato said he would ask amongst his friends to see if he could "turn him on to someone". He asked some hairdresser friends but they could not come up with anything.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In mid-August Amato called June Lee to ask if she could help to obtain some cocaine. She is an ex-girlfriend with whom Amato had lived for three years but they had broken off their relationship two and a half years previous to this time. Amato says he turned to June Lee because her brother was involved with heroin. Amato wanted her to contact her brother's girlfriend as he believed her to have some contact in the drug business. June Lee wasn't interested but Amato called her back three or four times over the next month. She did not want to "stick her neck out". By mid-September June Lee changed her mind and arrangements were made to sell one gram of cocaine to Langvin for $100. Amato met Langvin in a parking lot, took the $100, went to June Lee's place and returned with the cocaine for Langvin. Amato received no money or cocaine from the transaction. This first transaction was in September.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">When Amato delivered the first gram to Langvin the latter raised the possibility of getting a half ounce for his friends who were coming from California for the party. Amato refused but Langvin called him the next day at work. Amato said he had done it only as a favour and told Langvin he was scared by the whole thing. Langvin continued to call Amato daily at the shop. Amato refused repeatedly. On October 3 Langvin came to Amato's shop where they went out behind it and after talking about cars Langvin told Amato that the friends from California had arrived. Amato was asked if he could do everything in his power to get some more cocaine. He called June Lee who refused and hung up. He called her back and pressed her to do "a last little favour". After a few calls she agreed to provide a half ounce of cocaine for $1,100. Langvin and Amato were to meet in a parking lot but when Langvin showed up he had his friend Gary (who was in fact Godwin) with him. Amato refused to go through with the deal at first but he was reassured that Godwin was "cool"</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 423]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">and that he was Langvin's best friend. Godwin and Langvin gave Amato $1,100 and he went off to meet June Lee who went somewhere else to get the cocaine. Amato returned with it and Godwin began discussing quality and quantity and Amato says he was "coming on very strong, like a dealer". Amato says he told Godwin and Langvin:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... 'Look I am not a dealer.' ... 'As far as I'm concerned </span><span lang="EN-CA">l'm </span><span lang="EN-CA">not doing this voluntarily. I'm into this predicament because I've been pushed this far and it's not—it's not—it's not going to happen. </span><span lang="EN-CA">You </span><span lang="EN-CA">know, as soon as this is over I just don't want to see any of the both of yous again.'</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">As Amato left the car he said to Godwin and Langvin, "Forget it. This won't happen again". Langvin wasn't heard from again. Godwin called two days later and congratulated Amato on how smoothly it had gone. Godwin called a few more times at the shop saying that he wanted to obtain three ounces of cocaine, offering a price of $6,000. Amato told him to forget it and Godwin replied, "You just tell your people that". Godwin continued to call at work but Amato refused the calls saying he was too busy. On October 12 Godwin called seven or eight times and at the end of the day Amato called him back. Amato told him that he was washing his hands of him and hung up. Godwin called right back telling Amato that he had friends in town who were expecting three ounces. Godwin said he just wanted to have a chat with him for ten minutes and Amato agreed to meet him. Godwin mentioned that he was in a jam. Godwin told Amato that he didn't have to be frightened because he always dealt with guns and that he didn't "screw around".

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">June Lee who said that maybe something could be arranged for the following day, October 13. Godwin was still very anxious and asked Amato to try one more time. Amato called June Lee back and arrangements were made for a deal in the early morning of October 13. Godwin met Amato at 11 p.m. (October 12) in a parking lot. Godwin insisted he must personally pass the money to June Lee. Together they went to June Lee's place where they met in a basement apartment and Godwin purchased two and a half ounces of cocaine. Amato received no money and no cocaine for his part in the deal. Fie and Godwin left the apartment separately.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Godwin called twice two days later and again the following day looking for Lee's phone number. After that time there was no further contact between Amato and Godwin. Two subsequent deals were made with Lee by Godwin and she pleaded guilty to the three counts. Amato was arrested five months after the third transaction and was charged with trafficking in respect of the two dates in October.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In summary, there were three transactions:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. one gram delivered by Amato to Langvin some time in September in respect of which no charge was laid;</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">2. a half ounce delivered by Amato to Godwin on October 3;</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">3. two and a half ounces delivered by Lee to Godwin on October 13.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Charges were laid with respect to numbers 2 and 3 only.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This account, with the exception of the reference to Godwin's evidence, is taken from the testimony of Amato given at his trial. André was not called to testify. Langvin could not be located despite the efforts of defence counsel to determine his whereabouts. The only evidence other than that of Amato which relates to the pressure being put upon him by Langvin and Godwin is the evidence of Godwin which commenced with the meeting in the parking lot on October 3. There are some conflicts between these two accounts of the period from October 3 to October 13. Godwin denies</span></p>

Godwin says there were five phone calls during that period, three of which were initiated by Amato. Godwin also says that Amato discussed receiving an "end", some cocaine </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">off </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">the top for himself, although he doesn</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In present case, the Crown was unable to produce the witness who originally arranged for the undercover officer to meet the accused, Amato. His evidence would have been extremely useful to assist me in making my determinations of fact. He could have corroborated the <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">evidence of the Crown or he could have corroborated the</span> evidence of the Defence. I believe he should have been called by the Crown. His absence has restricted the Defence from making a full answer in defence to the charge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am satisfied that in fairness to the accused I must presume that he would have given evidence consistent with that given by the Defence. For that reason, I am prepared for the sake of these reasons for judgment, to assume that the findings of fact ought to be made on the basis of the evidence tendered by the Defence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">There is some difficulty in determining whether the above passage refers to Amato's version of the events only up to October 3 or if it extends to include the period ending October 13. In subsequently reviewing the evidence of that period the learned trial judge says:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The third transaction testified to by the accused Amato concerned some two and a half ounces of cocaine. On this occasion, the undercover Policeman dealt directly with Amato to arrange the deal and then concluded it with the accused Lee. In this transaction, Amato alleged for the first time, according to my recollection of the evidence, that he was threatened by the undercover Policeman and the threat was one to the effect that if the deal could not be made, then certain people would visit Amato at his place of employment. This information presumably was passed on to the accused Lee. Amato testified that on the basis of the threat and persistence of the undercover Officer, he was forced to arrange the transaction which eventually took place.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am satisfied that the evidence </span><span lang="EN-CA">in </span><span lang="EN-CA">this case falls far short of the evidence required at law to establish the defence of entrapment. The evidence amounts no more than to persistent solicitation by the informer and the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">undercover Officer to persuade the accused Amato to </span><span lang="EN-CA">engage in trafficking of cocaine. Amato's dealings with<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> </span>Ms. Lee do not permit her to be successful in relying on<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> </span>the defence of entrapment because she merely agreed to<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> go along with her friend.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">This subsequent reference to the evidence of Amato concerning the events between October 3 and 13 indicates that the trial judge proceeded on the basis that Amato's story was credible through-out, or at least was to be so taken for the reasons he gave, and that the defence of entrapment was rejected with reference to Amato's version of the events which had taken place.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The Court of Appeal also proceeded on the basis that Amato's story was to be believed in its entirety. Taggart J.A. reviewed the third transaction which occurred on October 13 as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In addition, on the third occasion when cocaine passed between the persons in the house and Lee and the <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">undercover police officer, the Appellant was induced to</span> go to his source of supply not only by importuning on the part of the undercover police officer but as well by <span style="letter-spacing:
-.2pt">reason of threats of the use of force by persons for whom</span> the undercover police officer said he was obtaining the cocaine.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">In the light of these comments I come to the conclusion that the account of the appellant was accepted as credible and that the issue of the application of entrapment should be disposed of on that basis.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Returning to the facts it should be noted that prior to October 3, 1977, Amato was neither known to nor suspected by the police as a drug trafficker. Neither is there evidence that a police operation was being directed through him against Lee or any other police suspect. The evidence in short reveals a random contact with Amato by Langvin, a police agent, through an innocent intermediary (Amato's boss) who plays no further part in the story.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The trial judge apparently accepted that the defence of entrapment was open as a matter of law in Canada and he referred to the judgment of</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">As seen from the above the trial judge was of the view that the evidence fell "far short of the evidence required at law to establish the defence of entrapment".

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am satisfied that I do not have to incarcerate you. I'm satisfied, however, that I must impose some monetary punishment.

If there be such a defence for an accused in the criminal law, several matters must be determined:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(a) the source of authority in the courts to give recognition to the defence;</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(b) the nature and range of offences in respect of which this defence may be available;</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(c) the constituent elements which must be present;</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(d) the remedy or result of its successful application.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">The proponents of this defence generally seek to advance it as something necessary to bring fairness or fundamental justice into the criminal law when the state agencies of enforcement resort to methods of law enforcement which threaten the integrity of the criminal justice system or bring shame to the state. Put another way, the defence is seen as an offset to or a control mechanism for over-zealous crime detection and prosecution where inducement or incitement leads the otherwise innocent to the commission of an offence. There are shades and variants of these elements which make the defence difficult of definition and the doctrine delicate to apply.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">As the Chief Justice said in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Kirzner </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">at p. 492:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">There is, of course, a balance to be struck between giving reasonable latitude to the police in the employment of stratagems to control the spread of crime, especially in the case of the illegal drug traffic, and controlling behaviour that goes beyond any reasonable latitude. American jurisdictions have, on a constitutional basis, sought to control the introduction of illegally obtained evidence; in England, the Courts have continued to exercise a discretionary power to control the admissibility of evidence that would operate unfairly against an accused. Control techniques may thus relate to the recognition of substantive defences or to rules against the admission of evidence or to a discretion as to its reception. Abuse of process or stay of proceedings have also been put forward as techniques of control.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">and at p. 494:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The problem which has caused judicial concern is the <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">one which arises from the police-instigated crime, where</span> the police have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere decoy work and have actively organized a scheme of ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to prosecute the person so caught. In my opinion, it is only in this situation that it is proper to speak of entrapment and to <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">consider what effect this should have on the prosecution</span> of a person who has thus been drawn into the commission of an offence.</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">We think that this established principle of construc</span><span lang="EN-CA">tion is applicable here. We are unable to conclude that it<span style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">By this theory the Court avoided claiming for itself a power to forbid the prosecution of a person whose conduct appears to come squarely within the statute. The issue was seen by the Court as whether the defendant is a person otherwise innocent whom the government is seeking to punish for an alleged offence which is "the product of the creative industry of its own efforts". Chief Justice Hughes concluded at p. 451:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">If that is the fact, common justice requires that the accused be permitted to prove it.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The question then arose, of course, as to what the proper disposition should be on a successful application of the defence.

In </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

Chief Justice Hughes concluded at p. 452:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">We are of the opinion that upon the evidence pro<span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">duced in the instant case the defense of entrapment was</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">available and that the trial court was in error in holding</span> that as a matter of law there was no entrapment and in refusing to submit the issue to the jury.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">A minority opinion by Mr. Justice Roberts, concurred in by Justices Brandeis and Stone, took the view, at p. 454, that entrapment should be defined as:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the minority view the doctrine of entrapment rests on a fundamental rule of public policy, at pp. 457 and 459, namely:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The protection of its own functions and the preservation of the purity of its own temple belongs only to the court. It is the province of the court and of the court alone to protect itself and the government from such prostitution of the criminal law. The violation of the principles of justice by the entrapment of the unwary into crime should be dealt with by the court no matter by whom or at what stage of the proceedings the facts are brought to its attention. Quite properly it may discharge the prisoner upon a writ </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">of </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">habeas corpus. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Equally well may it quash the indictment or entertain and try a plea in bar. But its powers do not end there. Proof of entrapment, at any stage of the case, requires the court to stop the prosecution, direct that the indictment be quashed, and the defendant set at liberty.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">[…]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The applicable principle is that courts must be closed to the trial of a crime instigated by the government's <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">own agents.

The accused had been repeatedly importuned by an informer who, like the accused, was attending a clinic for treatment for narcotic addiction. The informer claimed that he was not responding to treatment and the repeated requests for assistance in obtaining narcotics were premised upon the informer's feigned suffering. The majority applied <i>Sorrells </i>and continued to define entrapment as a defence "where the criminal conduct was the product of creative activity of law enforcement officials". The government reply relied on the defendant's criminal record to establish "a ready complaisance" to commit the offence. In <i>Sorrells </i>the case was remanded with the entrapment issue being left to the jury. In <i>Sherman, </i>however, the Court directed a dismissal no doubt on the grounds of overwhelming evidence.

The view of Frankfurter J., at p. 380, was that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Insofar as they are used as instrumentalities in the administration of criminal justice, the federal courts have an obligation to set their face against enforcement of the law by lawless means or means that violate rationally vindicated standards of justice, and to refuse to sustain such methods by effectuating them .... Public confidence in the fair and honorable administration of justice, upon which ultimately depends the rule of law, is the transcending value at stake.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">Following this line of thought the crucial question becomes whether the police conduct in a particular case falls below "standards, to which common feelings respond, for the proper use of governmental power". The position of the majority in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Sor<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">rells is </span></span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:
.3pt">commented upon at p. 382:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The intention referred to, therefore, must be a general<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> intention or predisposition to commit, whenever the opportunity should arise, crimes of the kind solicited, </span>and in proof of such a predisposition evidence has often<span style="letter-spacing:
.3pt"> </span>been admitted to show the defendant's reputation, criminal activities, and prior disposition. The danger of preju<span style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">dice in such a situation, particularly if the issue of entrapment must be submitted to the jury and disposed </span>of by a general verdict of guilty or innocent, is evident.<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> The defendant must either forego the claim of entrapment or run the substantial risk that, in spite of instructions, the jury will allow a criminal record or bad reputation to weigh in its determination of guilt of the specific offense of which he stands charged. Furthermore, a test that looks to the character and predisposition of the defendant rather than the conduct of the police loses sight of the underlying reason for the defense of entrapment.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 434]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It follows therefore that a court enunciating this view must conclude, irrespective of the defendant's past record, that certain police conduct to ensnare him into further crime cannot be tolerated and hence the defence of entrapment applies. The position of the accused is not the criterion of the test but rather the conduct of the public authority (at p. 383):</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Permissible police activity does not vary according to the</span><span lang="EN-CA"> particular defendant concerned; surely if two suspects have been solicited at the same time in the same <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">manner, one should not go to jail simply because he has</span> been convicted before and is said to have a criminal disposition.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">While recognizing that the police may act so as to detect those engaged in criminal conduct and those who are ready and willing to commit further crimes, the test as to entrapment must be that (at p. 384):</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... in holding out inducements they should act in such a <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">manner as is likely to induce to the commission of crime</span> only these persons and not others who would normally avoid crime and through self-struggle resist ordinary temptations. This test shifts attention from the record and predisposition of the particular defendant to the conduct of the police and the likelihood, objectively considered, that it would entrap only those ready and willing to commit crime. It is as objective a test as the subject matter permits, .. .</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The minority acknowledges that the scale of police conduct to be condemned by the doctrine must be such as is likely to induce those not otherwise ready and willing to commit crime to do so, and this type of conduct must "be picked out from case to case as new situations arise involving different crimes and new methods of detection" (p. 384). Like Justice Roberts in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Sorrells, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">the minority in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">Sherman </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">concluded at p. 385 that the test was one for the court and not for the jury:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Only the court, through the gradual evolution of explicit</span><span lang="EN-CA"> standards in accumulated precedents, can do this with the degree of certainty that the wise administration of criminal justice demands.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Frankfurter J. does not stipulate as to whether the proper disposition is a quashing of the charge as proposed by Roberts J. in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

He concurred with the result of the majority which was to remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Again in 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court returned to entrapment in the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">United States v. Russell, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">411 U.S. 423. The police investigator had supplied an essential and, although legally obtainable, difficult to obtain ingredient in the manufacture of 'speed' in return for one-half of the drug to be produced. The conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit because of "the intolerable degree of government participation in the criminal enterprise" ((1972), 459 F. 2d 671). The trial judge had stated the law to be:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Where a person already has the willingness and the readiness to break the law, the mere fact that the government agent provides what appears to be a favorable opportunity is not entrapment.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">By a five-to-four majority the Supreme Court restored the conviction. Rehnquist J., for the majority, followed the majority judgments in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Sorrells </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">and </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Rehnquist J. concluded in favour of the "subjective" approach at p. 434:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Nor does it seem particularly desirable for the law to<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> grant complete immunity from prosecution to one who </span>himself planned to commit a crime, and then committed<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> it, simply because government undercover agents sub</span>jected him to inducements which might have seduced a<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> hypothetical individual who was not so predisposed.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 436]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is clear that in the view of the majority in <i>Russell </i>the defence of entrapment is not to be used as a flexible yardstick in assessing the conduct of the prosecution. Rehnquist J. continued, at p. 435:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">But the defense of entrapment enunciated in those opinions was not intended to give the federal judiciary a "chancellor's foot" veto over law enforcement practices of which it did not approve. The execution of the federal laws under our Constitution is confided primarily to the Executive Branch of the Government, subject to applicable constitutional and statutory limitations and to judicially fashioned rules to enforce those limitations.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Four members of the Court dissented in two judgments. Douglas J. with Brennan J. concurring followed the dissents in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Sorrells </span></i>and <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.5pt">Sherman </span></i>and concluded that the federal prosecutor here played "a debased role" when he became the "instigator" of the crime by supplying an ingredient needed to manufacture the illegal drug. Stewart J. dissented (Brennan and Marshall JJ. concurring) and likewise adopted the dissenting viewpoint in the two prior cases. The <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.5pt">Sorrells </span></i>and <i><span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Sherman </span></i>majorities in this view stand for the limitation of the entrapment doctrine "to those who would be otherwise innocent", that is those who would not have committed the crime but for the government's inducement (p. 440). Stewart J. would apply the principle of the minority view in both cases and thereby place the focus upon "whether the police conduct falls below standards for the proper use of governmental power", or as Stewart J. put it at p. 441:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Phrased another way, the question is whether—regardless of the predisposition to crime of the particular defendant involved—the governmental agents have acted in such a way as is likely to instigate or create a criminal offense. Under this approach, the determina<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">tion of the lawfulness of the Government's conduct must</span> be made—as it is on all questions involving the legality of law enforcement methods—by the trial judge, not the jury.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 437]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The minority prefers an application whereby the "predisposed" or "otherwise innocent" condition of the defendant is irrelevant because "this subjective test means that the Government is permitted to entrap a person with a criminal record or bad reputation, and then to prosecute him for the manufactured crime ... " [pp. 443-44].</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">From a review of the earlier decisions the appropriate rule in the minority view is expressed to be <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(per </span></i>Stewart J. at p. 445):</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">But when the agents' involvement in criminal activi</span><span lang="EN-CA">ties goes beyond the mere offering of such an opportunity, and when their conduct is of a kind that could <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt">induce or instigate the commission of a crime by one not</span> ready and willing to commit it, then—regardless of the character or propensities of the particular person induced—I think entrapment has occurred.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">On principle the supply by a government agent to the defendant of an essential ingredient not otherwise obtainable was precisely the type of governmental conduct that amounts to entrapment in the view of the minority. Therefore, regardless of the defendant's "predisposition" or "innocence", he was entrapped. Neither dissenting judgment deals with the proper disposition of such a case. The reversal of the conviction at trial by the Court of Appeals may have entailed a quashing of the indictment or a dismissal of the charge but the Report [(1972), 459 F. 2d 671] is ambiguous. <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Vide </span></i>also <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">Hampton v. United States </span></i>(1976), 425 U.S. 484, where entrapment emerged in some of the judgments of the Court but as the discussion centered on constitutional aspects, the case is not here helpful.</span></p>

   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">(3)The defense afforded by this Section is unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense charged and the prosecution is <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">based on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a</span> person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment.</span></p>

The conventional view has been that the common law is always speaking. Some theories hold that it is a process of discovery, others of evolution. Whatever it might be properly classified to be in jurisprudence it would take the clearest and most precise language in a statute which purports to incorporate the principles of common law to so construe it as to crystallize the common law at the date of enactment of the statute. If so, the importation of common law principles would be limited to those which had crystallized and developed prior to the effective date of the statute. Section 7(3) does not employ such words. It is at most ambiguous, susceptible either to the static view or to the view that it makes reference to the common law as an evolving, developing system of rules and principles. Where a statute might be read as displacing the common law the appropriate canon of interpretation is a preference for that construction which preserves the rule of common law where it can be done consistently with the statute. By analogy the common law would be allowed to develop defences not inconsistent with the provisions of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.6pt">Code </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">if the construction adopted was prospective. For this conclusion I find support in the Report of the Imperial Commissioners of the draft Code of 1879, s. 19 of which is the forerunner of our present s. 7(3). The Commissioners explained the inclusion of s. 19 (now s. 7(3)) as follows, at Volume I, p. 10 of their Report:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">But whilst we exclude from the category of indictable<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> offences any culpable act or omission not provided for </span>by this or some other Act of Parliament, there is another</span></p>

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">branch of the unwritten law which introduces different considerations; namely, the principles which declare what circumstances amount to a justification or excuse for doing that which would be otherwise a crime, or at least would alter the quality of the crime. In the cases of ordinary occurrence, the decisions of the Courts and the opinions of great lawyers enable us to say how the principles of the law are to be applied. And so far the unwritten law may be digested without extreme difficulty and with practical advantage, and so far also it may be settled and rendered certain.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In our opinion the principles of the common law on such subjects, when rightly understood, are founded on sense and justice. There are a few points on which we venture to suggest alterations, which we shall afterwards state in detail. At present we desire to state that in our opinion it is, if not absolutely impossible, at least not practicable, to foresee all the various combinations of circumstances which may happen, but which are of so unfrequent occurrence that they have not hitherto been the subject of judicial consideration, although they might constitute a justification or excuse, and to use language at once so precise and clear and comprehensive as to include all cases that ought to be included, and not to include any case that ought to be excluded.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">We have already expressed our opinion that it is on the whole expedient that no crimes not specified in the Draft Code should be punished, though in consequence some guilty persons may thus escape punishment. But we do not think it desirable that, if a particular combination of circumstances arises of so unusual a character that the law has never been decided with reference to it, there should be any risk of a Code being so framed as to deprive an accused person of a defence to which the common law entitles him, and that it might become the duty of the judge to direct the jury that they must find him guilty, although the facts proved did show that he had a defence on the merits, and would have an undoubted claim to be pardoned by the Crown. While, therefore, digesting and declaring the law as applicable to the ordinary cases, we think that the common law so far as it affords a defence should be preserved in all cases not expressly provided for. This we have endeavoured to do by Section 19 of the Draft Code.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Applying the ordinary rule of construction where statutes and common law meet I conclude that s. 7(3) is the authority for the courts of criminal jurisdiction to adopt, if appropriate in the view of the court, defences including the defence of entrapment. The components of such a defence and the criteria for its application raise other issues.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Having found the way open for the development of defences not contrary to the provisions of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Code </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">or other statutes of Canada, consideration must be given to the juristic nature of the doctrine of entrapment. While it is frequently referred to in legal writings and sometimes in the courts as the 'defence of entrapment' it is not a defence in the traditional sense of that term. A successful defence leads to an acquittal on the charge, a determination that the offence has not been committed by the accused. Here, axiomatically, the crime from a physical point of view at least has been committed. Indeed it may be that the necessary intent and act have combined to form a complete crime. The successful application of the doctrine of entrapment, if it be a defence in the ordinary sense, would support an acquittal. The </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Criminal Code </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">authorizes acquittals in somewhat similar circumstances as in the case of the defence of duress. However, as will be seen later, the successful application of the concept of entrapment leads to a stay of prosecution, the court withholding its processes from the prosecution on the basis that such would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This is an exercise of the inherent powers of the courts. Entrapment is not in a traditional sense a defence. For convenience and ease of reference as well as to conform to the present vocabulary of the law, I sometimes refer to the doctrine as the 'defence of entrapment' although in strict law it is not a defence. Therefore, for this technical reason, it may not be necessary to invoke s. 7(3) other than to illustrate by analogy the continuing flexibility of the criminal law within and without the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Criminal Code.</span></i></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The availability of this defence in law and the proper constituent elements of the offence are closely entwined. Assuming the defence to be known to the common law and available in Canadian criminal law, in a proper case what are the component elements, the criteria to be met for its invocation? It is, of course, impossible to cast in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.5pt">futuro a </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">set of guides, principles, rules or yard-sticks with satisfactory precision and detail. This defence perhaps more than any other will succeed only in an unusual and delicately balanced set of circumstances. Case law will have to paint in the variants. The principal elements or characteristics of the defence are that an offence must be instigated, originated or brought about by the police and the accused must be ensnared into the commission of that offence by the police conduct; the purpose of the scheme must be to gain evidence for the prosecution of the accused for the very crime which has been so instigated; and the inducement may be but is not limited to deceit, fraud, trickery or reward, and ordinarily but not necessarily will consist of calculated inveigling and persistent importuning. The character of the initiative taken by the police is unaffected by the fact that the law enforcement agency is represented by a member of a police force or an undercover or other agent, paid or unpaid, but operating under the control of the police. In the result, the scheme so perpetrated must in all the circumstances be so shocking and outrageous <u>as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</u></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">At least one relevant circumstance in examining the character in law of the police conduct (such as persistent importuning) is whether the law enforcement agency had a reasonable suspicion that the accused would commit the offence without inducement. By itself and without more the predisposition in fact of the accused is not relevant to the availability of the defence. On the other hand, where the true purpose of the police initiative is to put the enforcement officers in a position to obtain evidence of an offence when committed, absent other circumstances already noted, the concept of entrapment does not arise.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 447]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Each case will turn within the influence of these factors according to its own circumstances. The root of the defence must, in my view, be the same as, for example, the exclusion of involuntary confessions. The integrity of the criminal justice system demands the rule. The exclusionary rule in any defence based upon the same ultimate considerations will be difficult of administration; but that is not a fatal consideration. Even if entrapment were found to be based upon a rule of statutory interpretation, as Chief Justice Hughes has said, its application, as for example in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Russell, </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">is difficult. Fine lines are drawn in the determination of guilt and innocence throughout the criminal law. The overriding need in the field which we have been examining on this appeal is for a device in the criminal justice system which will not expose the community to the spectacle of a person being convicted of a crime, the commission of which in substance was the work of the state itself.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">As we have seen the United States Supreme Court is ambivalent on the consequences of implementation of the defence of entrapment. The majority view in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Sorrells </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">and </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">Russell </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">has considered it to be a matter for the jury on the proper instructions of the trial judge in the ordinary way. In this process the defence leads the evidence of entrapment and the prosecution has the right of reply. The difficulties with this procedure are described above in excerpts from the minority view from the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Sorrells </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">case forward. The minority position is that abuse of process is the fundamental safeguard available to the community through the court for the preservation of the integrity of the administration of justice. It is for the courts and no one else to maintain that integrity and to keep the courts free and immune from improper employment by other branches of government. Thus the minority view decries the employment of a rule of statutory construction to find that the accused, although he has committed the crime, has not offended the statute and thereby is entitled to a defence. The minority view meets the problem head-on by acknowledging the commission of the offence but, in the circumstances raised by the defence of entrapment, treating the case as one the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 448]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">hearing of which in court would be an abuse of the judicial system by the prosecutorial arm of government. The remedy in such a case therefore is a stay of prosecution, a denial of the courts to their improper use by the law enforcement agencies of the community. Sometimes the United States courts quashed the indictment and sometimes simply entered a stay. There seems to be no distinction in the law of that country, at least in this sector of the law, between the remedy of a dismissal, quashing of indictment or indefinite stay of prosecution. The essential difference between the minority and majority is that the latter leave the issue to the jury in the ordinary way as though this were a substantive defence, whereas the minority take the view that the protection of the process of the Court and the institution of the Court in order to preserve it for the discharge of its proper role in the community is a function for the Court and the Court alone. This raises philosophical difficulties when one considers the defence of duress where of course the physical act in question has been committed. The defence is available through the ordinary processes of trial and, if a jury is involved, will include the assessment of all the evidence and circumstances by the jury to determine the success of the defence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">In the case of entrapment, the minority in the United States Supreme Court has concluded that on balance the public interest requires that the administration of justice be safeguarded against the challenge coming from the executive branch of government through the abuse of the judicial process, by the presiding judge himself without the intervention of a jury. This school of thought has in its support the need for continuity of administration of the principle. The realization of an abuse of the judicial branch is a question essentially of law or law and political science and one not by its nature ordinarily assigned to the jury component of the trial courtroom. It would seem, on a pure application of criminal procedure, that a stay is the proper judicial step. I find comfort in this</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">What basis, therefore, do we have in our criminal judicial system for a court staying a prosecution brought in the ordinary way by the executive branch of the government charged with the enforcement of the criminal law? This Court considered its role where abuse of process was advanced as a defence in <i>R. v. Osborn </i>which carne to this Court from the Ontario Court of Appeal where Jessup J.A., speaking for the Court in [1969] 1 O.R. 152, at p. 155, concluded:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... the courts of this Province have from the earliest times invoked an inherent jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of their process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">This brings us then to the basic question as to whether or not after the judgments of this Court in <i>Osborn </i>and in <i>Rourke, infra, </i>there is any jurisdiction in a Canadian criminal court to stay a prosecution on the grounds of abuse of process whether or not that abuse takes the form of the defence of entrapment. The Court of Appeal in <i>Osborn </i>was, in the result, reversed in this Court on the grounds that there is no basis in our criminal law for a finding of oppression by reason only of the fact that a multiplicity of charges are successively laid in relation to the same facts. In that case the respondent was acquitted on a charge of having in possession seven cheques intended to be used to commit a forgery. A year later the accused was indicted on a charge of conspiring to commit the indictable offence of uttering the same seven forged cheques. This was found in this Court not to be either oppressive or subject to any remedy such as abuse of process. In the view of Pigeon J. (Martland and Judson JJ. concurring), the issue was very narrow and dealt entirely with the right in the prosecution to come back with the second charge as it did. In his judgment Pigeon J. stated in part at pp. 188-89:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In reaching his conclusion Pigeon J. cited from the British decision of <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions, </span></i>[1964] <i><span style="letter-spacing:

The minority in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Osborn </span></i>simply found that the facts did not give rise to oppression and consequently it was unnecessary to determine the extent to which the doctrine of the abuse of process might be employed in our criminal courts. The Chief Justice simply agreed that the appeal should be allowed and gave no reason.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Before proceeding to an examination of the decision of this Court in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Rourke, supra, </span></i>one should examine briefly the judgments in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Connelly v.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Lord Morris, at p. 1304, narrowed the discretion somewhat by stating:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Lord Devlin, on the other hand, at p. 1347, took a much broader view of the authority of the Court to protect its own processes:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Lord Pearce adopted the broad view of Lord Devlin when he stated at p. 1365:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The court has, I think, a power to apply, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, the broader principles to cases that do not fit the actual pleas [pleas of <i>autrefois convict </i>and <i>autrefois acquit] </i>and a duty to stop a prosecution which on the facts offends against those principles and creates abuse and injustice.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Viewed in the light of the <i>Connelly </i>case, reference to which was repeatedly made in <i>Osborn, </i>it is difficult to see <i>Osborn </i>as establishing anything more than that the doctrine of abuse of prosecution will not avail an accused in a case of multiple charges brought on the same set of facts if nothing more is involved. The House of Lords continued the examination of the breadth of application, not the existence, of the doctrine of the abuse of process in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys, </i>[1976] 2 Ml E.R. 497. Lord Hailsham, at p. 517, acknowledged the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to protect its own processes against abuse. Lord Salmon also found a general discretion in the Court to stay proceedings which were vexatious or oppressive (p. 528); and Lord Edmund-Davies took the same general position (pp. 533-35):</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Notwithstanding certain of my observations in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in <i>Connelly, </i>I am now satisfied that, in the words of Lord Parker CJ in <i>Mills v Cooper </i>[[19671] 2 All ER at 104, [1967] 2 QB at 467], 'every court has undoubtedly a right in its discretion to decline to hear proceedings on the ground that they are oppressive and an abuse of the process of the court' ... .</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I turn now to the decision of this Court in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Rourke v. The Queen, </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">[1978] </span>1 S.C.R. 1021. The Court was there faced with a proceeding which at trial had been stayed by reason of the delay in the Crown said to be harmful to the defence of the accused in bringing a charge of kidnapping and robbery, some twenty months in all. Pigeon J., writing for the majority in a five-to-four division, stated at p. 1043:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I cannot find any rule in our criminal law that prosecutions must be instituted promptly and ought not to be permitted to be proceeded with if a delay in instituting them may have caused prejudice to the accused. In fact, no authority was cited to establish the existence of such a principle which is at variance with the rule that criminal offences generally are not subject <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">to prescription except in the case of specific offences for</span> which a prescription time has been established by statute. I have to disagree with the view expressed by McIntyre J.A. that there could be factual situations <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">giving to a trial judge discretion to stay proceedings for</span> delay.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As we have seen, the decision in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Osborn </span></i>was narrowed down to the facts then before the Court, namely the bringing of successive charges arising out of the same set of facts and the contrast between the criminal law procedure of Canada and the United Kingdom. Again in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Rourke </span></i>the issue is narrowly confined to the effects of a delay in bringing on to trial a person arrested twenty months previously at which time many if not all of the facts alleged by the prosecution were known.

letter-spacing:.5pt">Code. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">The last alternative (c) has a technical infirmity in that the charge remains extant and in the records of the court. The case before the Court in this appeal was founded on an information about which there is no suggestion of irregularity. However, the defect in course (c) is wholly technical. While the charge may be said to hang over the head of the accused, this is a wholly theoretical observation because there is no forum for its further processing. The courts in both the United States and the United Kingdom have in such circumstances, as shown in the authorities already reviewed, followed all three routes without apparent concern for technical considerations. I would prefer alternative (c) and would apply a stay of prosecution where the defence of entrapment is operative.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There are offences which by their very nature would appear (as indicated earlier in these reasons) to render this defence inapplicable, as for example crimes of violence. One of the questions to be answered here therefore must be, what are the offences to which this defence will relate? Generally speaking, it is the consensual offence where the issue most naturally arises. When the offence relates to physical acts the crime leaves its own marks. Methods of detection reflect this fact. The victims complain. The external evidence is there for the police to follow. In other areas of crime such as drug offences, commercial or municipal fraud, prostitution and gambling, these conditions do not prevail. The 'victims' rarely seek the aid of the authorities, and indeed generally there are no direct 'victims'. There are no external signs of the offence. Policing must react differently to this kind of crime. Hence the use of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:.5pt">agents provocateurs, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">spies, informers, undercover agents in or retained by the police force, decoys and other such police initiatives. The move from passive to active policing brings the courts into the process. When policing in this field verges into police-instigated crimes or into police stimulation of crime for the sake of obtaining convictions, what is the position of the courts? Up to this development in criminal justice the positions of the court and the executive were clear. The latter investigate apparent offences, gather evidence, make arrests,</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 458]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">lay charges, introduce evidence in court and present the law enforcement agency's views on the applicable law. The courts on the other hand receive the charge, take custody of the accused in a figurative and sometimes actual sense, hear the evidence, interpret and apply the law, determine guilt or innocence, award the appropriate punishment and return the accused to executive custody; or discharge the accused. In the process the court must concern itself with the conduct of the case by the prosecution and the accused and must vigorously apply the fundamental doctrine of the presumption of innocence. Courts have for centuries been evolving doctrines appropriate to this process, with and without legislative aid, in the form of rules relating to the admissibility of evidence and such substantive rules as the doctrine of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">res <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">judicata. </span></span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The consensual crimes, their detection and demonstration in court, raise new issues or aggravate the problems surrounding older issues. The appointed spy may, pursuant to arrangements, infiltrate and report upon participants in a crime to which the agent may be a party or which the agent has provided to others the opportunity to commit. In some circumstances, indeed, the offence would in all likelihood not have otherwise been committed. The law enforcement agency in these circumstances moves from the position of merely affording an opportunity for the commission of crime to persons who may be so disposed to a position where the agency itself encourages the commission of the crime. Expressed another way, the police may have by any such measures instigated the offence, or at least its planning, and did so simply to catch the otherwise innocent members of the public in order to prosecute them. The ensnared or entrapped must in such a situation have a defence in law for the police and the state have gone beyond mere crime detection by decoy work or solicitation of evidence. In fact the crime has been designed and committed by the state itself.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Whatever may be the range of such a defence, it must be clear that the defence arising in this circumstance does not operate in the case of all offences. In the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Model Penal Code </span></i>of 1962, <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">supra, </span></i>the defence is "unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offence charged ... " (s. 2.13(3)), presumably on the basis that the social interest in controlling the accused's behaviour outweighs that of controlling police behaviour. There may be other categories of offences to which the defence will not run but this again will develop as the judicial system of criminal justice may require.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This is not a process unknown to the common law. The defence of 'duress' arose in the common law long before the Report of the Imperial Commissioners on the Draft Code 1879, s. 12 stated: "We have framed s. 23 of our Draft Code, to express what we think is the existing law ...." The Commissioners are there referring to the defence of duress, a defence originating in the common law long before the studies for the codification of criminal law commenced in England and were completed in Canada. The parallel is particularly apt as the defence of duress relates to the completed commission of an offence in the same way as entrapment. The common law rules and principles of duress as a defence, at least as regards a principal offender, have now been "codified and exhaustively defined in s. 17 ... " of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Code (R. v. Carker, </span></i>[1967] S.C.R. 114, <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">per </span></i>Ritchie J. at p. 117). The Report by the Commissioners, <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">supra, </span></i>had this to say on the scope of that defence in common law:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">There can be no doubt that a man is entitled to preserve <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">his own life and limb; and on this ground he may justify</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">much which otherwise would be punishable. The cases</span> <span style="letter-spacing:
-.05pt">of a person setting up as a defence that he was compelled to commit a crime is of every day occurrence. </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">There is no doubt on the authorities that compulsion is a</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">defence where the crime is not of a heinous character.</span></span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The evolution of defences at common law, both evidentiary and substantive, have seen expansion and adjustment as required to meet altering conditions in the community, and entrapment as a defence has experienced this same history where it has been recognized. See for example the discussion in N.L.A. Barlow, </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Entrapment and the Common Law. Is there a Place for the American Doctrine of Entrapment, supra.</span></i></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In the Court of Appeal Seaton J.A. (with whom Carrothers J.A. concurred) expressed a preference for the "English approach" which he described as making allowance at the sentencing stage by giving "attention to what motivated him and to any influence that others had upon him; others would include the police". It is certainly true that the courts of England have rejected the defence of entrapment </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">(vide Sang, supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">at p. 1224) where not only was the defence of entrapment rejected but also the indirect power in a court to exclude evidence of the commission of the offence as a means of controlling the activities of the prosecution. In the course of giving judgment Lord Diplock (at p. 1227) and Lord Salmon (at p. 1236) both adverted to the possibility of imposing a milder sentence in the event the accused was found on the evidence to have been entrapped. However, it should be noted that both Law Lords also suggested prosecution of the police as a means of control of such improper activities. The House of Lords started with the simple assertion that entrapment is not a defence in English law and then approached the question on the basis that a power in a court to exclude the evidence relating to the commission of the offence on whatever basis would simply be a recognition of entrapment indirectly when the same was impermissible directly.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The fundamental cleavage in principle between the House and the approach of the United States Supreme Court is seen in Lord Diplock's observation at p. 1230:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">It is no part of a judge's function to exercise disciplinary</span><span lang="EN-CA"> <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt">powers over the police or prosecution as respects the way</span> in which evidence to be used at the trial is obtained by them.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">In my respectful view the issue is not the discipline of the prosecution but the avoidance of the improper invocation by the state of the judicial process and its powers in circumstances where the accused has been ensnared by the police force in order to bring about an offence for which he will be prosecuted. The view of Lord Diplock is expressed somewhat differently but with the same result by Lord Salmon at pp. 1235-36:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A man who intends to commit a crime and actually <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">commits it is guilty of the offence whether or not he has</span> been persuaded or induced to commit it, no matter by whom. This being the law, it is inconceivable that, in <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">such circumstances, the judge could have a discretion to</span> prevent the Crown from adducing evidence of the accused's guilt, for this would amount to giving the judge the power of changing or disregarding the law.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">These conclusions necessarily result from the rejection of the defence of entrapment which as a necessary consequence has the effect of fatally reducing the Court's discretion under existing law which Lord Scarman described at p. 1243 as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">it is now the law that 'a judge has a discretion to <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">exclude legally admissible evidence if justice so requires'</span> (per Lord Reid in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Myers v Director of Public Prosecu</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">tions, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">[[1964] 2 All E.R. 881 </span><span lang="EN-CA">at </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">887, [1965] A.C. 1001 </span><span lang="EN-CA">at </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">1024.]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Viscount Dilhorne was discussing the same principle in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">Selvey, </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">at p. 510 when he said:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">evidentiary sense in the course of the trial, but not necessarily resulting in an unfair outcome, the court, in its duty to ensure a fair trial, may exclude the objectionable evidence. This is the result not entirely of the adoption of the view that mitigation of sentence is the appropriate remedy alone but that legislation is necessary to recognize entrapment, that guilt is guilt however it may be proven or even brought about, that prosecution of the informer or of the police themselves is an adequate control mechanism. Some or all of these in combination may underlie the House of Lords' decision but it would appear to amount to an. oversimplification of the "English approach" to ascribe the result, at least in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Sang, supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">as the adoption of singular recourse to mitigation of sentence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The judgments in </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Sang </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">may be said to be less than usually persuasive because they suffer, in my respectful view, from being a discussion of an assumed demonstration by the accused that but for police intervention he "would not have committed the offence" without any more factual base than that as to the presence or absence of inveigling and persistent importuning, and from a precluded view on entrapment as a defence known to the law.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">There is in our country a serious limitation to reliance upon mitigation of sentence as a judicial response to the problem of entrapment. The </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal Code </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">and the <i>Narcotics Control Act, </i>and perhaps other statutes, sometimes impose serious minimum sentences. The latter statute in s. 5(2) for example, being the offence of importation of narcotics, stipulates a minimum sentence of seven years. It can hardly be thought that Parliament, in establishing such a minimum imprisonment, had in mind an accused who could demonstrate that the crime was instigated by the state itself.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">As I have already intimated, the repugnance which must be experienced by a court on being implicated in a process so outrageous and shameful on the part of the state cannot be dissipated by</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 463]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">the registration of a conviction and the imposition thereafter of even a minimum sentence. To participate in such injustice up to and including a finding of guilt and then to attempt to undo the harm by the imposition of a lighter sentence, so far from restoring confidence in the fair administration of justice, would contribute to the opposite result. For the courts to acknowledge at the sentencing stage of the trial a sense of outrage at the position in which the accused and the court have been placed at the instigation of the police, is a wholly unsatisfactory response to the realization that a flagrant abuse of the process of the court has occurred. The harm to both the accused and to the administration of justice is complete with the substantive determination of guilt.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The stay of proceedings in the presence of entrapment finds its way into the law or fails to do so as a matter of judicial view of the proper policy of the law in these circumstances. Which policy will produce a principle of law which will better serve the community in this area of the criminal law has been the subject of thought and debate for a lengthy period. The considerations at play are well known and have been thoroughly analysed and debated in the courts and by judicial writers.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In the foregoing pages I have reviewed and discussed the experience of the courts of this country, of England and of the United States in their approach to the question of entrapment. I have, as well, endeavoured to isolate and state the principles which have emerged in the cases regarding the formulation of the defence and the application of it. It is clear that the need for some element of judicial control has been recognized in the common law and that the roots of the doctrine of entrapment are to be found in the common law. I am of the view that it is open to this Court and consistent with authority to recognize a defence of entrapment and to give effect to it in proper cases.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The conduct of the investigatory authority here in my view clearly gives rise to entrapment. In a period of two and one-half months the accused received fifteen to twenty telephone calls, together with visits to the accused by the police or their agent at work or at home. These importunings</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 464]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">were accompanied by successful efforts by the agent to gain the confidence and friendship of the accused. All this occurred after he had told the police informer that the accused could not be counted upon to provide the cocaine. In the second period of contact requests for drugs were made on a daily basis and accompanied by frequent visits by the undercover policeman at the accused's place of employment. In this second period there were also numerous urgent telephone calls requesting drugs, sometimes accompanied by implied threats of physical violence. That there was persistent inveigling and importuning is clear. It is also clear that the purpose of the program initiated by the police was to obtain evidence for the prosecution of the accused. It is the plain fact that the drug trafficking which occurred was promoted by the police at a time when the police had no reason to suspect, let alone believe, that the accused was in any way related to such activity. The cumulative effect of such a deliberately launched enterprise by the police would in my view 'in all the circumstances' be viewed in the community as shocking and outrageous, and such conduct is clearly contrary to the proper principles upon which justice must be done by the courts.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">For all the reasons advanced and discussed above, I would recognize the defence of entrapment and would apply that defence to the facts and circumstances of this case; and therefore would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and direct a stay of prosecution.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The judgment of Martland, Dickson, Beetz and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:1.0pt">DICKSON </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:2.4pt">J.—I</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:1.0pt"> </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">am of the opinion that on the facts of this case the defence of entrapment, assuming it to be available under Canadian law, does not arise.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The trial judge stated:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In order to determine the sufficiency of evidence to<span style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">involved in the transaction. The instigation must of course go beyond mere solicitation or decoy work.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">He continued:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In present case, the Crown was unable to produce the <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">witness who originally arranged for the undercover offi</span>cer to meet the accused, Amato. His evidence would have been extremely useful to assist me in making my determinations of fact. He could have corroborated the <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">evidence of the Crown or he could have corroborated the</span> evidence of the Defence. I believe he should have been called by the Crown. His absence has restricted the Defence from making a full answer in defence to the charge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">The trial judge concluded that in fairness to the accused he must presume that the witness in question would have given evidence consistent with that given by the defence and for that reason the findings of fact ought to be made on the basis of the evidence tendered by the defence. It seems to me a doubtful proposition that the defence evidence must be accepted as true because the Crown failed to call a witness whom the trial judge considered should have been called. Notwithstanding the adoption of such an unusual course, the trial judge concluded:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am satisfied that the evidence in this case falls far short of the evidence required at law to establish the defence of entrapment. The evidence amounts no more than to persistent solicitation by the informer and the undercover Officer to persuade the accused Amato to engage in trafficking in cocaine.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">When the matter reached the Court of Appeal, Taggart J.A. referred to the passage from the judgment at trial which I have just quoted and said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am not persuaded that the evidence to which we have been referred by counsel for the Appellant does other than support the conclusion reached by the trial judge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">Seaton J.A., in the course of his judgment said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In the case at bar the police are not blamed, it is the informer who it is said importuned the Appellant. The police, according to counsel for the Appellant, did not have any reason to go after the Appellant and were not after him. It seems to me to follow that they did not entrap him. What the Appellant is saying is "I did</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 466]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">commit the offence, I was importuned by another, and fortunately for me that other had some relationship with the police and as a result I should be found not guilty." I do not accept that. I think that entrapment as such is not a general defect.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Carrothers, J.A. agreed with each Mr. Justice Taggart and Mr. Justice Seaton.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The four British Columbia judges before whom the matter has come have been unanimous in concluding that, on the facts, the defence of entrapment does not arise. It does not seem to me to fall to this Court to retry the case and arrive at different findings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I would therefore dismiss this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The following are the reasons delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">RITCHIE </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:1.1pt">J.—This</span><span lang="EN-CA"> is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia affirming the conviction of the appellant at his trial before Judge McGivern on two charges of trafficking in cocaine. The first charge was laid against Amato alone, but the second charge for the same offence which was allegedly committed ten days later was also laid against one June Lee.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The transactions which are the subject of these two counts formed a part of a sequence of events which was put in motion by one Don Langvin, a police informer, who had a drug related criminal record and who was employed by the police in this instance in furtherance of a scheme to locate sources from which drug traffickers were able to obtain their supply. The device adopted to this end was to instruct Langvin, who was then acting under an R.C.M.P. undercover officer named Godwin, to ferret out the required information. Langvin proceeded to obtain an introduction to the appellant through one Andre who employed Amato as a hairdresser. Langvin thereafter posed as one in need of drugs and requested the appellant to obtain some for him. Amato at first refused to have anything to do with the proposition saying in effect that he was just a simple hairdresser and</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 467]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">knew nothing about drugs in any way; however, after a series of telephone calls and visits to his place of work, Amato was persuaded by Langvin to obtain a gram of cocaine which he did by contacting his former mistress, June Lee, who appears to have had the necessary contact with drug sources and who was thus able to produce the small amount of cocaine. This first transaction forms no part of the charges against Amato but it turned out to be only the beginning of repeated pestering by Langvin seeking further drugs from Amato. Thenceforth Amato was constantly bothered by telephone calls at his home and visits at his place of business by Langvin all of which were directed to soliciting further drugs from Amato. Amato finally succumbed to the pressure being exerted on him and arranged for another delivery. It was at this point that the undercover policeman, Godwin, entered the picture; he was introduced to Amato and after more pressure had been exerted over the appellant, a meeting was arranged for delivery of a further supply of cocaine. This transaction was the subject of the first charge against the appellant but the undercover policeman there-after played a more prominent part and, posing as one who had friends coming to town the next day who were important in the drug trade in the U.S.A. and were in need of an immediate delivery of drugs which they were prepared to obtain by violence, that he finally induced the appellant to obtain a further supply of cocaine and in this case the transaction was completed by payment by Godwin to Amato and thence to Miss Lee.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It should be stressed that the record does not disclose any wrongdoing by the appellant either through dealings in drugs or otherwise until he was approached by Langvin and that his association with this character was purely as a friend of his employer (Andre). All the drug dealings involving the appellant were prompted and solicited by Langvin and later by Godwin and, as I have indicated, it is plain to me from the record that the course of events was instigated and carried forward at the direction of the police for the purpose of locating drug sources and that the involvement of the appellant was simply an incidental factor necessarily employed by the police in order to</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 468]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">achieve their objective. At the trial before McGivern J., Langvin was not called as a witness by either the Crown or the defence and as to this circumstance the learned trial judge observed:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">In the present case, the Crown was unable to produce the witness who originally arranged for the undercover officer to meet the accused, Amato. His evidence would have been extremely useful to assist me in making my determinations of fact. He could have corroborated the evidence of the Crown or he could have corroborated the evidence of the Defence. I believe he should have been called by the Crown. His absence has restricted the Defence from making a full answer in defence to the charge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am satisfied that in fairness to the accused I must presume that he would have given evidence consistent with that given by the Defence. For that reason, I am prepared for the sake of these reasons for judgment, to assume that the findings of fact ought to be made on the basis of the evidence tendered by the Defence. The accused, Amato, testified that he was induced and persuaded by his former boss and the Police informer to obtain some cocaine. After several months of requests, and in an attempt to befriend the Police informer, Amato arranged for some cocaine through the accused, Lee. He also said that he had to persuade her to go along with the deal. The second transaction took place involving a half ounce of cocaine. At this time the <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">accused, Amato, believed he was assisting his friend who</span> was a Police informer. He only wanted to help a friend, the deal was arranged. The undercover Policeman arrived on the scene and after some time Amato was persuaded to go along with the sale to the undercover Policeman rather than to his friend, the informer.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">Against the above background I am prepared to </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">adopt </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:
.3pt">the analysis of the facts contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taggart in the Court of Appeal:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Very briefly, the facts are that the Appellant was <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">asked by his then employer if he could find some cocaine</span> for a friend of his, that is to say of the employer's. The Appellant then and throughout the time that he had to do with the undercover police officer and the informer expressed no interest in accommodating them and it was only by virtue of the persuasion of his employer in the first instance and of the informer and the undercover police officer thereafter that the Appellant eventually agreed to provide a source of cocaine.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">There were three transactions, the first of which did not result in a charge being preferred against the Appel<span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">lant.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 469]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">That first offence was of a relatively small amount of cocaine which after a great deal of solicitation on the part of the informer the Appellant agreed to procure. He procured it through the medium of June Lee who herself obtained it from other persons. The first transaction was accomplished by the Appellant going to the house of Lee and there obtaining and paying for the cocaine with money which had been provided to him by the informer. He then took the cocaine to the informer <span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">and delivered it over to him. The informer in turn turned</span> it over to his contact in the police force.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">On the second occasion which gave rise to the first of the two charges against the Appellant, a substantially larger amount of cocaine was involved and the undercover police officer appeared on the scene with the informer. Substantially the same procedure was adopted on this occasion as the first occasion.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The third transaction did not involve the informer at all, but only the undercover police officer. On this occasion a yet more substantial amount of cocaine was involved and on this occasion the undercover police officer accompanied the Appellant to the house of Lee where the money was handed over and the cocaine provided directly to the undercover police officer. On <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">each of these occasions there was a considerable amount</span> of importuning on the part of either the informer or the undercover police officer or both.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">It was submitted on behalf of the appellant, both at trial and on appeal, that the above circumstances were such as to justify him in invoking the defence of entrapment if indeed such a defence is recognized in Canadian law. Both courts below, however, held that the circumstances which I have outlined did not constitute entrapment and that in any event entrapment does not constitute a defence to a criminal charge in Canada. It is these two findings which form the basis of the grounds of appeal to this Court which are described as follows in the factum filed on behalf of the appellant:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(i) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in ruling that the conduct used by the police in this case directed at instigating and procuring the commission of a criminal offence by the accused did not in law constitute an entrapment or an abuse of process?</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(ii) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in ruling that entrapment does not constitute a defence to a criminal charge?</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 470]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(iii) Whether the failure of the Crown to call the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">undercover police agent, Donald Langvin, or procure his</span> attendance at the trial restricted the accused from making a full answer and defence to the charges and thereby constituted an abuse of process for which the proceedings ought to have been stayed?</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As will hereafter appear the defence of entrapment has been recognized in a number of cases in the Supreme Court of the United States, but it is categorically denied by the courts in the United Kingdom as going to the guilt or innocence of the accused, although some consideration may be given to it in regard to sentence. This is made plain in the following passage from a judgment of Lord Chief Justice Widgery in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">R. v. Mealey and Sheridan </span></i></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">(1974), </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.5pt">60 </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Crim. App. R. 59, at p. 62, where he says that it is</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... quite clearly established that the so-called defence of entrapment, which finds some place in the law of the United States of America, finds no place in our law here. It is abundantly clear on the authorities, which are uncontradicted on this point, that if a crime is brought about by the activities of someone who can be described as an agent provocateur, although that may be an important matter in regard to sentence, it does not affect the question of guilty or not guilty.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the same case Lord Widgery observed that a policeman</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">... must endeavour to tread the somewhat difficult line between showing the necessary enthusiasm to keep his cover and actually becoming an agent provocateur, meaning thereby someone who actually causes offences to be committed which otherwise would not be committed at all.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The approach in the United States stems from a judgment of the Supreme Court <i><span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">in Sorrells v. United States </span></i>(1932), 287 U.S. 435, where an undercover police agent posing as a tourist induced a local resident to obtain liquor for him, and Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for the majority, after discussing entrapment as a defence, went on to say at p. 442:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">A different question is presented when the criminal design originates with the officials of the Government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 471]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">These observations were expressly affirmed in the Supreme Court in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Sherman v. United States </span></i>(1958), 356 U.S. 369 and in <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">United States v. Russell </span></i>(1973), 411 U.S. 423, in the latter of which cases Mr. Justice Rehnquist expanded on the reasoning for recognizing the limitations of the defence of entrapment when he said, at p. 434:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Nor does it seem particularly desirable for the law to grant complete immunity from prosecution to one who <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">himself planned to commit a crime, and then committed</span> it, simply because government undercover agents subjected him to inducements which might have seduced a hypothetical individual who was not so predisposed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The latter quotation indicates the different approaches adopted in the United States to the validity of the defence of entrapment where opportunity to commit a crime has been presented to an accused by the police.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">If it be shown that an accused's character or record was such that he might have been predisposed to committing such a crime as is alleged and that he merely took advantage of the opportunity created by the undercover organization of the police to commit the crime, he is obviously under these circumstances not entitled to rely on the defence of entrapment in the same way as one whose record and character are free of blemish and who can show that his involvement with the crime was devised through the "creative activity" of an <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">agent provocateur.</span></i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Although there is no authoritative judgment in Canada wherein it has been found that the facts support a defence of entrapment, there are nonetheless a number of cases in which the elements of such a defence are discussed. These cases are extensively reviewed by Laskin, C.J. in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Kirzner </span></i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">v. </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">to the crime being committed. In such event the essential element of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">mens rea </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">would be absent and the accused's defence would be established.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The Canadian approach to the defence is best illustrated in the case of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Kirzner, supra, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">where the Chief Justice made the following statement at p. 494:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The problem which has caused judicial concern is the<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:
-.2pt">one which arises from the police-instigated crime, where</span><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>the police have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>decoy work and have actively organized a scheme of<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to prosecute the<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> person so caught. In my opinion, it is only in this </span><span style="letter-spacing:
-.05pt">situation that it is proper to speak of entrapment and to</span><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">consider what effect this should have on the prosecution</span><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt"> </span>of a person who has thus been drawn into the commis<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">sion of an offence.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">It was contended in the present case that Amato was subjected to a threat of violence against himself if he failed to cooperate with the police plan for procuring the drug. If this had in fact been the case I am satisfied that it might well have supported a defence of entrapment, but a careful study of the evidence fails to disclose to me that there was any such threat although the police officer who was allegedly seeking drugs for some "strong arm" operators from the United States did make mention of the fact that they carried firearms and this apparently made Amato nervous.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Whether the activities of the police can be said to have amounted to the "calculated inveigling or persistent importuning" by the police mentioned by Mr. Justice Laskin (as he then was) in R. v. </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Ormerod, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[1969] 2 O.R. 230, at p. 238, must depend on the facts of each case and in the present case, although drug transactions were suggested to Amato by an </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">agent provocateur, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">this is not of itself enough to invoke the defence of entrapment or to affect the fact that Amato must have known that what he was doing was wrong.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In the case of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Lemieux v. The Queen, [1967] </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">S.C.R. 492, Lemieux was charged with breaking and entering a dwelling house where the police had secured the consent of the owner and had lured the accused into participating in the break-in. Here</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 473]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">there was </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">mens rea </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">but the accused was ultimately acquitted in this Court on the ground that the owner having consented there was no </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">actus reus. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In the course of his reasons for judgment which were delivered on behalf of this Court, Mr. Justice Judson said, at p. 496:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Had Lemieux in fact committed the offence with which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act at the solicitation of an <i>agent <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">provocateur </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">would have been irrelevant</span> </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.6pt">to</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
-.05pt">the question</span><span lang="EN-CA"> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">of his guilt or innocence. The reason that his conviction</span> cannot stand </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">is </span><span lang="EN-CA">that the jury were not properly instructed on a question vital to the issue whether any offence had been committed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">These remarks have been widely characterized as </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">obiter dicta </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">but while it is true that they were not necessary to the determination of that case, I prefer to regard them as support for the proposition that the mere fact that the crime was committed at the "solicitation" of an </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">agent provocateur </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">does not, standing alone, support a defence of entrapment.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In my view it is only where police tactics are such as to leave no room for the formation of independent criminal intent by the accused that the question of entrapment can enter into the determination of his guilt or innocence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">It was further contended in the present case that the failure of the Crown to call the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">agent provocateur, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">Langvin, as a witness resulted in the accused being unable to cross-examine him and to thus being denied the right of making full answer and defence to the charges. The appellant characterized this method of conducting the case as being an abuse of process which should have resulted in the proceedings being stayed. In my opinion, the failure to call Langvin, who was apparently unavailable to both parties, did not amount to an abuse of process; not only does the evidence not disclose any such abuse, but no such question arises in the present case because of the finding made at trial that any disadvantage to which the defence might have been subjected by the absence of Langvin did not affect the trial judge's being "prepared for the sake of these reasons for judgment, to assume that the findings of fact ought to</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
12.0pt"> 474]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">be made on the basis of the evidence tendered by the Defence". This finding in my view mitigates against any conclusion that Langvin's absence from the stand can be characterized as having resulted in any disadvantage to the accused which could justify a finding of "abuse of process" with an accompanying stay of proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">For all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Disposition"><span lang="EN-CA">Appeal dismissed, </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">LASKIN </span><span lang="EN-CA">C.J. and </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">ESTEY, MCINTYRE </span><span lang="EN-CA">and </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">LAMER M. </span><span lang="EN-CA">dissenting.</span></p>
