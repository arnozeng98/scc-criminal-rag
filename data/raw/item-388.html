He admitted forcing the complainant to have sexual intercourse with him and stated that his drunkenness caused the attack on her. The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from conviction.

A specific intent offence is one which involves the performance of the <i>actus reus</i> coupled with an intent or purpose going beyond the mere performance of the questioned act. The distinction, which is neither artificial nor based on a legal fiction, is not divorced from logical underpinnings.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drunkenness in a general sense is not a true defence to a criminal act. The defence, however, may apply in a specific intent offence when the accused is so intoxicated that he lacks the capacity to form the specific intent required to commit the crime. The defence does not apply in offences of general intent.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elements of a charge under s. 246.2(<i>c</i>) are an assault which, objectively viewed, is of a sexual nature as a consequence of which the complainant has suffered bodily injury. The requisite mental element is only the intention to commit the assault. The surrounding circumstances are to be considered for evidence of its sexual nature and of the resulting bodily harm. The resulting interference with the physical integrity of the complainant aggravates the seriousness of a sexual assault but the mental element remains the same.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown must still prove the <i>mens rea</i> in a general intent offence, notwithstanding the absence of a defence of voluntary intoxication. This can be proved in two ways. Firstly, the <i>mens rea</i> in most cases can be inferred from the <i>actus reus</i> itself: a person is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his actions. Secondly, where the accused was so intoxicated as to raise doubt as to the voluntary nature of his conduct, the Crown may establish the necessary blameworthy mental state of the accused by proving voluntary self‑induced intoxication.

(dissenting): Evidence of self‑induced intoxication should be considered by the trier of fact, along with all other relevant evidence, in determining whether the <i>mens rea</i> required to constitute the offence has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Intoxication, to the extent that it merely lowers inhibitions, removes self‑restraint or induces unusual self‑confidence or aggressiveness, does not relate to the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for volitional and intentional or reckless conduct. Similarly, intoxication would be of no avail to an accused who got drunk in order to gain the courage to commit a crime or to aid in his defence. Juries are quite able to weigh all the evidence in a fair and responsible manner and are unlikely to acquit too readily those who have committed offences while intoxicated.</span></p>

Firstly, Parliament, not the courts, should alter the law if it is to be done in the name of policy over principle. Secondly, even if it were appropriate for the courts to do so, there is no evidence that the artificiality of the specific intent requirement is actually required for social protection.</span></p>

An honest but unreasonable mistaken belief in consent negates the <i>mens rea</i> required for some crimes. The jury's task in determining whether or not the belief was honestly held is unnecessarily complicated by the <i>Leary</i> qualification concerning mistake of fact. The uncertainty caused by <i>Leary</i> also undermines the clarity and certainty in law which underpin the principle of <i>stare decisis</i>. The classification of offences as to specific intent category is an <i>ad hoc</i>, unpredictable exercise. Finally, the courts should not create new offences or broaden the net of liability. The <i>Leary</i> rule expands the scope of criminal liability beyond normal limits. It is acceptable, however, to overrule a prior decision to establish a rule favourable to the accused.</span></p>

There was evidence that the appellant had punched the complainant twice with a closed fist, once above the eye, causing the eyelid to bleed profusely, and that he had threatened to kill her. There was evidence of a blood‑stained towel and pillow case concealed in the toilet tank of the appellant's apartment. Counsel for the appellant admitted that intercourse had taken place.</span></p>

He did not testify at the trial, but the Crown led evidence of a statement he had made to the police. In the statement he admitted that he had forced the complainant to have sexual intercourse with him. He stated that he did not know why he had done it because he was drunk and that, "when I realized what I was doing, I got off." In charging the jury, the trial judge made no reference to the intent requirement, beyond reading the jury the definition of assault. The jury was told that the sole issue was whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant had not consented to the intercourse because of the assault and threats made by the accused. With respect to drunkenness, the trial judge said as follows: "Only the accused in his statement says, `I was all drunked up too.' There was no evidence of drunkenness except that statement and it is open to you to accept it and find that he was drunk but even if he was drunk, drunkenness is no defence to the charge alleged against this accused."</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29, Pigeon J. for the majority of the Court, held that rape was an offence requiring proof of only "basic" or "general" intent rather than "specific" intent. Under that categorization, the Court held, the jury should be instructed that evidence that drunkenness may have deprived the accused of the capacity to form the requisite intent should not be taken into account when considering whether the Crown had satisfied the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had acted with the requisite intent. (See also <i>Swietlinski v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956, dealing with the offence of indecent assault). The offence of rape has now been removed from the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and in its place are the sexual assault provisions. More recently, in <i>R. v. Chase</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, the Court held that sexual assault was a crime of "basic" or "general" intent. In <i>Chase</i>, however, drunkenness was not in issue and the propriety of maintaining the distinction between general and specific intent for purposes of evidence regarding intoxication was not considered. The present case raises that much more basic issue which, in my view, the Court should reconsider.</span></p>

Analysis of the <i>Leary</i> dissent may be summarized as follows.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Courier;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

To warrant the condemnation of a conviction and the infliction of punishment, one who has caused harm must have done so with a blameworthy state of mind. It is always for the Crown to prove the existence of a guilty mind beyond a reasonable doubt. Intoxication affects one's mental state, one's ability to perceive the circumstances in which one acts, and to appreciate possible consequences. In principle, therefore, intoxication is relevant to the mental element in crime, and should be considered, together with all other evidence, in determining whether the Crown has proved the requisite mental state beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

While this expression is commonly used, it is misleading and perhaps even unduly emotive. It suggests that those who would otherwise be liable for their criminal conduct will escape because they were drunk at the time the offence was committed. But, of course, no one suggests that special concessions should be made to drunken offenders. The issue is really whether the Crown should be relieved of the usual burden of proving the requisite mental element for the offence because the accused was intoxicated. Should the jury be entitled to assess all of the evidence relevant to intent and be entitled to decide on the basis of all of the evidence whether the Crown has satisfied that burden?</span></p>

This Court, in <i>Swietlinski</i>, has recognized that intoxication may as a matter of fact deprive an accused of "basic" or "general" intent. It is said, however, by those who support the classification that as a matter of policy, consideration of evidence of intoxication must be excluded. Indeed, a notable feature to be found in the analysis of many of those who support restricting the jury's use of evidence relating to drunkenness is the concession that while principle and logic lead in an opposite direction, the policy of protection of the public requires that principle and logic should yield: see, e.g., <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Majewski</i>, [1976] 2 All E.R. 142, at pp. 167‑68, <i>per</i> Lord Edmund‑Davies, quoted by Pigeon J. in <i>Leary</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 52‑53.</span></p>

First, if the law is to be altered in the name of policy over principle, that is surely a task for Parliament rather than the courts. As Barwick C.J. of the High Court of Australia concluded in <i>O'Connor</i> (1980), 4 A. Crim. R. 348, at pp.&nbsp;363‑64:</span></p>

The offence of being drunk and disorderly is not maintained these days in all systems of the common law. In any case it has not carried a sufficient penalty properly to express the public opprobrium which should attach to one who, by the taking of alcohol or the use of drugs, has become intoxicated to the point where he is the vehicle for unsocial or violent behaviour. But, though blameworthy for becoming intoxicated, I can see no ground for presuming his acts to be voluntary and relevantly intentional. For what is blameworthy there should be an appropriate criminal offence. But it is not for the judges to create an offence appropriate in the circumstances: cf. <i>Knuller (Publishing, Printing &amp; Promotions) Ltd. v. D.P.P.</i>, [1973] A.C. 435, at pp. 457‑458, 464‑465 and 490). It must be for the Parliament.</span></p>

There are several reasons for this. To the extent that intoxication merely lowers inhibitions, removes self‑restraint or induces unusual self‑confidence or aggressiveness, it would be of no avail to an accused, as such effects do not relate to the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for volitional and intentional or reckless conduct. Similarly, intoxication would be of no avail to an accused who got drunk in order to gain the courage to commit a crime or to aid in his defence. Thirdly, one can trust in the good sense of the jury and that of our trial judges to weigh all the evidence in a fair and responsible manner, and they are unlikely to acquit too readily those who have committed offences while intoxicated.</span></p>

The use of this adjective has of recent years been often criticised as suggesting the existence of a distinction between the Crown's burden in those cases when the general intent involved in proof of mens rea is necessary, on the one hand, and in those when the statute prescribes a particular intent on the other. But we cannot accept that Lord Birkenhead intended any such distinction. He also said:</span></p>

It is true that in such cases the specific intent must be proved to constitute the particular crime, but this is, on ultimate analysis, only in accordance with the ordinary law applicable to crime, for, speaking generally (and apart from certain special offences), a person cannot be convicted of a crime unless the mens was rea. Drunkenness, rendering a person incapable of the intent, would be an answer, as it is for example in a charge of attempted suicide" (ibid., 504).</span></p>

More importantly, there was no evidence before the House of Lords in 1976 in <i>Majewski</i> or before this Honourable Court in 1970 in <i>Perrault</i> and in 1977 in <i>Leary</i> to the effect that the pre‑existing common law was not functioning properly in this area.</span></p>

I may say at once that I have, of course, no experience of English juries: but I have of juries in New South Wales. Starke J., a most experienced judge in the hearing of criminal charges in Victoria, having had as well a long and distinguished career as an advocate, expressed himself in the present case in relation to the impact of evidence of intoxication upon Victorian jurors. He said:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">"I, of course, have no knowledge of how English juries react. But over nearly forty years' experience in this State I have found juries to be very slow to accept a defence based on intoxication. I do not share the fear held by many in England that if intoxication is accepted as a defence as far as general intent is concerned the floodgates will open and hordes of guilty men will descend on the community."</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">I share his views, as if they had been expressed about jurors in New South Wales. In my opinion, properly instructed jurors would be scrupulous and not indulgent in deciding an issue of voluntariness or of intention.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">This section, in my view, does not change the law as applied in <i>Pappajohn</i>. It does not require that the mistaken belief be reasonable or reasonably held. It simply makes it clear that in determining the issue of the honesty of the asserted belief, the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the belief are relevant factors for the jury's consideration. This approach was, I suggest, foreshadowed in <i>Pappajohn</i> by Dickson J., at pp.&nbsp;155‑56, where he said:</span></p>

The ongoing debate in the courts and learned journals as to whether mistake must be reasonable is conceptually important in the orderly development of the criminal law, but in my view, practically unimportant because the accused's statement that he was mistaken is not likely to be believed unless the mistake is, to the jury, reasonable. The jury will be concerned to consider the reasonableness of any grounds found, or asserted to be available, to support the defence of mistake. Although "reasonable grounds" is not a precondition to the availability of a plea of honest belief in consent, those grounds determine the weight to be given the defence. The reasonableness, or otherwise, of the accused's belief is only evidence for, or against, the view that the belief was actually held and the intent was, therefore, lacking.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">The notion that a court should not find a person guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has a blameworthy state of mind is common to all civilized penal systems. It is founded upon respect for the person and for the freedom of human will. A person is accountable for what he wills. When, in the exercise of the power of free choice, a member of society chooses to engage in harmful or otherwise undesirable conduct proscribed by the criminal law, he must accept the sanctions which that law has provided for the purpose of discouraging such conduct. Justice demands no less. But, to be criminal, the wrongdoing must have been consciously committed. To subject the offender to punishment, a mental element as well as a physical element is an essential concomitant of the crime. The mental state basic to criminal liability consists in most crimes in either (a) an intention to cause the <i>actus reus</i> of the crime, <i>i.e.</i> an intention to do the act which constitutes the crime in question, or (b) foresight or realization on the part of the person that his conduct will probably cause or may cause the <i>actus reus</i>, together with assumption of or indifference to a risk, which in all of the circumstances is substantial or unjustifiable. This latter mental element is sometimes characterized as recklessness.</span></p>

If the constitutional guarantee empowers the court to strike down legislation as in the two cases cited above, surely it provides a sufficient basis for overruling a prior decision of the Court which fails to respect constitutionally entrenched values.</span></p>

While the protection of the public, said to underlie the <i>Leary</i> rule, could serve as an important objective, in my view the <i>Leary</i> rule does not achieve that objective in a manner consistent with the proportionality test of <i>Oakes</i>, <i>supra</i>. <i>Oakes</i> requires that "the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question." As I have noted, there is no agreement in the case law as to how to distinguish between crimes of "general intent" and crimes of "specific intent". This distinction was plainly not in the minds of the <i>Code</i> drafters, and the mental elements of many crimes are not readily classified into one category or the other. There is no rational reason for protecting the public against some drunken offenders but not against others, particularly where the distinction is not based upon the gravity of the offence or the availability of included offences. If the public protection does require special measures, that should be accomplished through comprehensive legislation rather than <i>ad hoc</i> judicial re‑casting of some offences. For a recent review of possible legislative schemes, see Quigley, "Reform of the Intoxication Defence" (1987), 33 <i>McGill L.J</i>. 1.</span></p>

Punishment acts as a deterrent where the conduct is intended or foreseen. There is no evidence to support the assertion that the <i>Leary</i> rule deters the commission of unintended crimes. Hence, there is no warrant for violating fundamental principles and convicting those who would otherwise escape criminal liability.</span></p>

In general intent offences, the jury is to be instructed to excise from their minds any evidence of drunkenness with the result that the Crown, because the accused is intoxicated, is relieved of proving <i>mens rea</i>, thereby placing the intoxicated person in a worse position than a sober person. Alternatively, the jury is required to examine the mental state of the accused, without reference to the alcohol ingested, and consequently find a fictional intent. In my view, imposition of this form of absolute liability goes well beyond what is required to protect the public from drunken offenders. As I have already indicated, striking down the artificial rule which precludes the trier of fact from considering evidence of intoxication in relation to <i>mens rea</i> has not produced an increase in the threat to public safety from drunken offenders in Australia, and there is no evidence to suggest that it would do so in Canada.</span></p>

The Court has consistently held that an honest but unreasonable mistaken belief in consent will negate the <i>mens rea</i> required for rape, indecent assault or sexual assault: see <i>Pappajohn v.

Lower courts have held that in the light of <i>Leary</i>, where intoxication is a factor in inducing a mistaken belief in consent, the jury must be instructed that while an honest but unreasonable belief will negate <i>mens rea</i> (<i>Pappajohn</i>) they are to disregard the affect that intoxication might have had in inducing that mistake (<i>Leary</i>). In <i>R. v. Moreau</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 386‑87, Martin J.A. described the task of the jury as follows:</span></p>

Where an issue arises on the evidence as to the accused's honest belief in consent, the defence of honest belief in consent must be put to the jury, notwithstanding the accused's self‑induced intoxication. There may be a basis in the evidence for the accused's honest belief in consent apart altogether from his intoxication; there may even be reasonable grounds for that belief even though he was intoxicated. The intoxication may not be the cause of the mistaken belief. However, the accused cannot rely on his self‑induced intoxication as the basis for his belief that the complainant consented. As Mayrand J.A. said in <i>R. v. Bresse, Vallières and Theberge</i> (1978), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 78 at p. 87, 7 C.R. (3d) 50 (Que. C.A.):</span></p>

The test is not whether a reasonable and sober person would have made the same mistake but whether <i>the accused</i> would have made the same mistake if he had been sober; see Glanville Williams, <i>Textbook on Criminal Law</i>, 2nd ed. (1983) at pp. 481‑2. However, to hold that evidence of self‑induced intoxication is relevant to the honesty of the accused's belief in consent where his belief is founded on his mistaken appreciation, due to intoxication, of the facts relating to the complainant's consent is, in my view, incompatible with the rule laid down in <i>Leary</i>, and would completely negate the policy rule that self‑induced intoxication is not a defence in crimes of general intent.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two judgments are clearly inconsistent. <i>Pappajohn</i> confirms the essential requirement of a subjective mental culpability as a prerequisite to criminal liability. <i>Leary</i> creates a fundamental exception to that requirement. The facts of <i>Pappajohn</i> show that the judgments will inevitably come into conflict. The Supreme Court of Canada chose to avoid dealing with the conflict in <i>Pappajohn</i> by ignoring the evidence of drinking by the accused. It is to be hoped that in a later case the Court will seek a more positive resolution to the problem. In seeking that resolution the majority position in <i>O'Connor</i> deserves emulation. After reading the opinions expressed in <i>O'Connor</i>, one concludes, as did the minority in <i>Leary</i>, that the position taken in <i>Majewski</i> and adopted by the majority in <i>Leary</i> constitutes an illogical, unwarranted, and detrimental departure from the contemporary trend in criminal law which recognizes subjective mental blameworthiness at the time of the doing of the prohibited act as the <i>sine qua non</i> of criminal liability. The creation of exceptions to the principle compelled by considerations of public policy must be left to Parliament.</span></p>

Hernandez</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228, on the ground that continued recognition of the <i>persona designata</i> category could only have the effect of creating doubt as to which procedure a party should follow. The prior decision itself was a cause of uncertainty, and therefore following the prior decision because of <i>stare decisis</i> would be contrary to the underlying value behind that doctrine, namely, clarity and certainty in the law. Similarly, in <i>Vetrovec</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Court overruled previous decisions relating to corroboration and stated, "The law of corroboration is unduly and unnecessarily complex and technical".</span></p>

I suggest that the distinction between "general" and "specific" intent which <i>Leary</i> mandates and the notorious difficulty in articulating a clear and workable definition of specific intent falls squarely within the principle enunciated in <i>Ranville</i> and <i>Vetrovec</i>. Because that category is based on policy rather than principle, classification of offences as falling within or without the specific intent category is necessarily an <i>ad hoc</i>, unpredictable exercise.</span></p>

Quin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 825, provides an example. In <i>R. v. Campbell</i> (1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 320 (Ont. C.A.), the accused was charged with breaking and entering with intent pursuant to s. 306(1)(<i>a</i>). The Ontario Court of Appeal held that offence to be a crime of specific intent and hence drunkenness was relevant to the issue of intention. In <i>Quin</i>, the accused was charged with breaking and entering and committing an indictable offence pursuant to s. 306(1)(<i>b</i>). The same court held that under that subsection, the break and enter offence was one requiring only proof of general intent and hence evidence of intoxication could not be considered. A legal category which creates distinctions of this kind, in my view, complicates and confuses the law to an unacceptable degree and, absent some compelling need for its retention, should be abandoned.</span></p>

In that case, the accused was charged with murder pursuant to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec213" target="_blank">s. 213<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>d</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. The enumerated offence the accused was alleged to have committed was indecent assault. <i>Leary</i> had held that rape was an offence of general intent and in <i>Swietlinski</i>, the Court applied <i>Leary</i> to the offence of indecent assault. However, because of the constructive murder provision, this would have led to a situation where the accused would be convicted of murder without any criminal intent. To avoid that result, the Court held that where indecent assault formed the ingredient of constructive murder pursuant to s. 213, evidence of drunkenness could be taken into account in determining whether in fact the accused had the requisite intent for the offence of indecent assault. In other words, the Court held quite explicitly that intoxication did logically bear upon the issue of intent to commit indecent assault, and that the only issue was whether, as a matter of policy, the jury should be told to put that evidence out of mind. In the light of <i>Vaillancourt</i>, <i>Swietlinski</i> is no longer significant for its result. Indeed, <i>Vaillancourt</i> and <i>Swietlinski</i> have this in common: both cases demonstrate the Court's aversion to the imposition of liability without <i>mens rea</i>. In my view, to hold that evidence of intoxication can be taken into account with reference to an offence for certain purposes but not for other purposes is further reflection of the confusion, uncertainty, and lack of principle which motivates the specific/general intent dichotomy.</span></p>

Respect for the principle of certainty and the institutional limits imposed upon the law‑making function of the courts should constrain the Court from overruling a prior decision where the effect would be to expand criminal liability. It is not for the courts to create new offences, or to broaden the net of liability, particularly as changes in the law through judicial decision operate retrospectively. The same argument does not apply, however, where the result of overruling a prior decision is to establish a rule favourable to the accused. In my submission, this principle underlies the decision of the Court in <i>Paquette v. The Queen</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 197, where the Court overruled its previous decision in <i>Dunbar v. The King</i>, <i>supra</i>, which had held that an accused who was a party to murder, but who had not himself committed the act, could not rely upon the defence of duress. (See also <i>R. v. Santeramo</i> (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 35 (Ont.

The facts giving rise to the charge have been set out by the Chief Justice and I need not make extensive reference to them. It will suffice to say that the twenty‑four‑year‑old appellant committed the sexual assault upon the eighteen‑year‑old complainant in his apartment. It was conceded that intercourse had taken place without the consent of the complainant. During the course of the assault, the appellant punched her, caused an injury to her eye, and threatened to kill her. He was convicted at trial before judge and jury. He gave no evidence but his statement to the police, admitting that he had forced the complainant to have intercourse, was put in evidence. The trial judge told the jury that the sole issue before them was that of consent. On the question of drunkenness, he said:</span></p>

It is now reported at (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 574. The Court of Appeal held that the offence of causing bodily harm was an offence of general intent to which the defence of drunkenness did not apply. In this, they followed <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Majewski</i>, [1977] A.C. 443 (H.L.), and their disposition of the case is consistent with <i>Leary v. The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29.</span></p>

The first is whether sexual assault causing bodily harm (<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, s. 246.2(<i>c</i>)) is an offence requiring proof of specific or of general intent, and the second is whether evidence of self‑induced drunkenness is relevant to the issue of guilt or innocence in an offence of general intent. Before dealing in detail with these questions, it will be helpful to make certain observations.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Courier;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

This distinction forms the basis of the defence of drunkenness and it must be understood and kept in mind in approaching this case. In <i>R. v. George</i>, [1960] S.C.R. 871, Fauteux J. said, at p.&nbsp;877:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In considering the question of <i>mens rea</i>, a distinction is to be made between (i) intention as applied to acts considered in relation to their purposes and (ii) intention as applied to acts considered apart from their purposes. A general intent attending the commission of an act is, in some cases, the only intent required to constitute the crime while, in others, there must be, in addition to that general intent, a specific intent attending the purpose for the commission of the act.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">This statement makes the distinction clear. The general intent offence is one in which the only intent involved relates solely to the performance of the act in question with no further ulterior intent or purpose. The minimal intent to apply force in the offence of common assault affords an example. A specific intent offence is one which involves the performance of the <i>actus reus</i>, coupled with an intent or purpose going beyond the mere performance of the questioned act. Striking a blow or administering poison with the intent to kill, or assault with intent to maim or wound, are examples of such offences.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

There is a world of difference between the man who in frustration or anger strikes out at his neighbour in a public house with no particular purpose or intent in mind, other than to perform the act of striking, and the man who strikes a similar blow with intent to cause death or injury. This difference is best illustrated by a consideration of the relationship between murder and manslaughter. He who kills intending to kill or cause bodily harm is guilty of murder, whereas he who has killed by the same act without such intent is convicted of manslaughter. The proof of the specific intent, that is, to kill or to cause bodily harm, is necessary in murder because the crime of murder is incomplete without it. No such intent is required, however, for the offence of manslaughter because it forms no part of the offence, manslaughter simply being an unlawful killing without the intent required for murder. The relevance of intoxication which could deprive an accused of the capacity to form the necessary specific intent in murder and its irrelevance in the crime of manslaughter can readily be seen.</span></p>

Beard</i>, [1920] A.C. 479 (H.L.), discussed and adapted in other United Kingdom cases, including <i>Attorney‑General for Northern Ireland v. Gallagher</i>, [1961] 3 All E.R. 299 (H.L.); <i>Bratty v. Attorney‑General for Northern Ireland</i>, [1961] 3 All E.R. 523 (H.L.), and <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Majewski</i>, <i>supra. </i>In this Court, the matter has been dealt with in <i>R. v. George</i>, <i>supra</i>, and other cases, but particularly in <i>Leary v. The Queen</i>, <i>supra</i>, where Pigeon J., speaking for the majority of the Court, said, at p. 57, that rape is a crime of general intention as distinguished from specific intention, a crime therefore "in which the defence of drunkenness can have no application". This may be said to have confirmed the law as it stands in Canada on this question and the appellant's principal attack in this Court is upon that decision. It is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to review in detail the authorities in this Court on the question. It will be sufficient to summarize their effect in the following terms. Drunkenness in a general sense is not a true defence to a criminal act. Where, however, in a case which involves a crime of specific intent, the accused is so affected by intoxication that he lacks the capacity to form the specific intent required to commit the crime charged it may apply. The defence, however, has no application in offences of general intent.</span></p>

It is said, firstly, that the distinction between the general intent and specific intent offences is artificial and is little more than a legal fiction. Secondly, it is said that it is illogical, because it envisages a defence of drunkenness in certain situations and not in others; it is merely a policy decision made by judges and not based on principle or logic. It will be evident from what I have said that I reject the first ground of criticism. As to the second criticism that it is based upon grounds of policy, I would say that there can be no doubt that considerations of policy are involved in this distinction. Indeed, in some cases, principally <i>Majewski</i>, <i>supra</i>, the distinction has been defended on the basis that it is sound social policy. The fact, however, that considerations of policy have influenced the development of the law in this field cannot, in my view, be condemned. In the final analysis all law should be based upon and consistent with sound social policy. No good law can be inconsistent with or depart from sound policy.</span></p>

Furthermore, the existing law is not divorced from logical underpinnings as suggested in some academic writings. Not all the academic literature has been critical. A strong statement in support of the law on utilitarian or policy grounds made shortly after <i>Majewski</i> is by Sir Rupert Cross in "Blackstone v. Bentham" (1976), 92 <i>L.Q.R</i>. 516, where he said, at pp.&nbsp;525‑26:</span></p>

Why should the requirement that intention or recklessness must be proved in order to establish liability for an assault not be subject to what appears to be the wholly reasonable retributive principle that it is unjust to those who remain sober to allow those who become drunk to allege that they were unaware of consequences of their bodily movements of which all sober people would have been aware? This is what Blackstone meant when he said that the law would not suffer any man "to privilege one crime by another."</span></p>

But the evil of inflicting punishment is justified if the harm which is thus avoided is greater than that caused by the punishment. It may be asceticism to blame people for simply getting drunk, but it is sound utilitarianism to seek to prevent people from doing certain kinds of harm while they are drunk. In so far as this object can be achieved by punishment, it is achieved most economically by singling out for punishment those who commit the kind of harm which the law seeks to prevent while they are drunk.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">Moreover, it is hardly appropriate to regard a defence of acute intoxication as a simple denial of<i> mens rea</i>; it has been suggested that defences should not be classified solely according to the effect of the accused's condition, without reference to their cause. The criminal law permits reason to override the logical application of the traditional doctrines in cases of deliberately self‑induced incapacities; to do otherwise would be tantamount to allowing a fraud on the law. It is submitted that, if the law provides no other means of imposing criminal liability in the cases of "voluntarily‑induced" incapacities discussed in this article, then there are sufficient reasons for restricting the scope of the defences as the English judges have done.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the foregoing discussion shows that there are "legally adequate criteria" for distinguishing crimes of specific intent from other crimes. As regards consequences, the agent must actually intend (and not merely be reckless in regard to) some consequences which amounts to an <i>actus reus</i>. As regards circumstances, the agent must intend his action to take place in those circumstances, or he must intend to disregard those circumstances, or he must have some further intention in respect of those circumstances, depending on the nature of the particular offence. Simple recklessness (excluding the possible complexity of "malice aforethought") does not suffice for specific intent. Where such actual intentions as we have mentioned are required for a crime to have been committed, voluntary intoxication is a defence by the <i>Majewski</i> rule.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the only choice is between liability or immunity where a requisite mental element is absent due to culpable intoxication, there must at least be some sympathy for the approach which the courts have taken. Even the most stringent critics of the intoxication rules have been wary of suggesting that no penal consequences should follow. Their preference has generally been the creation of a special offence of dangerous intoxication which would require legislative initiative. Would it be proper for the courts to encourage the legislatures to action by abandoning the present intoxication rules and insisting upon the contemporaneity of the culpable state of mind and the prohibited conduct? At stake here are theories of the judicial role which lie beyond the scope of this article. It is, however, concluded that one good reason for judicial activism‑‑the irrationality of present law‑‑does not apply to the intoxication defence.</span></p>

It is not questioned in this case that the defence of drunkenness, as it applies to specific intent offences, is supportable. It is submitted, however, that it should be extended to include all criminal charges. It is my view that this proposition is not sustainable.</span></p>

In <i>Swietlinski v.

The indecent character of the assault was to be judged upon an objective view of the facts and not upon the mental state of the accused. It was said, at p.&nbsp;968:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">What acts are indecent and what circumstances will have that character are questions of fact that will have to be decided in each case, but the determination of those questions will depend upon an objective view of the facts and circumstances in relation to the actual assault, and not upon the mental state of the accused.</span></p>

The test to be applied in determining whether the impugned conduct has the requisite sexual nature is an objective one: "Viewed in the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the assault visible to a reasonable observer"....</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">The intent or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in considering whether the conduct is sexual. If the motive of the accused is sexual gratification, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence, it may be a factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual. It must be emphasized, however, that the existence of such a motive is simply one of many factors to be considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the circumstances.</span></p>

This is consistent with the approach adopted by this Court in cases such as <i>Leary v. The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29, and <i>Swietlinski v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956, where it was held that rape and indecent assault were offences of general intent. I am unable to see any reason why the same approach should not be taken with respect to sexual assault. The factors which could motivate sexual assault are said to be many and varied (see C. Boyle, <i>Sexual Assault</i> (1984), at p. 74). To put upon the Crown the burden of proving a specific intent would go a long way toward defeating the obvious purpose of the enactment. Moreover, there are strong reasons in social policy which would support this view. To import an added element of specific intent in such offences, would be to hamper unreasonably the enforcement process. It would open the question of the defence of drunkenness, one which has always been related to the capacity to form a specific intent and which has generally been excluded by law and policy from offences requiring only the minimal intent to apply force (see <i>R. v. Bernard</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 574 (Ont. C.A., <i>per</i> Dubin J.A.)) For these reasons, I would say that the offence will be one of general rather than specific intent.</span></p>

As already mentioned, nobody has suggested that it should not apply in cases of specific intent. The Chief Justice has expressed the view that evidence of self‑induced intoxication should be a relevant consideration in determining whether the <i>mens rea</i> of any particular offence has been proved by the Crown. As I have indicated, I am unable to agree with this conclusion. The effect of such a conclusion would be that the more drunk a person becomes by his own voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs, the more extended will be his opportunity for a successful defence against conviction for the offences caused by such drinking, regardless of the nature of the intent required for those offences.</span></p>

I would say at the outset that in crimes of general intent the Crown is not relieved from proving any element of the offence. The effect of excluding the drunkenness defence from such offences is merely to prevent the accused from relying on his self‑imposed drunkenness as a factor showing an absence of any necessary intent. While this Court has consistently recognized the basic proposition that an accused person should not be subject to criminal sanction unless the Crown shows the existence of a blameworthy or criminal mental state associated with the <i>actus reus</i> of the crime, it does not follow that a person who so deprives himself by the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug of the normal power of self‑restraint that a crime results, should be entitled to an acquittal. Compelling reasons grounded in logic, common sense, and sound social policy dictate otherwise.</span></p>

It is clear from a review of the cases, however, that until the early years of the nineteenth century drunkenness was considered "rather an aggravation than a defence": see Lord Birkenhead in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 494. The early principle of the common law was that a voluntary destruction of will power would entitle a person to no more favourable treatment with regard to criminal conduct than a sober person. By the latter part of the nineteenth century this earlier rule was "mercifully relaxed" (see Lawton L.J. in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Majewski</i>, [1975] 3 All E.R. 296 (C.A.), at p. 305) in respect of crimes of specific intent where the capacity to form the required specific intent was not present because of intoxication: see the early cases such as <i>R. v. Doherty</i> (1887), 16 Cox. C.C. 306, <i>per</i> Stephen J., at p. 308. This new approach was given approval in <i>Beard</i>'s case and the more modern authorities have been based upon it. This relaxation stems no doubt from a recognition of the severity of the penal consequence of most of the specific intent offences, as compared with the generally lesser penalties associated with the general intent offences. Therefore, the exclusion of the defence from general intent offences was not an exception to the general rule. The exception was the allowance of the defence in specific intent cases adopted to recognize the more complicated mental processes required for the crimes of special intent and the greater penalties involved. Some measure of relief for such cases was therefore provided. Otherwise, the common law preserved the general rule that a person may not by voluntary intoxication render himself immune from the consequences of his conduct.</span></p>

The accused had been acquitted of a charge of robbery with violence on the ground that, because of drunkenness, he was incapable of forming the specific intent to commit robbery. The trial judge did not consider the question of common assault. After stating that no specific intent is necessary to constitute the offence of common assault, Fauteux J.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In considering the question of <i>mens rea</i>, a distinction is to be drawn between "intention" as applied to acts done to achieve an immediate end on the one hand and acts done with the specific and ulterior motive and intention of furthering or achieving an illegal object on the other hand. Illegal acts of the former kind are done "intentionally" in the sense that they are not done by accident or through honest mistake, but acts of the latter kind are the product of preconception and are deliberate steps taken towards an illegal goal. The former acts may be the purely physical products of momentary passion, whereas the latter involve the mental process of formulating a specific intent. A man, far advanced in drink, may intentionally strike his fellow in the former sense at a time when his mind is so befogged with liquor as to be unable to formulate a specific intent in the latter sense. The offence of robbery, as defined by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, requires the presence of the kind of intent and purpose specified in ss. 269 and 288, but the use of the word "intentionally" in defining "common assault" in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec230" target="_blank">s. 230<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is exclusively referable to the physical act of applying force to the person of another.</span></p>

Under these circumstances, evidence that the accused was in a state of voluntary drunkenness cannot be treated as a defence to a charge of common assault because there is no suggestion that the drink which had been consumed had produced permanent or temporary insanity and the respondent's own statement indicates that he knew that he was applying force to the person of another.</span></p>

Lord Elwyn Jones L.C. (Diplock, Simon, Kilbrandon Ll.J. concurring) cited a speech by Lord Simon in <i>R. v.

His course of conduct in reducing himself by drugs and drink to that condition in my view supplies the evidence of mens rea, of guilty mind certainly sufficient for crimes of basic intent. It is a reckless course of conduct and recklessness is enough to constitute the necessary mens rea in assault cases: see <i>Reg</i>. v. <i>Venna</i>, [1976] Q.B. 421, <i>per</i> James L.J. at p. 429. The drunkenness is itself an intrinsic, an integral part of the crime, the other part being the evidence of the unlawful use of force against the victim. Together they add up to criminal recklessness. On this I adopt the conclusion of Stroud in 1920, 36 L.Q.R. 273 that:</span></p>

By allowing himself to get drunk, and thereby putting himself in such a condition as to be no longer amenable to the law's commands, a man shows such regardlessness as amounts to mens rea for the purpose of all ordinary crimes."</span></p>

It may well be that Parliament will at some future time consider, as I think it should, the recommendation in the Butler Committee Report on Mentally Abnormal Offenders (Cmnd. 6244, 1975) that a new offence of "dangerous intoxication" should be created. But in the meantime it would be irresponsible to abandon the common law rule, as "mercifully relaxed," which the courts have followed for a century and a half.</span></p>

The latter is all that is required by way of mens rea in a crime of basic intent. But a crime of specific intent requires something more than contemplation of the prohibited act and foresight of its probable consequences. The mens rea in a crime of specific intent requires proof of a purposive element. This purposive element either exists or not; it cannot be supplied by saying that the impairment of mental powers by self‑induced intoxication is its equivalent, for it is not. So that the 19th century development of the law as to the effect of self‑induced intoxication on criminal responsibility is juristically entirely acceptable; and it need be a matter of no surprise that Stephen stated it without demur or question.</span></p>

This illogicality is, however, acceptable to me because the benevolent part of the rule removes undue harshness without imperilling safety and the stricter part of the rule works without imperilling justice. It would be just as ridiculous to remove the benevolent part of the rule (which no one suggests) as it would be to adopt the alternative of removing the stricter part of the rule for the sake of preserving absolute logic. Absolute logic in human affairs is an uncertain guide and a very dangerous master. The law is primarily concerned with human affairs. I believe that the main object of our legal system is to preserve individual liberty. One important aspect of individual liberty is protection against physical violence.</span></p>

The ordinary citizen who is badly beaten up would rightly think little of the criminal law as an effective protection if, because his attacker had deprived himself of ability to know what he was doing by getting himself drunk or going on a trip with drugs, the attacker is to be held innocent of any crime in the assault.

I must re‑emphasise that the <i>Leary</i> rule does not relieve the Crown from its obligation to prove the <i>mens rea</i> in a general intent offence. The fact that an accused may not rely on voluntary intoxication in such offences does not have that effect because of the nature of the offence and the mental elements which must be shown. The requisite state of mind may be proved in two ways. Firstly, there is the general proposition that triers of fact may infer <i>mens rea</i> from the <i>actus reus</i> itself: a person is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his actions. For example, in an offence involving the mere application of force, the minimal intent to apply that force will suffice to constitute the necessary <i>mens rea</i> and can be reasonably inferred from the <u>act</u> itself and the other evidence. Secondly, in cases where the accused was so intoxicated as to raise doubt as to the voluntary nature of his conduct, the Crown may meet its evidentiary obligation respecting the necessary blameworthy mental state of the accused by proving the fact of voluntary self‑induced intoxication by drugs or alcohol. This was the approach suggested in <i>Majewski</i>. In most cases involving intoxication in general intent offences, the trier of fact will be able to apply the first proposition, namely, that the intent is inferable from the <i>actus reus</i> itself. As Fauteux J. observed in <i>R. v. George</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 879, it is almost metaphysically inconceivable for a person to be so drunk as to be incapable of forming the minimal intent to apply force. Hence, only in cases of the most extreme self‑intoxication does the trier of fact need to use the second proposition, that is, that evidence of self‑induced intoxication is evidence of the guilty mind, the blameworthy mental state.</span></p>

They cannot be heard to say: "I was so drunk that I did not know what I was doing". If they managed to get themselves so drunk that they did not know what they were doing, the reckless behaviour in attaining that level of intoxication affords the necessary evidence of the culpable mental condition. Hence, it is logically impossible for an accused person to throw up his voluntary drunkenness as a defence to a charge of general intent. Proof of his voluntary drunkenness can be proof of his guilty mind.</span></p>

Intoxication, whether by alcohol or drugs, lies at the root of many if not most violent assaults: intoxication is clearly a major cause of violent crime. What then is preferable, a recognition of this fact and the adoption of a policy aimed at curbing the problem, or the application of what is said to be logic by providing in law that he who voluntarily partakes of that which is the cause of the crime should for that reason be excused from the consequences of his crime? If that is logic, I prefer policy.</span></p>

In <i>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, and in <i>R. v. Vaillancourt</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, it was held that the requirement for a minimum mental state before the attachment of criminal liability is a principle of fundamental justice. Criminal offences, as a general rule, must have as one of their elements the requirement of a blameworthy mental state. The morally innocent ought not to be convicted. It is said that the <i>Leary</i> rule violates this fundamental premise. In my opinion, the <i>Leary</i> rule clearly does not offend this essential principle of criminal law but rather upholds it. The <i>Leary</i> rule recognizes that accused persons who have voluntarily consumed drugs or alcohol, thereby depriving themselves of self‑control leading to the commission of a crime, are not morally innocent and are, indeed, criminally blameworthy. While the rule excludes consideration of voluntary intoxication in the approach to general intent offences, it nonetheless recognizes that it may be a relevant factor in those generally more serious offences where the <i>mens rea</i> must involve not only the intentional performance of the <i>actus reus</i> but, as well, the formation of further ulterior motives and purposes. It therefore intrudes upon the security of the person only in accordance with sound principle and within the established boundaries of the legal process. For these reasons, I would say that the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is not violated.</span></p>

Crim. R. 348, the court reached a different conclusion and its view has found favour in the judgment of the Chief Justice. I have tried to set out my reasons for rejecting the approach in the <i>O'Connor</i> case. I have done so on the basis that the existing law, resting on a recognition of the distinction between the general and specific intent, has not only served our society well but is not divorced from logical support and is based on sound policy. The present law has long been settled and applied in the United Kingdom. It has been accepted as well in Canada and has general support in the United States and up until the <i>O'Connor</i> case, as far as I have been able to ascertain, has been followed in both Australia and New Zealand. It has, in other words, embraced the greater part of the common law world. For this reason and those earlier outlined, I would not overrule the judgment of this Court in <i>Leary</i> and I would confirm the law as it presently stands. Parliament at some time in the future may intervene in the matter with such statutory provisions as it may consider appropriate but failing that occurrence I would not enlarge the defence of drunkenness, and I do not consider that the suggestion that juries may decline to give effect to such an enlarged defence is a factor to be urged in its favour.</span></p>

I agree with McIntyre J. for the reasons given by him that sexual assault causing bodily harm is an offence of general intent requiring only the minimal intent to apply force. I agree with him also that in most cases involving general intent offences and intoxication the Crown will be able to establish the accused's blameworthy mental state by inference from his or her acts. I think that is the case here. The evidence of intoxication withheld from the trier of fact in this case could not possibly have raised a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the minimal intent to apply force.

There is no requirement of an intent or purpose beyond the intentional application of force. It is first and foremost an assault. It is sexual in nature only because, objectively viewed, it is related to sex either on account of the area of the body to which the violence is applied or on account of words accompanying the violence. Indeed, the whole purpose, as I understand it, of the replacement of the offence of rape by the offence of sexual assault was to emphasize the aspect of violence and put paid to the benign concept that rape was simply the act of a man who was "carried away" by his emotions.</span></p>

There was evidence that the appellant had punched the complainant twice with his closed fist and had threatened to kill her. The doctor who examined the complainant testified that the complainant's right eye was swollen shut and that three stitches were required to close the wound. It is clear from this that there was intentional and voluntary, as opposed to accidental or involuntary, application of force.</span></p>

By his own admission the appellant had sufficient wits about him after the violent assault to hide a bloodied towel and pillowcase from the police. There is no evidence that we are dealing here with extreme intoxication, verging on insanity or automatism, and as such capable of negating the inference that the minimal intent to apply force was present: see <i>R. v. Swietlinski</i> (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 267 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 294, aff'd [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956. The evidence of intoxication in this case was simply not capable of raising a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the minimal intent required. In this I agree with McIntyre J.</span></p>

Illegal acts of the former kind are done "intentionally" in the sense that they are not done by accident or through honest mistake, but acts of the latter kind are the product of preconception and are deliberate steps taken towards an illegal goal. The former acts may be the purely physical products of momentary passion, whereas the latter involve the mental process of formulating a specific intent. A man, far advanced in drink, may intentionally strike his fellow in the former sense at a time when his mind is so befogged with liquor as to be unable to formulate a specific intent in the latter sense.</span></p>

Under these circumstances, evidence that the accused was in a state of voluntary drunkenness cannot be treated as a defence to a charge of common assault because there is no suggestion that the drink which had been consumed had produced permanent or temporary insanity and the respondent's own statement indicates that he knew that he was applying force to the person of another.</span></p>

In order to do this he addressed the question whether there was evidence that the accused was so intoxicated that he could not form a criminal intent and concluded at pp.&nbsp;59‑60:</span></p>

Here is what Bull J.A. said:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">The evidence was clear that the appellant was intoxicated (as was the boy friend Lesley) but there was no suggestion that he was in such a drunken condition either that he did not know what he was doing or that he would not appreciate that his menacing use of the knife, combined with this insistence on sexual intercourse, extorted submission or consent to the act. The appellant's position, as voluntarily made to the police, was merely that he "started petting" with her, removed her tampax for her and had intercourse. The whole statement was clear and concise as to the event and details and negated any such drunken condition.</span></p>

(Assuming this is at all possible in a rape case, see Glanville L. Williams, <i>The Mental Element in Crime</i> (1965), p. 47.) In my opinion, the trial judge merely wanted to guard against the erroneous view that mere drunken condition could be a defence.</span></p>

I view it as preferable to preserve the <i>Leary </i>rule in its more flexible form as Pigeon J. applied it, i.e., so as to allow evidence of intoxication to go to the trier of fact in general intent offences only if it is evidence of extreme intoxication involving an absence of awareness akin to a state of insanity or automatism. Only in such a case is the evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the minimal intent required for the offence. I would not overrule <i>Leary</i>, as the Chief Justice would, and allow evidence of intoxication to go to the trier of fact in every case regardless of its possible relevance to the issue of the existence of the minimal intent required for the offence.</span></p>

There is no relevant mental element. It is no defence that the accused was entirely without fault. He may be morally innocent in every sense, yet be branded as a malefactor and punished as such.</span></p>

Whyte</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3. Again I find myself in respectful disagreement with the Chief Justice and the appellant on this issue. To my mind, the operation of the <i>Leary </i>rule in this case does not have that result because the Crown still must prove that the accused applied force intentionally and the evidence of intoxication is withheld from the jury only because it is incapable of raising a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt. This is not a case in which self‑induced intoxication is being resorted to as a substituted <i>mens rea </i>for the intentional application of force.</span></p>

The issue would, in my view, only arise in those rare cases in which the intoxication is extreme enough to raise doubts as to the existence of the minimal intent which characterizes conscious and volitional conduct. However, as both the Chief Justice and McIntyre J. have addressed the issue, I will express my own somewhat tentative views upon it.</span></p>

While this Court has recognized that in some cases proof of an essential element of a criminal offence can be replaced by proof of a different element, it has placed stringent limitations on when this can happen. In <i>Vaillancourt</i>, <i>supra</i>, Lamer J. said at p.&nbsp;656:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the legislature, rather than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential element, may substitute proof of a different element. In my view, this will be constitutionally valid only if upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the substituted element it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element. If the trier of fact may have a reasonable doubt as to the essential element notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the substituted element, then the substitution infringes ss. 7 and 11(<i>d</i>).</span></p>

This is another way of saying that a statutory presumption infringes the presumption of innocence if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt. Only if the existence of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the conclusion that the essential element exists, with no other reasonable possibilities, will the statutory presumption be constitutionally valid.</span></p>

The requirement of <i>mens rea</i> in truly criminal offences is, as the Chief Justice has demonstrated, so fundamental that it cannot, since the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, be removed on the basis of judicially‑developed policy. It would be anomalous if the courts could infringe such a fundamental right on the basis of such policies when not demonstrated to be essential, while any attempt by Parliament to do so would be subjected to searching scrutiny under s. 1 as established by this Court.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Courier;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">98.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my dissenting reasons in <i>R. v. Landry</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 145, at p. 187, I set forth my views regarding the general issue posed here. I there observed that in the changed constitutional environment brought about by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, if incursions are to be made upon fundamental legal values, it is for Parliament to do so, not the courts. It is the duty of Parliament to respond to the challenge of criminal activities. While the courts must sensitively consider actions taken by Parliament for the protection of the public generally, they must be forever diligent to prevent undue intrusions on our liberty. The courts are the protectors of our rights. It does not sit well for them to make rules intruding on fundamental rights even when this may appear to them to be desirable in a properly balanced system of criminal justice. That is Parliament's work. I added, at p. 189 of <i>Landry</i>:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
letter-spacing:-.15pt">If Parliament in its wisdom finds it necessary to adjust the balance, it can do so. It is in a better position to provide for the precise balance and has a far better access to the knowledge required to achieve that balance than the courts. The courts can then perform their duty of scrutinizing Parliament's laws both in their general tenor and in their particular application to safeguard our traditional values.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

As a repository of our traditional values they may, in fact, assist in defining its norms. But when a common law rule is found to infringe upon a right or freedom guaranteed by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, it must be justified in the same way as legislative rules.
