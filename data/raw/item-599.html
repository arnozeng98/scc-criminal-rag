Shruti">, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:&nbsp; Expert testimony is admissible to assist the fact-finder in drawing inferences in areas where the expert has relevant knowledge or experience beyond that of the lay person.&nbsp; It is difficult for the lay person to comprehend the battered wife syndrome.&nbsp; It is commonly thought that battered women are not really beaten as badly as they claim, otherwise they would have left the relationship.&nbsp; Alternatively, some believe that women enjoy being beaten, that they have a masochistic strain in them.&nbsp; Each of these stereotypes may adversely affect consideration of a battered woman's claim to have acted in self-defence in killing her partner.&nbsp; Expert evidence can assist the jury in dispelling these myths.</span></p>

Abbey</i>, and the decision required on those facts, have contributed to the development of a principle concerning the admissibility and weight of expert opinion evidence that is self-contradictory:&nbsp; an expert opinion relevant in the abstract to a material issue in a trial but based entirely on unproven hearsay is admissible but entitled to no weight whatsoever.&nbsp; Such an opinion, however, is irrelevant and therefore inadmissible.&nbsp; A practical distinction exists between evidence that an expert obtains and acts upon within the scope of his or her expertise, as in consultation with colleagues, and evidence that an expert obtains from a party to litigation touching a matter directly in issue.&nbsp; Where the information upon which an expert forms his or her opinion comes from a party to the litigation, or from any other source that is inherently suspect, a court ought to require independent proof of that information.&nbsp; The lack of such proof will have a direct effect on the weight to be given to the opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where an expert's opinion is based in part upon suspect information and in part upon either admitted facts or facts sought to be proved, the matter is purely one of weight.&nbsp; That was the situation here, and in the circumstances, the trial judge properly admitted the expert evidence and adequately charged the jury.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">Firstly, the comments, placed in juxtaposition to the trial judge's reference to the "two facts, two sources of information that (Dr. Shane) had reference to which are not evidence in this case . . .", lose their impact.&nbsp; The jury may well have concluded that the trial judge's warning related only to Dr. Shane's reference to the marijuana, and to the "confirmatory evidence" of the accused's mother.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">Finally, Philp J.A. finds, at p. 281, that the trial judge's charge fell so short of the standard required in <i>Abbey</i> that a new trial was warranted:</span></p>

Wanrow</i>, 559 P.2d 548 (1977), helpful in illustrating how the factor of gender can be germane to the assessment of what is reasonable.&nbsp; In <i>Wanrow</i> the Washington Supreme Court addressed the standard by which a jury ought to assess the reasonableness of the female appellant's use of a gun against an unarmed intruder.&nbsp; The Court pointed out that the appellant had reason to believe that the intruder had molested her daughter in the past and was coming back for her son.&nbsp; The appellant was a 5'4" woman with a broken leg.&nbsp; The assailant was 6'2" and intoxicated.&nbsp; The Court first observed, at p. 558, that "in our society women suffer from a conspicuous lack of access to training in and the means of developing those skills necessary to effectively repel a male assailant without resorting to the use of deadly weapons."&nbsp; Later it found that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury by creating the impression that the objective standard of reasonableness to be applied to the accused was that of an altercation between two men.&nbsp; At p. 559, the Court makes the following remarks which I find apposite to the case before us:</span></p>

The Queen</i>, <i>supra</i>;&nbsp; <i>R. v. Baxter</i> (1975), 33 C.R.N.S.&nbsp; 22 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Bogue</i> (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 403 (Ont. C.A.)&nbsp; The sense in which "imminent" is used conjures up the image of "an uplifted knife" or a pointed gun.&nbsp; The rationale for the imminence rule seems obvious.&nbsp; The law of self-defence is designed to ensure that the use of defensive force is really necessary.&nbsp; It justifies the act because the defender reasonably believed that he or she had no alternative but to take the attacker's life.&nbsp; If there is a significant time interval between the original unlawful assault and the accused's response, one tends to suspect that the accused was motivated by revenge rather than self-defence.&nbsp; In the paradigmatic case of a one-time barroom brawl between two men of equal size and strength, this inference makes sense.&nbsp; How can one feel endangered to the point of firing a gun at an unarmed man who utters a death threat, then turns his back and walks out of the room?&nbsp; One cannot be certain of the gravity of the threat or his capacity to carry it out.&nbsp; Besides, one can always take the opportunity to flee or to call the police.&nbsp; If he comes back and raises his fist, one can respond in kind if need be.&nbsp; These are the tacit assumptions that underlie the imminence rule.</span></p>

Tension between the two becomes unbearable" (Walker, 1979, p. 59).&nbsp; The second phase, the acute battering incident, becomes inevitable without intervention.&nbsp; Sometimes, she precipitates the inevitable explosion so as to control where and when it occurs, allowing her to take better precautions to minimize her injuries and pain.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
72.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">The first of these common features is an imbalance of power "wherein the maltreated person perceives himself or herself to be subjugated or dominated by the other".&nbsp; The less powerful person in the relationship -- whether battered woman, hostage, abused child, cult follower, or prisoner -- becomes extremely dependent upon, and may even come to identify with, the more powerful person.&nbsp; In many cases, the result of such dependency and identification is that the less powerful, subjugated persons become "more negative in their self-appraisal, more incapable of fending for themselves, and thus more in need of the high power person."&nbsp; As this "cycle of dependency and lowered self-esteem" is repeated over time, the less powerful person develops a "strong affective bond" to the more powerful person in the abusive relationship.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
72.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">The second feature common to the relationships between battered woman and batterer, hostage and captor, battered child and abusive parent, cult follower and leader, and prisoner and guard is the periodic nature of the abuse.&nbsp; In each relationship, the less powerful person is subjected to intermittent periods of abuse, which alternate with periods during which the more powerful, abusive person treats the less powerful person in a "more normal and acceptable fashion."</span></p>

72.0pt;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">Given the clear power differential between battered women and their batterers and the intermittent nature of physical and psychological abuse common to battering relationships, it seems fair to conclude...that many battered women are psychologically unable to leave their batterers because they have developed a traumatic bond with them.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">This strong "affective bond" may be helpful in explaining not only why some battered women remain with their abusers but why they even profess to love them.&nbsp; Of course, as Dr. Ewing adds, environmental factors may also impair the woman's ability to leave -- lack of job skills, the presence of children to care for, fear of retaliation by the man, etc. may each have a role to play in some cases.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:
200%"><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">Abbey</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti"> has been roundly criticized:&nbsp; see, e.g., Schiff, <i>Evidence in the Litigation Process</i>, vol. 1 (3rd ed. 1988), at pp. 473-76; and Delisle, <i>Evidence:&nbsp; Principles and Problems</i> (2nd ed. 1989), at pp. 477-79.&nbsp; The essence of the criticism is that <i>Abbey</i> sets out more restrictive conditions for the use of expert evidence than did previous decisions of this Court (i.e., <i>City of St. John v. Irving Oil Co.</i>, [1966] S.C.R. 581; <i>Wilband v. The Queen</i>, [1967] S.C.R. 14; and <i>R. v. Lupien</i>, [1970] S.C.R. 263).&nbsp; Upon reflection, it seems to me that the very special facts in <i>Abbey</i>, and the decision required on those facts, have contributed to the development of a principle concerning the admissibility and weight of expert opinion evidence that is self-contradictory.&nbsp; The contradiction is apparent in the four principles set out by Wilson J. in the present case, at pp. 000, which I reproduce here for the sake of convenience:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:84.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:84.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:84.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:84.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:
200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">The combined effect of numbers 1, 3 and 4 is that an expert opinion relevant in the abstract to a material issue in a trial but based entirely on unproven hearsay (e.g., from the mouth of the accused, as in <i>Abbey</i>) is admissible but entitled to no weight whatsoever.&nbsp; The question that arises is how any evidence can be admissible and yet entitled to no weight.&nbsp; As one commentator has pointed out, an expert opinion based <u>entirely</u> on unproven hearsay must, if anything, be inadmissible by reason of irrelevance, since the facts underlying the expert opinion are the only connection between the opinion and the case:&nbsp; see Wardle, "<i>R. v. Abbey</i> and Psychiatric Opinion Evidence:&nbsp; Requiring the Accused to Testify" (1984), 17 <i>Ottawa L. Rev.</i> 116, at pp. 122-23.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12.0pt;line-height:
200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">The resolution of the contradiction inherent in <i>Abbey</i>, and the answer to the criticism <i>Abbey</i> has drawn, is to be found in the practical distinction between evidence that an expert obtains and acts upon within the scope of his or her expertise (as in <i>City of St. John</i>), and evidence that an expert obtains from a party to litigation touching a matter directly in issue (as in <i>Abbey</i>).</span></p>

200%"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Shruti">In the former instance, an expert arrives at an opinion on the basis of forms of enquiry and practice that are accepted means of decision within that expertise.&nbsp; A physician, for example, daily determines questions of immense importance on the basis of the observations of colleagues, often in the form of second- or third-hand hearsay.&nbsp; For a court to accord no weight to, or to exclude, this sort of professional judgment, arrived at in accordance with sound medical practices, would be to ignore the strong circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that surround it, and would be, in my view, contrary to the approach this Court has taken to the analysis of hearsay evidence in general, exemplified in <i>Ares v. Venner</i>, [1970] S.C.R. 608.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Jordan</i> (1984), 39 C.R. (3d) 50 (B.C.C.A.), a case concerning an expert's evaluation of the chemical composition of an alleged heroin specimen, Anderson J.A. held, and I respectfully agree, that <i>Abbey</i> does not apply in such circumstances.&nbsp; (See also <i>R. v. Zundel</i> (1987), 56 C.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 52, where the court recognized an expert opinion based upon evidence "... of a general nature which is widely used and acknowledged as reliable by experts in that field.")</span></p>
