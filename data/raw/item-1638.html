   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In certain circumstances, the conduct of an accused after a crime has been committed may provide circumstantial evidence of the accused’s culpability for that crime.&nbsp; However, it may be proper to instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative value when, as a result of an admission by the accused, the evidence cannot logically support an inference of guilt with respect to the offence being tried rather than some other offence.&nbsp; As a general rule, it will be for the jury to decide, on the basis of the evidence as a whole, whether the post-offence conduct of the accused is related to the crime before them rather than to some other culpable act.&nbsp; It is also within the province of the jury to consider how much weight, if any, such evidence should be accorded in the final determination of guilt or innocence.&nbsp; A “no probative value” instruction will thus be called for only in limited circumstances.&nbsp; Such an instruction is most likely to be warranted where the accused has admitted to committing the <i>actus reus</i> of a criminal act but has denied a specific level of culpability for that act, or has denied committing some related offence arising from the same operative set of facts.&nbsp; In such circumstances, it can be said that the post-offence conduct of the accused is “equally explained by” or “equally consistent with” two or more offences.&nbsp; By contrast, a “no probative value” instruction is not required where the accused has denied any involvement in the facts underlying the charge at issue, and has sought to explain his or her actions by reference to some unrelated culpable act.&nbsp; In this case the accused denied any involvement in the murder, and it was therefore their identities as the killers, and not their degree of guilt, which formed the issue in dispute at trial.&nbsp; Since the evidence of their post-offence conduct was relevant to the question of whether they had committed the murder, the trial judge was not required to instruct the jury that it had no probative value.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In cases where a “no probative value” instruction is not required and the post-offence conduct of an accused is put before the jury, the trial judge should nevertheless provide an instruction regarding the proper use of that evidence.&nbsp; In particular, the trial judge should remind the jury that people sometimes flee or lie for entirely innocent reasons, and that even if the accused was motivated by a feeling of guilt, that feeling might be attributable to some culpable act other than the offence for which the accused is being tried.&nbsp; The trial judge was not, however, required to direct the jury to apply the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence of the post-offence conduct,&nbsp; and would have been in error had he done so.&nbsp; The criminal standard of proof applies only to the jury’s final determination of guilt or innocence and is not to be applied to individual items or categories of evidence.&nbsp; Post-offence conduct, like any evidence, takes on its full significance and probative value only in the context of the other evidence in the case.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that the acts of flight and concealment of the accused constituted evidence “which may be considered and weighed by you, as triers of fact, together with all the evidence in deciding the guilt or innocence of the accused”.&nbsp; He reminded the jury that flight or concealment does not necessarily imply guilt, but can arise from any number of innocent motives.&nbsp; He further instructed the jury that there might be “very valid reasons” for the conduct of the accused other than their guilt for the murder, and reviewed the alternative explanations put forth by the defence.&nbsp; The jury charge relating to the evidence of post-offence conduct was therefore adequate as given.</span></p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">I want to deal briefly with the evidence of flight and concealment.&nbsp; And I want to, before I deal with that, I will tell you what the rule is as to [how] you should look at this evidence.&nbsp; What the law says is that flight or concealment of the accused after a crime is committed does not mean that the accused is guilty of the crime.&nbsp; It is common knowledge that people who are entirely innocent sometimes fly from the scene of a crime to avoid apprehension as guilty parties or because they don’t want to get involved as witnesses.&nbsp; But flight is a circumstance which may be considered and weighed by you, as triers of fact, together with all the evidence in deciding the guilt or innocence of the accused.&nbsp; In the circumstance of this case where the evidence of flight is uncontradicted, you may infer that evidence of flight or concealment shows a consciousness of guilt.&nbsp; You have first to decide whether the evidence is evidence of flight or concealment, before you may draw that inference of consciousness of guilt.</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">Now [defence counsel] in their closing submissions told you that there were very valid reasons why the accused were fleeing.&nbsp; They were both parole violators and I suppose that is why they went to Hamilton and to Burlington.&nbsp; After the robberies in Burlington they came back to Ottawa.&nbsp; They wanted to get away from the scene of the robberies.&nbsp; And they both pointed out that in any case they started out in Ottawa and they returned to Ottawa so there is no flight.&nbsp; These are areas of the evidence on the issue of flight that you might want to consider and decide whether to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt or guilt itself.</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The trial judge did not discuss the standard of proof that the jury should apply when considering the evidence of flight and concealment.&nbsp; The jury returned verdicts of first degree murder against both appellants. </p>

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">This case is different from <i>Arcangioli</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Arcangioli</i> the accused admitted an assault and the issue at trial was his level of culpability.&nbsp; On that issue the evidence of consciousness of guilt -- the accused’s flight from the scene -- had no probative value.&nbsp; The evidence of flight was not reasonably capable of supporting the inference that the accused had committed aggravated assault as opposed to common assault.&nbsp; In this case the consciousness of guilt evidence was not led to help the jury determine the appellants’ level of culpability -- first or second degree murder -- for an admitted killing. The evidence was led to help the jury determine whether the appellants were guilty of a killing that they denied having committed.&nbsp; The evidence could have probative value on that issue because it could reasonably support the inference that the appellants’ conduct related to their culpability for killing Chiu rather than to their culpability for the bank robberies or parole violations.</p>

Court</i> (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 237 (Ont. C.A.), the appellants argued that the jury should have been directed to examine the evidence of post-offence conduct separately from the rest of the evidence, and to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether that conduct reflected a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellants for the murder of Chiu; if such a link could not be established, the jury should have been told that they could draw no inference of guilt from the appellants’ conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">You are not obliged to accept any part of the evidence of a witness just because there is no denial of it.&nbsp; If you have a reasonable doubt about any of the evidence you will give the benefit of that doubt to the accused with respect to such evidence.&nbsp; <u>Having decided what evidence you consider worthy of belief, you will consider it as a whole, of course, in arriving at your verdict</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added by Sopinka J.]</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The trial judge in <i>Morin</i> then turned to each category of evidence individually.&nbsp; He instructed the jury that the evidence of hairs and fibres had only limited probative value and did not constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; With respect to the accused’s statements to Hobbs, the judge said:</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">The effect of the misdirections referred to above may very well have been that the jury examined evidence that was crucial to the Crown’s case in bits and pieces.&nbsp; Standing alone or pitted against the evidence of the accused without the support of other evidence, much of this evidence might have been discarded as not measuring up to the test.&nbsp; When the jury came to consider the Crown’s case as a whole there may not have been very much left of it.&nbsp; We cannot know for certain, but this scenario is a very likely one and the charge therefore constituted a serious misdirection. </p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">That error was compounded in <i>Morin</i> by the fact that the judge’s instructions invited the jury to adopt a two-stage analysis in their deliberations, i.e., an initial “fact finding” stage in which items of evidence were to be rejected if not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and then a “verdict” stage in which guilt or innocence was to be determined on the basis of whatever pieces of evidence remained.&nbsp; Sopinka J. rejected this approach at pp. 360-61:</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">The argument in favour of a two-stage application of the criminal standard has superficial appeal in theory but in my respectful opinion is wrong in principle and unworkable in practice.&nbsp; In principle it is wrong because the function of a standard of proof is not the weighing of individual items of evidence but the determination of ultimate issues.&nbsp; Furthermore, it would require the individual member[s] of the jury to rely on the same facts in order to establish guilt.&nbsp; The law is clear that the members of the jury can arrive at their verdict by different routes and need not rely on the same facts.&nbsp; Indeed the jurors need not agree on any single fact except the ultimate conclusion.&nbsp; [Citations omitted.]</p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This approach is consistent with the principle, enunciated in prior decisions of this Court, that where there is a question of credibility between defence and Crown evidence on a vital issue, the jury should be told to consider the record as a whole and to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused’s version of events, rather than simply choosing the more believable of the two accounts: <i>Nadeau v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 570, at pp. 572-73;<i> Morin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 362;<i> R. v. W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at pp. 749-50.&nbsp; Given the dispositive nature of the evidence in question, there is little risk that such an instruction would be misleading, since a jury would ultimately have to apply the criminal standard to the evidence in any event by virtue of the general instructions regarding the burden of proof.&nbsp; Therefore, although the instruction does focus the jury’s attention on two pieces of evidence, in its effect it is not much different from telling them that if all the evidence in the case raises a reasonable doubt in their minds about the guilt of the accused, they must acquit.</p>
