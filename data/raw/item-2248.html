24.4pt">There is no need to revisit <i>Garofoli</i> in view of subsequent legislative amendments and jurisprudential developments.&nbsp; The leave requirement to cross‑examine strikes an appropriate balance between the entitlement to cross‑examination as an aspect of the right to make full answer and defence, and the public interest in the fair, but efficient, use of judicial resources and the timely determination of criminal proceedings.&nbsp; While the right to cross‑examine is of fundamental significance to the criminal trial process, it is neither unlimited nor absolute.&nbsp; The extent to which it becomes a necessary adjunct to the right to make full answer and defence depends on the context.&nbsp; An important contextual factor is the accused’s right to full disclosure.&nbsp; The defence not only has access to all the documents relating to the authorization, but is also entitled to all material in the possession or control of the Crown that is potentially relevant to the case.&nbsp; Another relevant contextual factor is the important distinction between the right to test evidence introduced at the trial on the merits and the threshold evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of that evidence.&nbsp; The <i>Garofoli</i> review hearing is not intended to test the merits of any of the Crown’s allegations in respect of the offence.&nbsp; The truth of the allegations asserted in the affidavit as they relate to the essential elements of the offence remain to be proved by the Crown on the trial proper.&nbsp; Rather, the review is simply an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of relevant evidence about the offence obtained pursuant to a presumptively valid court order.&nbsp; The statutory preconditions for wiretap authorizations will vary depending on the language of the provision that governs their issuance.&nbsp; The reviewing judge on a <i>Garofoli</i> hearing only inquires into whether there was any basis upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory preconditions existed.&nbsp; There is thus only a relatively narrow basis for exclusion.&nbsp; Even if it is established that information contained within the affidavit is inaccurate, or that a material fact was not disclosed, this will not necessarily detract from the existence of the statutory preconditions.&nbsp; In the end analysis, the admissibility of the wiretap evidence will not be impacted under s.&nbsp;8 if there remains a sufficient basis for issuance of the authorization.

24.4pt">In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge did not err in denying the accused leave to cross‑examine the affiant.&nbsp; There was no reasonable likelihood that cross‑examination&nbsp; would elicit evidence of any probative value to the issue for consideration on a review of the authorization.&nbsp; The material issue for consideration on the <i>voir dire </i>in this case is whether at the time of granting the authorization there existed, on an objective basis, reasonable grounds to believe that:&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;an offence was or will be committed and (b)&nbsp;information concerning the offence will be obtained by the proposed interception.&nbsp; There is no contention that the information provided to the affiant by M, if reasonably credible, is insufficient to establish the requisite grounds.&nbsp; Although the affiant’s own credibility may be material on a <i>Garofoli </i>hearing, the proposed cross‑examination could, at best, reveal that the affiant overstated the potential value of polygraph results in support of his belief in M’s truthfulness.&nbsp; This is insufficient to meet the <i>Garofoli</i> threshold.

24.4pt">&nbsp;The threshold test for determining whether cross‑examination should be allowed is separate and distinct from the ultimate question of whether the authorization is valid.&nbsp; Hence, in determining whether the threshold test has been met, the trial judge cannot decide the question simply on the basis that other parts of the affidavit would support the authorization.&nbsp; The focus, rather, must be on the likely effect of the proposed cross‑examination and on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that it will undermine the basis of the authorization.&nbsp; If the test is met, it is only at the conclusion of the <i>voir dire</i> that the trial judge will determine whether, on the basis of the amplified record, there still remains a basis for the authorization.&nbsp; However, the trial judge’s apparent collapse of the two tests was of no consequence&nbsp; in this case.

The extent to which it becomes a necessary adjunct to the right to make full answer and defence depends on the context.&nbsp; The <i>Garofoli </i>threshold test requires that the defence show a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination of the affiant will elicit testimony of probative value to the issue for consideration by the reviewing judge.&nbsp; It is grounded in two basic principles of evidence:&nbsp; relevance and materiality.&nbsp; It is also born out of concerns about the prolixity of proceedings and, in many cases, the need to protect the identity of informants.&nbsp; The rule does not infringe the right to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; There is no constitutional right to adduce irrelevant or immaterial evidence. Further, the leave requirement strikes an appropriate balance between the entitlement to cross-examination as an aspect of the right to make full answer and defence, and the public interest in the fair, but efficient, use of judicial resources and the timely determination of criminal proceedings.</p>

Bordage </i>(2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 549.&nbsp; At trial, the appellants attacked the constitutional validity of the participant surveillance provisions.&nbsp; It was not made clear before this Court on what basis they did so.&nbsp; However, their application was dismissed at trial and the issue was not pursued in the Court of Appeal or in their leave application before this Court.&nbsp; Therefore, to the extent that the appellants’ argument purports to attack the constitutional validity of the underlying legislation, the question is not before us and I do not find it necessary to comment further on it.</p>

Lyttle</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, 2004 SCC 5, at para. 41.&nbsp; If, through cross-examination, the defence can raise a reasonable doubt in respect of any of the essential elements of the offence, the accused is entitled to an acquittal.&nbsp; Likewise, defence evidence, as a general rule, is only subject to exclusion where the prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 611.&nbsp; The appellants rely heavily on these principles in support of their contention that they have a constitutional right to cross-examine the affiant who filed in support of the wiretap authorization.</p>

For example, counsel have referred us to <i>R. v. Vukelich </i>(1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1997] 2 S.C.R xvi, where the importance of avoiding the inefficient use of court time was emphasized by McEachern C.J.B.C.&nbsp; Chief Justice McEachern suggested the following approach at para. 17:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">Generally speaking, I believe that both the reason for having, or not having, a <i>voir dire</i>, and the conduct of such proceedings, should, if possible, be based and determined upon the statements of counsel.&nbsp; This is the most expeditious way to resolve these problems: see <i>R. v. Dietrich</i> (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 49 (Ont. C.A.) at 62; <i>R. v. Hamill</i> (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 338 (B.C.C.A.); and <i>R. v. Kutynec</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.) at 301.&nbsp; I suggest that judges must be more decisive in this connection than they have been in the past because far too much judicial time is consumed by the conduct of these kinds of enquiries.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Finlayson J.A., in <i>R. v. Durette</i> (1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 421 (Ont. C.A.), forcefully and succinctly expressed the same concern in the following words:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">The Supreme Court of Canada and appellate courts across Canada have been attempting in recent years to restrict the issues that go to a jury to those which have, on the evidence, an air of reality to them.&nbsp; Just as we have tried to restrict the trial of an accused on the merits to factual issues that are directly raised in the particular case, so should we strive to restrict pre-trial <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> motions to matters of substance where defence counsel can establish some basis for a violation of a right.&nbsp; Unless we, as courts, can find some method of rescuing our criminal trial process from the almost Dickensian procedural morass that it is now bogged down in, the public will lose patience with our traditional adversarial system of justice.&nbsp; As Jonathan Swift might have said, we are presently sacrificing justice on the shrine of process.

(as she then was) noted in <i>Garofoli</i> (dissenting, but not on this point), cross-examination of the affiant increases the risk that the identity of informers might be revealed:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Cross‑examination is much more likely to reveal the details of investigative operations and the identity of informers than affidavits, which can be carefully drafted to avoid such pitfalls.&nbsp; How can one cross‑examine an officer on the reliability of an informant without probing details that might reveal that informant’s identity, for example?&nbsp; Once a damaging statement is made in answer to a question in cross‑examination, editing is to no avail. [p. 1485]</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">McLachlin J. further noted how difficult it is for the trial judge to restrict the scope of cross-examination:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Attempts to restrict the scope of cross‑examination are notoriously fallible. Since effective cross‑examination usually depends on considerable latitude in questioning, a restricted cross‑examination may be of little value. Moreover, it is often difficult to predict when a particular question will evoke a response that trenches on a prohibited area. [p. 1485]</p>

Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9; access to or cross-examination on matters protected by solicitor-client privilege must meet the requirements of the “innocence at stake” exception; cross-examination on a complainant’s sexual history is prohibited unless it meets the test under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec276subsec1" target="_blank">s. 276(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>; third-party records in respect of certain offences listed under s.&nbsp;278.2 must be shown to be likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify before they will be produced; defences must have an “air of reality” to them before they are put to the jury.&nbsp; In this case, the defence must simply make a show of likely relevance on a material issue before the court.</p>

Lachance</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1490, the proposed cross-examination related to the statutory pre-condition of investigative necessity.&nbsp; (The requirement of showing that other investigative measures have been tried and have failed or that they are unlikely to succeed is not a statutory precondition for granting a consent wiretap authorization.)&nbsp; The basis for cross-examination was established on a showing that the affidavit filed in support of the authorization failed to disclose that a key informer was working as an undercover police agent.</p>

Williams </i>(2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 414, the statements in the affidavit concerning the utility of undercover operations were conclusory only and arguably understated the progress of the investigation. When considered in the context of the strict statutory requirement of showing investigative necessity, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the trial judge had erred in refusing leave to cross-examine the affiant:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">In short, the appellant showed a basis for the view that the cross-examination would elicit testimony tending to discredit the existence of one of the pre-conditions to the authorization, namely the investigative necessity requirement. Investigative necessity is a stringent requirement, requiring demonstration that there is, “practically speaking, <i>no other reasonable alternative method of investigation, in the circumstances of the particular criminal inquiry</i>” (emphasis in original):&nbsp; <i>R. v. Araujo</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), at para. 29.&nbsp; There was a basis for believing that this exacting standard had not been met.&nbsp; The same might be said here of the use of the undercover officers and police agents.

Shruti"> </span>(p. 1465).&nbsp; In this way, the inquiry can remain focussed on the material issues.&nbsp; For example, in <i>R. v. Silvini</i> (1997), 96 O.A.C. 310, the defence argued that once the trial judge granted leave to cross-examine, the only limit on cross-examination should be to curb prolixity and that the trial judge erred in restricting in advance the areas in which defence counsel could cross-examine the affiant.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal for Ontario disagreed and, in referring to the relevant excerpt in <i>Garofoli</i>, stated at para. 9, as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">In our view, this passage . . . gives the judge the discretion to direct the scope of the cross-examination in advance if the judge considers it advisable to do so.&nbsp; No doubt, if the judge found during the cross-examination that the limits were restricting the ability of the accused to demonstrate the grounds upon which the authorization was attacked, the judge would be required to reconsider those limits.&nbsp; Alternatively, the judge could make rulings as the cross-examination proceeds.&nbsp; However, unless it can be shown that this discretion was not exercised judicially, this court cannot interfere.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, this is a sound approach.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The appellants argued before the trial judge that this statement was misleading because, as revealed by the polygraph material, Molsberry had been tested by polygraph only to determine whether he was a “double agent” and not to determine whether he had been “completely truthful in his dealings with the police in this investigation”.&nbsp; (At one point the police had contemplated re-examining Molsberry by polygraph on a wider range of issues; however, they later decided against it because the effectiveness of polygraph testing diminishes on subjects who have already been exposed to testing.) The trial judge agreed with the appellants that this statement in para. 11 was misleading “to the extent” that it says that Sgt. Fraser’s belief in Molsberry’s complete truthfulness was based on the polygraph examination.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial judge was of the view that the statement in para. 11 “appears to be calculated to mislead” because it seemed that it “was designed to lead to the inference that Detective Richards’ belief in the truthfulness of Molsberry was supported by the result of the polygraph test”.&nbsp; The appellants submit that, based on&nbsp; these findings, the trial judge ought to have permitted cross-examination of Detective Richards.&nbsp; However, rather than granting such leave, the trial judge decided for review purposes&nbsp; to disregard the evidence in para. 11.&nbsp; Based on what remained in the affidavit, the trial judge was satisfied that the authorizing judge could have granted the authorization.&nbsp; He therefore dismissed the appellants’ application for leave to cross-examine Detective Richards.</p>

Having reviewed the record, I too question why the trial judge, in the course of his oral ruling, described as he did the statement about the polygraph test in para. 11 of the affidavit.&nbsp; Perhaps he was merely being responsive to counsel’s submissions. &nbsp;Based on the record, it is difficult to understand why it would be misleading to suggest that the results of the polygraph examination formed part of the basis for Detective Richards’ belief in Molsberry’s truthfulness.&nbsp; If the polygraph results had demonstrated that Molsberry was lying and Detective Richards made the same statement, of course, it would clearly be misleading.&nbsp; But the polygraph examiner concluded that Molsberry was truthful when he answered “no” to the following three questions:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding this police investigation have you in any manner, falsely represented yourself to the police?</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Quite apart from the inherent limitations of polygraph testing, I fail to see how these results would do anything but lend support to Detective Richards’ belief in Molsberry’s truthfulness.&nbsp; While the testing appeared limited in scope to the issue of whether Molsberry was a double agent, in the context of the investigation this was a very relevant consideration.&nbsp; The polygraph examination was conducted on July 31, 1996, about three weeks after Molsberry first gave information to the Vancouver police about the appellants and certain other individuals.&nbsp; As noted earlier, the investigation had progressed in the intervening period.&nbsp; Most significant was the observed encounter between Molsberry and the two appellants when he handed Lising $1,000 in payment of the alleged drug debt.&nbsp; Unless Molsberry was in cahoots with the appellants and this&nbsp; was staged, this encounter constituted significant corroboration of his story.&nbsp; Hence, the subsequent confirmation by the polygraph examiner that Molsberry was not a double agent would logically lend further support to Detective Richards’ belief that Molsberry was being truthful.</p>

Bernshaw</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254.)&nbsp; The only requirement is that there exist, on an objective basis, reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been or will be committed and that evidence about the offence will be obtained by means of the proposed interception.&nbsp; The reasonable grounds are often set out, as in this case, by an affiant who swears as to his or her belief in the existence of reasonable grounds and then explains on what facts it is based.&nbsp; The authorizing judge is then in a position to consider the facts and independently decide whether reasonable grounds have been made out.&nbsp; It is in the context of setting out the factual basis for his belief in the existence of reasonable grounds that Detective Richards related in para. 11 the information provided to him by Sgt. Fraser about the polygraph test.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, the appellants have not met this threshold.&nbsp; At most, the appellants have shown a basis to believe that cross-examination will elicit testimony that tends to discredit Detective Richards’ credibility on the peripheral matter of the polygraph examination results.&nbsp; This, however, is insufficient.&nbsp; The appellants have not shown any basis to conclude that cross-examination will tend to impugn Detective Richards’ credibility on any of the statements in his affidavit that form the essential basis for issuing the authorization.&nbsp; Nor does the misleading statement in ¶ 11 create any reasonable possibility that cross-examination of Detective Richards would elicit testimony that casts so much doubt on his credibility that the reliability of his entire affidavit would be tainted.&nbsp; Accordingly, and unlike <i>Garofoli</i>, <i>supra</i>, the misleading statement in ¶ 11 does not go to the foundation of the authorization.&nbsp; It is, rather, as in <i>Vukelich</i>, <i>supra</i>, unrelated to “the essence of the case”.

Having correctly refused leave to cross-examine, the next step was to determine the authorization’s validity on the basis of the material before him. The fact that he proceeded to do so without considering para. 11 is of no consequence to the appellants. I therefore see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s ruling.</p>
