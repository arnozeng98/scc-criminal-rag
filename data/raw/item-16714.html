After A failed a roadside screening device test, he provided samples of his breath at the police station which registered readings significantly over the legal limit. A was charged with driving “over 80”, contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec253" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;253<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. At trial, it was uncontested that A provided the breath samples into an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician within the prescribed time periods, and that the readings were reliable. Once these preconditions are met, the Crown can take advantage of the shortcuts found in ss.&nbsp;258(1)(c) and 258(1)(g) of the <i>Code</i> to establish an accused’s blood‑alcohol concentration at the time of the alleged offence by filing a certificate recording the accused’s breath readings. This relieves the Crown from having to call two witnesses at every trial: a breath technician and an expert toxicologist. In the instant case, the trial judge found that the grounds to make the breath demand were insufficient, but applied <i>Rilling v. The Queen</i>,<i> </i>[1976] 2 S.C.R. 183, which held that it is unnecessary for the Crown to prove a lawful demand in order to rely on the evidentiary shortcuts.

margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><i>Per </i>Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Wagner, Gascon and Côté&nbsp;JJ.: The text of ss.&nbsp;258(1)(c) and 258(1)(g) of the <i>Code</i> does not support the requirement of a lawful demand for the evidentiary shortcuts to apply. First, Parliament could easily have specified that the sample had to be taken “pursuant to a <u>lawful</u> demand” as it has done elsewhere in the <i>Code</i>. Second, this interpretation is in tension with the structure of the provisions, which is comprised of an opening part followed by a specific list of preconditions that must be met, all of which bear directly on the reliability of the evidentiary shortcuts. The meaning of the phrase “pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3)” is simply to identify a breath sample as the bodily sample to which the provisions apply, which may have been unclear at the time of their initial enactment in 1969. In any event, plain meaning alone is not determinative and a statutory interpretation analysis is incomplete without considering the context, purpose and relevant legal norms.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose and context of the provisions do not support the requirement of a lawful demand for the evidentiary shortcuts to apply. Their overriding purpose is to streamline proceedings by dispensing with unnecessary evidence. The preconditions governing these shortcuts are concerned with the reliability of the breath test results and their correlation to the accused’s blood‑alcohol concentration at the time of the offence. The lawfulness of a breath demand has no bearing on these matters. This purpose is distinct from that of s.&nbsp;254(3), which establishes and defines police powers, including the prerequisites for a lawful breath demand. The overriding purpose of the evidentiary shortcuts would be frustrated by importing a lawful demand requirement. Requiring the Crown to call two additional witnesses will lead to unreasonable delays in drinking and driving proceedings that are counterproductive to the administration of justice as a whole and frustrate Parliament’s intent.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comparison to the s. 254(5) refusal offence is flawed. While the refusal offence is part of the same statutory regime, it is different from other drinking and driving offences in substance. Culpability for the refusal offence is based on disobedience with lawful compulsion, whereas culpability for an “over 80” offence is based on driving with a blood‑alcohol concentration over the legal limit. Therefore, it is not unfair that a person who refuses to comply with an unlawful demand is acquitted, but if that same person complies and is prosecuted for an “over 80” offence, the evidentiary shortcuts continue to apply. This does not discourage compliance with breath demands. It remains a dangerous gamble for an individual to deliberately refuse a breath demand. If the demand is later found to be lawful, that person may be convicted, even if he or she was actually under the proscribed limit.</p>

The scientific reliability of the results of properly administered breath tests is now firmly established. And today, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, in combination with s.&nbsp;24(2), provides a comprehensive and direct protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, including those of breath samples. By contrast, a loss of the s.&nbsp;258 evidentiary shortcuts does not provide a meaningful remedy for an unlawful demand by the police and achieves no substantive or procedural benefit for an accused — it merely requires the Crown to call two unnecessary witnesses to arrive at the same result.<b> </b>Such an approach would be antithetical to the Court’s recent jurisprudence emphasizing the importance of participants in the criminal justice system working together to achieve fair and timely justice.</p>

margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a lawful demand was not a precondition to the s.&nbsp;258 evidentiary shortcuts, there is no basis in this case for appellate interference and A’s conviction must be upheld.</p>

(dissenting): The requirement for reasonable grounds to demand a breath sample under s.&nbsp;254(3) of the <i>Code</i> is a precondition to the operation of the presumptions in ss.&nbsp;258(1)(c) and 258(1)(g). <i>Rilling</i> is therefore no longer good law. A balancing between the values of correctness and certainty leads to the conclusion that the need to correct the law predominates in this case. As a result, A’s appeal should be allowed, his conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>

Such an interpretation conflates the issues of admissibility under common law with the operation of the evidentiary shortcuts, per s.&nbsp;258(1) of the <i>Code</i>. This interpretation has been attenuated by later jurisprudence <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">which identifies the distinction between admissibility and preconditions to evidentiary shortcuts, and by </span>the importance of a statutory precondition of reasonable and probable grounds being satisfied to ensure a lawful search and seizure in<i> </i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> context.

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading ss.&nbsp;258(1)(c) and 258(1)(g) in their entire context and according to their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Act and the intention of Parliament, the reasoning in <i>Rilling </i>cannot withstand scrutiny. The phrase “pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3)” does not simply identify the sample to which the provision applies. That such words are meaningless is not plausible. This alternate interpretation would mean that the other requirements of s.&nbsp;254(3), such as the requirement that the demand be made by a peace officer or that the demand be made as soon as practicable, are also not required for the evidentiary shortcuts to apply. This would mean that the Crown would have the benefit of the evidentiary presumptions for any sample, irrespective of the conditions under which the demand was made. Furthermore, the interpretation that “pursuant to” imports the conditions under s.&nbsp;254 as a pre‑condition of the evidentiary presumptions under s.&nbsp;258(1) is consistent with the position the minority endorsed in <i>Rilling</i> and with later appellate case law.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reversing <i>Rilling </i>will not undermine the efficacy of the statutory scheme, or disrupt the proper administration of justice. In prosecuting “over 80” charges, where the peace officer acted without reasonable grounds, the Crown will not be able to rely on the evidentiary shortcuts. However, the Crown will still be able to prove its case where it has the evidence to do so, even if it takes longer. Thus, no injustice will arise. While the Crown may be inconvenienced, it is more important that these provisions of the <i>Code</i> be given their proper meaning and effect. As well, today’s criminal procedure framework is different from that which was in place when <i>Rilling </i>was decided. Current procedures, such as disclosure, charge screening and pre‑trials, ensure that parties are aware of issues before a trial begins. The loss of evidentiary presumptions is a distinct issue from whether the certificate would be admissible, which is governed by the rules of evidence subject to any <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> applications. Thus, there would be no ambush after the Crown had closed its case. The statutory scheme will still be able to function as it should without the rule in <i>Rilling</i>.</p>

One such step, which dates back to 1969, involved the introduction of evidentiary shortcuts into the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par4" class="">4</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To ensure that these evidentiary shortcuts yield reliable evidence, Parliament built a number of preconditions into the scheme, the most notable being that the breath samples have to be taken within a prescribed period of time following the alleged offence; the samples have to be provided directly into an approved container or instrument; and the instrument has to be operated by a properly qualified technician.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par5" class="">5</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in this appeal is whether, in addition to the three preconditions just mentioned, the Crown must also establish that the demand for the breath sample made by the police was a “lawful” demand before it can take advantage of the evidentiary shortcuts.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par6" class="">6</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rilling v. The Queen</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 183, a majority of this Court held that it was unnecessary for the Crown to prove a lawful demand in order to rely on the evidentiary shortcuts. This appeal raises the question of whether <i>Rilling </i>remains good law.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par7" class="">7</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of the present case are straightforward. On April 21, 2012, the police stopped a vehicle driven by the appellant, Mr. Alex, and conducted a typical drinking and driving investigation. After Mr. Alex failed a roadside screening device test, the police officer demanded that he accompany the officer to the police station to provide samples of his breath. Mr. Alex complied and registered readings significantly over the legal limit. Accordingly, Mr. Alex was charged with driving “over 80”, contrary to s. 253 of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par8" class="">8</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, it was uncontested that Mr. Alex provided the breath samples into an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician within the prescribed time periods, and that the readings were reliable. However, Mr. Alex argued that the breath sample demand was unlawful because the police lacked reasonable grounds to make it. Rather than bringing a<i> </i>challenge to exclude the evidence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, he chose instead to argue that the absence of reasonable grounds for the demand deprived the Crown of the s. 258 evidentiary shortcuts.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par9" class="">9</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge agreed that the grounds were insufficient, he applied <i>Rilling </i>and permitted the Crown to file a certificate of analysis as proof of Mr. Alex’s blood-alcohol concentration at the time of the alleged offence. Mr. Alex presented no defence and he was convicted of driving “over 80”.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par10" class="">10</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Successive appeals by Mr. Alex to the British Columbia Supreme Court (2014 BCSC 2328, 71 M.V.R. (6th) 228) and British Columbia Court of Appeal (2015 BCCA 435, 377 B.C.A.C. 301) were dismissed on the basis that <i>Rilling </i>remained binding. Before this Court, Mr. Alex submits that <i>Rilling </i>is no longer good law. He says it was wrongly decided and should be reversed.</p>

If the taking of the samples is subjected to <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>scrutiny, and the evidence of the breath test results is found to be inadmissible by virtue of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">ss. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, that will end the matter.

The evidentiary shortcuts were designed by Parliament to simplify and streamline drinking and driving proceedings. A lawful demand requirement does not further Parliament’s intent; rather, it serves to frustrate it.</p>

To be clear, these shortcuts do not affect whether the accused’s breath readings are admissible or not. They affect only the <i>manner of admission</i> — specifically, whether the Crown must call two additional witnesses: one to verify the accuracy of the certificate and enter it as an exhibit, and the other to opine on the accused’s blood-alcohol concentration at the time of the alleged offence — matters which have no connection to the lawfulness of the breath demand. This was made clear in <i>R. v. Deruelle</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 663, at pp. 673-74, where the Court observed that the breath readings remain admissible at common law through <i>viva voce </i>evidence, irrespective of whether the shortcuts apply.</p>

First, he submits that the plain meaning of the opening words of the text, referred to in the preceding paragraph, requires that the demand be shown to be lawful. Second, he revives the dissenting opinion in <i>Rilling </i>that Parliament intended the provisions to include a lawful demand precondition to provide “another protection of the accused” in the face of police powers of compulsion (<i>Rilling</i>, at p. 194), adding that the adoption of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>should reinforce the importance of this protection. Finally, he contends that this interpretation is necessary to achieve harmony, both textual and as a matter of policy, with the s. 254(5) offence of refusing to comply with a breath demand.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par25" class="">25</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beginning with the text of ss. 258(1)(c) and 258(1)(g), Mr. Alex argues that the phrase “pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3)” in the opening clause of each provision unambiguously supports his position that the evidentiary shortcuts apply only where a lawful demand is made under s. 254(3). When this phrase is viewed in isolation, I acknowledge that his position is arguable. However, two considerations cast doubt on Mr. Alex’s plain reading of the text.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par26" class="">26</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Parliament could easily have specified that the sample had to be taken “pursuant to a <u>lawful</u> demand”. There are many examples throughout the <i>Code </i>where Parliament has done just that. For instance, in s. 127(1) of the <i>Code</i>,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[3]</span></sup></span></sup></span></a> Parliament has made it clear that to convict a person for disobeying a court order, the underlying order must be “lawful”:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst"><b>127 (1)</b> Every one who, without lawful excuse, disobeys a <u>lawful</u> order made by a court of justice or by a person or body of persons authorized by any Act to make or give the order, other than an order for the payment of money, is, unless a punishment or other mode of proceeding is expressly provided by law, guilty of</p>

Each includes an opening part followed by a specific list of preconditions that must be met before the evidentiary shortcuts can apply (ss. 258(1)(c)(i) to (iv) and 258(1)(g)(i) to (iii)). These preconditions share a common theme of ensuring that certain procedures are followed in the taking and recording of a breath reading, all of which bear directly on the reliability of the evidentiary shortcuts. In particular, they set out requirements pertaining to the timing, method, instrument type and operator qualifications. The lawfulness of a breath demand does not mesh with this theme. It has no bearing on the reliability of the evidentiary shortcuts. Moreover, there is nothing in the text of the provisions to indicate that the various reliability-related preconditions listed in each are meant to be non-exhaustive. Mr. Alex’s interpretation does not conform to this basic structure of the provisions. Instead, it calls for fragmented preconditions in separate clauses.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par28" class="">28</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of these considerations, it is not clear to me that a plain reading of the provisions supports Mr. Alex’s position that the evidentiary shortcuts depend on a lawful demand.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par29" class="">29</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Alex submits, however, that unless his interpretation is adopted, the words in the opening clause are rendered meaningless. My colleague shares this view (para. 89).</p>

In my view, the phrase “pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3)” simply identifies the bodily sample to which the provisions apply — that is, a breath sample. This reading finds support in the legislative history of the provisions. At the time of their initial enactment in 1969, they contained references to blood, urine, breath and other bodily samples. The opening words therefore played a meaningful role in clarifying the specific sample to which the provisions were meant to apply.</p>

British Columbia (Securities Commission)</i>, 2013 SCC 67, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 43; <i>ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v.

In the words of McLachlin C.J. and Deschamps J. in <i>Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc.</i>, 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 141, this is necessary because (para. 10):</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words that appear clear and unambiguous may in fact prove to be ambiguous once placed in their context. The possibility of the context revealing a latent ambiguity such as this is a logical result of the modern approach to interpretation.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day . . . the court must adopt an interpretation that is appropriate. An appropriate interpretation is one that can be justified in terms of (a) its plausibility, that is, its compliance with the legislative text; (b) its efficacy, that is, its promotion of legislative intent; and (c) its acceptability, that is, the outcome complies with accepted legal norms; it is reasonable and just.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par34" class="">34</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the plain meaning of the provisions is read harmoniously with their purpose and context, Parliament’s intent becomes clear: the Crown need not establish the lawfulness of a breath demand for the evidentiary shortcuts in ss. 258(1)(c) and 258(1)(g)&nbsp; to apply. The overriding purpose of the evidentiary shortcuts is to streamline proceedings by dispensing with unnecessary evidence. The preconditions governing the evidentiary shortcuts are concerned with the reliability of the breath test results and their correlation to the accused’s blood-alcohol concentration at the time of the offence. The lawfulness of a breath demand has no bearing on these matters. This purpose is distinct from that of s. 254(3), which establishes and defines police powers, including the prerequisites for a lawful breath demand. Although the general objective of the statutory drinking and driving regime is the same, “the specific purposes of each mechanism are different”: <i>Deruelle</i>, at p. 672.&nbsp; As I will explain, the overriding purpose of the evidentiary shortcuts — streamlining trial proceedings — would be frustrated by importing a lawful demand requirement.</p>
 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Overriding Purpose of Streamlining Proceedings Would Be Frustrated by Importing a Lawful Demand Requirement</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par35" class="">35</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Requiring the Crown to prove the lawfulness of the breath demand before the evidentiary shortcuts can apply would frustrate their overriding purpose: to streamline the trial process in this heavily litigated and complex area of the law. In <i>R. v. Vanderbruggen</i> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 489 (Ont. C.A.), Rosenberg J.A. urged a sensible and practical approach to interpreting the drinking and driving statutory regime, stating at para. 16:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, these provisions, <u>which are designed to expedite trials and aid in proof of the suspect’s blood-alcohol level</u>, should not be interpreted so as to require an exact accounting of every moment in the chronology. We are now far removed from the days when the breathalyser was first introduced into Canada and there may have been some suspicion and scepticism about its accuracy and value and about the science underlying the presumption of identity. <u>These provisions must be interpreted reasonably in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose in facilitating the use of this reliable evidence.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">This sentiment has been echoed in other cases: <i>R. v. Ware</i>, 30 C.R.N.S. 308 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 315; <i>R. v. Forsyth </i>(1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 23 (Man. C.A.), at p. 26.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par36" class="">36</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary shortcuts are intended to avoid needless delays in drinking and driving proceedings. Yet if the Crown is required to prove that the demand is lawful before they can apply, this purpose will be frustrated with some frequency, given that the distinction between reasonable grounds and the absence of such grounds is often a fine one. Two witnesses will be required to attend court in order to prove that which a certificate of analysis reliably establishes. And this, in turn, will lead to unreasonable delays that are counterproductive to the administration of justice as a whole, without any compelling justification.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par37" class="">37</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with my colleague’s suggestion that a loss of the evidentiary shortcuts will merely cause “inconvenienc[e]” to the Crown and make it take “longer to prove its case” (para. 98). The potential consequences of Mr. Alex’s position should not be underestimated. In theory, the need for these extra witnesses would be confined to a limited minority of cases where a trial judge determines an unlawful demand was made. But in reality, because the lawfulness of a demand remains uncertain until a determination is made at trial, the practical consequences manifest themselves much earlier in the proceedings at the point of trial scheduling. And in drinking and driving cases, the lawfulness of a breath demand, and specifically the officer’s grounds, are frequently in issue and can arise at any point, including during an officer’s testimony at the trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par38" class="">38</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, in many cases, trial scheduling would have to account for the possibility that two additional witnesses would be required to testify. This would extend estimated lengths of trial proceedings: one day trials would become two day trials, two day trials would become three days, and so on. In addition, the Crown would have to be prepared to call a breath technician and toxicologist in every case and limitations on their availability could add to the delay. And the effects do not end there. The consequences of trial scheduling are pervasive, creating backlogs and congestion throughout the justice system as a whole. This raises the following question: For what purpose? The answer, as I will explain, is none, other than to provide an accused with a hollow form of protection against police misconduct which the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>now accounts for in a much more satisfactory and meaningful way.</p>

In combination with s. 24(2), s. 8 provides an effective recourse for challenging the lawfulness of breath demands and a meaningful remedy in the form of excluding the breath test results. Thus, s. 8 also addresses my colleague’s concerns about ensuring that police are “conforming to the requirements of the law”, including the “other requirements of s. 254(3), such as the requirement that the demand be made by a peace officer or that the demand be made as soon as practicable” (paras. 99 and 90).</p>

For example, non-compliance with the statutory search warrant requirements does not result in automatic loss of the evidence — rather it is subject to challenge under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>: see <i>R. v.

Indeed, I would hesitate to characterize it as a remedy at all. In reality, eliminating these evidentiary shortcuts achieves no substantive or procedural benefit for an accused. It merely requires the Crown to call two unnecessary witnesses — a breath technician and toxicologist — in order to arrive at the same result.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span class="MsoHyperlink"><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[5]</span></sup></span></sup></span></a> An unlawful breath demand does not affect the reliability of the inferences that flow from the shortcuts so as to make testimony from these witnesses necessary.</p>

In my view, we should avoid an interpretation that forces the Crown to call unnecessary witnesses and promotes an outcome not based on the merits, but rather on the limitations of an overburdened criminal justice system. Indeed, such an approach would be antithetical to this Court’s recent jurisprudence emphasizing the importance of participants in the criminal justice system working together to achieve fair and timely justice: <i>R. v. Jordan</i>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at paras. 2-3 and 19-28.</p>

However, the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>now fulfills the role of regulating the lawfulness of police breath demands in a more effective and logical manner.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par47" class="">47</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr. Alex submits that the s. 254(5) offence of refusing to provide a breath sample is relevant to the interpretation of the s. 258 evidentiary shortcuts. Section 254(5) states:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC"><b>(5)</b>&nbsp;Everyone commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made under this section.</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">Mr. Alex points to the similarity between the opening words of the s. 258 evidentiary presumptions and the reference in s. 254(5) to “a demand <u>made under</u> this section”.&nbsp; The Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario), in turn, relies on jurisprudence that has recognized a lawful demand as an element of the refusal offence: citing <i>R. v. MacDonald</i> (1974), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 350 (N.S.C.A.), at para. 35; see also<i> R. v. Moser </i>(1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.), per Doherty J.A., concurring in the result. In addition, as a matter of policy, Mr. Alex submits it would be unfair and anomalous if the Crown only had to establish the lawfulness of a demand if an accused refused, but not if the accused complied with the demand.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par48" class="">48</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have difficulty with this comparison for a number of reasons. First, the textual argument assumes that the language of s. 254(5) requires the lawfulness of the demand to be an element of the offence. In my view, however, this element is better thought of as arising from the general nature of the refusal offence — an offence which criminalizes disobedience in response to lawful compulsion. Notwithstanding the words “made under”, disobedience with unlawful compulsion is simply not criminal. For example, the unlawfulness of an arrest can provide a complete defence to the charge of resisting arrest under s. 270 of the <i>Code</i>: <i>R. v. Plamondon</i> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 314 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 29; see also <i>R. v. Plummer</i> (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 528 (C.A.), at paras. 1 and 48-49.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par49" class="">49</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This exposes a logical flaw in the analogy. While the refusal offence is part of the same statutory regime, it is different from other drinking and driving offences in substance. Culpability for the refusal offence is based on disobedience with lawful compulsion, whereas culpability for an “over 80” offence is based on driving with a blood-alcohol concentration over the legal limit. The lawfulness of the breath demand has no logical bearing on culpability for an “over 80” offence. As this Court observed in <i>Taraschuk v. The Queen</i>, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 385, conflating the elements of the two offences “invites a self-defeating construction of [s. 254(5)] and would wipe out the difference, clearly made in [ss. 253 and 254(5)], between culpability under the one and under the other” (p. 388). As a result, I do not find this textual comparison to be persuasive.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par50" class="">50</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The distinct nature of these offences also undermines Mr. Alex’s submission that it is unfair that a person who refuses to comply with an unlawful demand is acquitted, but if that same person complies and is prosecuted for an “over 80” offence, the evidentiary shortcuts will continue to apply. Moreover, Mr. Alex’s suggestion that this fosters absurdity in the law by discouraging compliance with breath demands is unpersuasive. For decades, the law under <i>Rilling </i>has been applied<i> </i>and there is no foundation to the practical concern about discouraging compliance with breath demands. Indeed, it remains a dangerous gamble for an individual to deliberately refuse a breath demand. If the demand is later found to be lawful, the refuser may be convicted, even if he or she was actually under the proscribed limit: <i>Taraschuk</i>, at p. 388.</p>

He registered a fail on an approved screening device (“ASD”) administered by Constable Caruso. At the police station, Mr. Alex’s breath samples registered 140 mg and 130 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, respectively.</p>

Constable Caruso did not identify any other indicia of impairment; Mr. Alex had no difficulty parking and exiting the vehicle. Constable Caruso made no notes about how he came to form a suspicion that Mr. Alex had alcohol in his body, but he testified that he knew he had formed a reasonable suspicion because he would not have made the demand otherwise.</p>

Wray</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 272) that relevant evidence obtained by a police officer in a manner that is not lawfully authorized is nonetheless admissible. As such, Judson J.’s majority reasons in <i>Rilling </i>render the statutory term “reasonable grounds”, as a precondition to making a breath demand, meaningless. By contrast, Spence J.’s dissenting reasons in <i>Rilling</i> give effect to Parliament’s intention that “reasonable grounds” operate as a precondition to a breath demand, thereby protecting citizens from unwarranted police action. In the appellant’s submission, the “reasonable grounds” requirement should operate as a statutory protection against unlawful search. Thus, the ruling in <i>Rilling</i> runs contrary to a plain reading of s. 254(3). Mr. Alex submits that admitting unlawfully obtained evidence only accords with law if such evidence is nonetheless admissible, i.e. what was affirmed by this Court in <i>Wray</i>.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par73" class="">73</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario) (“CLA”) intervened in support of the appellant. The CLA argued that <i>Rilling </i>should be overturned, as compliance with the requirement for “reasonable grounds” in order to demand breath samples under s. 254(3) is clearly a statutory precondition to the presumptions in s.&nbsp;258(1)(c) and (g).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par74" class="">74</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CLA challenged the Crown’s argument that overturning <i>Rilling </i>would severely disrupt the administration of justice. The CLA argued that, <i>inter alia</i>, requiring that a demand be made in accordance with the precondition of “reasonable grounds” before being able to rely on the evidentiary presumptions in s. 258(1) is no more than what the Crown must already do to rely on other evidentiary presumptions. Similarly, overturning <i>Rilling </i>would not result in automatic exclusion of evidence and acquittals.&nbsp; The presumptions in s. 258(1) do not deal with admissibility of evidence concerning breath samples <i>per se</i>; rather they only provide “shortcuts” to the proof of the certificate’s contents, which it is open to the Crown to prove by other means. Moreover, the Crown’s argument is based on the unproven assertion that requiring the Crown to lead evidence that the officer had “reasonable grounds” to make a breath sample demand would cripple the justice system.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par75" class="">75</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that <i>Rilling </i>should be affirmed as good law and that applying <i>Rilling</i> merely deprives accused persons of the chance to defeat s. 258(1) presumptions for reasons entirely unconnected to their rationale and the text of the provisions. The Crown relies on <i>Rilling </i>for the proposition that while absence of reasonable and probable grounds for belief of impairment may afford a defence to a refusal to provide a breath sample charge under s. 254(5), it does not render the certificate inadmissible and the presumptions inoperative. The motive that actuates a peace officer to make a demand under s. 254(3) is not a relevant consideration when the accused has complied with the demand. Relevant evidence of an “over 80” offence is <i>prima facie</i> admissible unless a legal rule provides for its exclusion, and s. 254(3) contains no such rule. In essence, the Crown restated the rationale relied on by Judson J. in <i>Rilling</i>.</p>

The interpretation in <i>Rilling </i>is consistent with Parliament’s intent; had Parliament intended a valid demand to be a precondition to the reliance on the evidentiary presumption in s. 258(1)(c), then reasonable grounds for a breath sample demand would be an enumerated requirement under s. 258(1) itself.</p>

The answer to this turns on the status of <i>Rilling</i>. Unless <i>Rilling</i> is overturned by this Court, it is dispositive of the issue under appeal.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par78" class="">78</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court has previously considered when it should overrule one of its decisions (see <i>Ontario (Attorney General) v. Fraser</i>, 2011 SCC 20, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 3; <i>R. v. Henry</i>, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609; and <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford</i>, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101). There are several, non-exhaustive factors this Court can consider to determine this. Essentially, there is a balancing between the values of correctness and certainty. The Court must ask whether it is “preferable to adhere to an incorrect precedent to maintain certainty, or to correct the error” (<i>Canada v. Craig</i>, 2012 SCC 43, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 27). In my view, for the reasons that follow, the need to correct the law predominates in this case.</p>

In doing so, the majority incorrectly conflated the issues of admissibility under common law (as per <i>Wray</i>) with the operation of the evidentiary shortcuts (per s. 258(1) of the <i>Code</i>).</p>

Under “duress” by police (which I take to mean the use of force or the threat of force), the accused made a statement and showed police where he had discarded the gun. Ballistics showed it was the murder weapon. The gun was received into evidence, as was that part of Mr. Wray’s statement that was confirmed by the gun. Mr. Wray was acquitted at trial as the trial judge refused to admit the evidence of Mr. Wray’s involvement in finding the murder weapon.</p>

It affirmed the acquittal:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our view, a trial [j]udge has a discretion to reject evidence, even of substantial weight, if he considers that its admission would be unjust or unfair to the accused or calculated to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, the exercise of such discretion, of course, to depend upon the particular facts before him. Cases where to admit certain evidence would be calculated to bring the administration of justice into disrepute will be rare, but we think the discretion of a trial [j]udge extends to such cases.

Spence J., dissenting, wrote in favour of the Ontario Court of Appeal’s approach. Hall J. and Cartwright C.J. each wrote separate reasons to similar effect. The majority (in two sets of reasons, one by Judson J., and one by Martland J.) rejected the Ontario Court of Appeal’s approach; they affirmed the traditional rule that relevant but illegally obtained evidence is admissible.</p>

The interpretative question, before the Court, was “whether the two-hour limit referred to in s. 254(3) . . . applies to the making of the breath or blood sample demand, or to the formation of the peace officer’s belief on reasonable and probable grounds that a person is committing or has committed, as a result of the consumption of alcohol, an offence under s. 253 of the <i>Code</i>” (p. 671).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par86" class="">86</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering competing lines of analysis regarding the meaning of the time limits under s. 254(3), the Court noted that the specific purpose of s. 254(3) “which goes to the admissibility of the sample into evidence, can be distinguished from the purpose of the time limit in the presumption section, s. 258(1)(c)” (p. 672). As explained by Justice La Forest, writing for the Court, whereas s. 258(1)(c) is a procedural shortcut, it is not concerned with admissibility (p. 672).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par87" class="">87</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, by implicitly endorsing the rule affirmed in <i>Wray</i>, the majority in <i>Rilling</i> erred in deciding the issue on the basis of admissibility of evidence at common law rather than on an interpretation of the evidentiary shortcuts in the <i>Code</i>. In doing so, the majority failed to engage in a statutory interpretation of the relevant sections of the <i>Code</i>. The provisions of the <i>Code</i> at issue in this appeal set out where a certificate can be admitted, in the absence of <i>viva voce </i>testimony, and the evidentiary presumptions that follow. The interpretation and application of this provision properly turns on a statutory interpretation exercise.</p>
 <p class="Title2LevelTitre2Niveau"><span style="font-style:normal">B.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Statutory Interpretation</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par88" class="">88</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The holding in <i>Rilling</i> has also been attenuated by subsequent jurisprudence of this Court, namely, <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, which sets out the modern approach to statutory interpretation: the words of the provision must be read in their entire context and according to their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Act and the intention of Parliament (para. 21, citing E. A. Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i> (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87). Reading s. 258(1)(c) and (g) in this way, the reasoning in <i>Rilling </i>cannot withstand scrutiny. Whether or not a demand was made by an officer who had reasonable grounds to do so is an express precondition to the applicability of the evidentiary presumptions set out in s. 258(1)(c) and (g), the opening words of which read: “. . . where samples of the breath of the accused have been <u>taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3)</u> . . . .”</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par89" class="">89</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height:200%">The <i>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles</i> (6th ed. 2007) defines “pursuant to” as “</span>consequent and conforming to; in accordance with” (p.&nbsp;2412). The French version of s. 258(1)(c) and (g) is to similar effect, using the phrase “<i>conformément à</i>”. For the meaning of “pursuant to”, see also: <i>Dastous v. Matthews-Wells Co.,</i> [1950] S.C.R. 261; <i>Minister of National Revenue v. Armstrong</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 446, at p. 447. If the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 254(3) are not a precondition to the operation of s. 258(1)(c) and (g), then why is there a reference to s.&nbsp;254(3) at all? That such words are meaningless is not plausible. If reasonable grounds under s. 254(3) are not a precondition, then what does the reference to “pursuant to” in the opening words of both s. 258(1)(c) and (g) mean? That such words have no legal effect is implausible.&nbsp; My colleague, Justice Moldaver, finds that these words simply identify the sample to which the provision applies (para. 30). In my respectful view, this cannot be the case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par90" class="">90</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This alternate interpretation would mean that the other requirements of s. 254(3), such as the requirement that the demand be made by a peace officer or that the demand be made as soon as practicable, are also not required for the evidentiary shortcuts to apply. This would mean that the Crown would have the benefit of the evidentiary presumptions for any sample, irrespective of the conditions under which the demand was made. The scheme of the legislation is clear: a lawful demand under s.&nbsp;254(3) is a precondition to reliance on s. 258(1)(c) and (g).</p>

Bernshaw</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254. Justice Sopinka, writing for the majority, at para. 51, noted the importance of a statutory precondition being satisfied to ensure a lawful search and seizure, albeit in the context of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec8" target="_blank">s. 8<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>:</p>

Searle</i>, 2006 NBCA 118, 308 N.B.R. (2d) 216.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par94" class="">94</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Searle had appealed, <i>inter alia</i>, that the summary conviction appeal judge erred in finding that the breathalyzer samples were taken lawfully and that the Crown could rely on the presumption found at s. 258. Mr. Searle did not, at trial, seek the exclusion of the certificate of the technician on the grounds of a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>violation. Nevertheless, the court found:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the demand was not made in strict compliance with s. 254(3) of the Code, it is unlawful. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption found in s. 258(1)(c) unless the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand in the first place.&nbsp; Without this presumption, there is no evidence of the concentration of alcohol in the accused’s blood at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed. Thus, the Crown has failed to prove the element of the offence under s. 253(b) of the Code. To summarize: the certificate is still admissible but the prosecutor is not, however, entitled to use the presumption under s. 258(1)(c). The accused must, therefore, be acquitted of the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. [para. 25]</p>

This is in accordance with the principle that this Court may depart from earlier decisions where the earlier decision has been attenuated by later decisions of this Court (<i>R. v.

Specifically, the Crown argues that policy considerations militate in favour of allowing only <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>challenges to exclude certificates of analysis, and that to allow an accused to argue that the evidentiary presumptions are not available absent a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>challenge is to promote “trial by ambush” (<i>Charette</i>, at para. 45). These concerns were referred to in <i>Charette </i>at the Ontario Court of Appeal (see discussion at paras. 44-46). My colleague, Justice Moldaver, in his reasons, also points to policy concerns in overruling <i>Rilling</i>, namely that requiring the Crown to prove the lawfulness of a breath demand before the evidentiary shortcuts apply would frustrate their overriding purpose (paras. 35-36).&nbsp; Of course, none of this detracts from the right of an accused to rely on the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, notably the protections against illegal search and seizure.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par98" class="">98</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In prosecuting “over 80” charges, where the peace officer acted without reasonable grounds, if <i>Rilling</i> is overturned, the Crown will not be able to rely on the evidentiary shortcuts. It will take the Crown longer to prove its case; that follows from not being able to rely on the shortcuts. But it will still be able to prove its case where it has the evidence to do so. Thus, no injustice will arise. The Crown may be inconvenienced, but is it not more important that these provisions of the <i>Code</i> be given their proper meaning and effect? To ask the question is to answer it.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par99" class="">99</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To reverse <i>Rilling </i>is to do no more than affirm that the “reasonable grounds” referred to in s. 254(3) are a precondition for the reliance on the evidentiary presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) and (g). The Crown will simply need to prove the statutory precondition of reasonable grounds. Neither the police nor the Crown should object to conforming to the requirements of the law.</p>

As submitted by the CLA, current procedures, such as disclosure, charge screening and pre-trials, ensure that parties are aware of issues before a trial begins.</p>

What is key is that these issues would be sorted out when the Crown seeks to have the certificate received in evidence. Thus, there would be no “ambush” after the Crown had closed its case. None of this would undermine the statutory scheme. In short, the effects of reversing <i>Rilling </i>would not be those suggested by the Crown.</p>
