Criminal charges of forcible seizure and attempted escape were laid against them. They were transferred to Kent Institution where they were placed, on the Director's oral instructions, in administrative dissociation or segregation, pursuant to s. 40 of the <i>Penitentiary Service Regulations</i>, on the ground that it was necessary for the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution. The Director did not make an independent inquiry into the alleged involvement of the appellants in the hostage‑taking incident but relied on what he had heard from the warden of Matsqui Institution and personnel at regional headquarters. The Segregation Review Board, which reviewed the appellants' segregation monthly in accordance with s. 40 of the Regulations, recommended that they be released from administrative segregation into the general prison population. The Director refused to follow the Board's recommendation on the ground that the appellants' release from segregation before the disposition of the criminal charges pending against them would "probably" or "possibly" introduce an unsettling element into the prison population. The Director did not inform the appellants of his reasons for refusing to follow the Board's recommendation and did not give them an opportunity to be heard as to whether he should act in accordance with the recommendation.</span></p>

McEachern C.J.S.C. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia held that the Court had jurisdiction to issue <i>certiorari</i> in aid of <i>habeas corpus</i>, despite the exclusive jurisdiction by way of <i>certiorari</i> of the Federal Court of Canada under s. 18 of the <i>Federal Court Act</i>, and that <i>habeas corpus</i> would lie to determine the validity of confinement in administrative segregation. On the merits of the applications, he held that the continued segregation of the appellants, despite the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board, had become unlawful because of a breach of the duty of procedural fairness, and he ordered the release of the appellants into the general population of the penitentiary. The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to issue <i>certiorari</i> in aid of <i>habeas corpus</i>, that the Court could on <i>habeas corpus</i> alone consider affidavit evidence to determine whether there had been an absence or excess of jurisdiction, and that <i>habeas corpus</i> would lie to determine the validity of confinement in administrative segregation, but a majority of the Court of Appeal held that the continued segregation of the appellants had not been rendered unlawful by a breach of the duty of procedural fairness. The appeal was accordingly allowed. </span></p>

Miller</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 613, the Court of Appeal correctly concluded (a) that the British Columbia Supreme Court had jurisdiction to issue <i>certiorari</i> in aid of <i>habeas corpus</i>; (b) that the Court could on an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> alone consider affidavit evidence to determine whether there had been an absence or excess of jurisdiction; and (c) that <i>habeas corpus</i> would lie to determine the validity of the confinement of an inmate in administrative dissociation or segregation, and if such confinement be found to be unlawful to order his release into the general population of the institution.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Director was under a duty of procedural fairness in exercising the authority conferred by s. 40 of the Regulations with respect to administrative dissociation or segregation. At common law, a duty of procedural fairness lies on every public authority making an administrative decision which is not of a legislative nature and which affects the rights, privileges or interests of an individual. The duty of procedural fairness has been held to apply in principle to disciplinary proceedings within a penitentiary, and although administrative segregation is distinguished from punitive or disciplinary segregation in the Regulations, the effect on the prisoner is the same and gives rise to the duty to act fairly. The extent to which procedural requirements are imposed in the prison setting must, however, be approached with caution.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original imposition of administrative dissociation or segregation on the appellants was a lawful exercise of the Director's discretionary authority and was not carried out unfairly. In view of the urgent or emergency nature of the decision there could be no requirement of prior notice and hearing. In the case of the Director's decision to continue the appellants' segregation, despite the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board that they be released into the general population of the penitentiary, procedural fairness required that the Director inform the appellants of the reasons for his intended decision and give them an opportunity before him, however informal, to state their case for release. These minimal requirements of procedural fairness were fully compatible with the concern that the process of prison administration, because of its special nature and exigencies, should not be unduly burdened or obstructed by the imposition of unreasonable or inappropriate procedural requirements. </span></p>

The right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent, unqualified right which finds its essential justification in the sense of procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative decision is entitled to have. It is not for a court to deny that right and sense of justice on the basis of speculation as to what the result might have been had there been a hearing.</span></p>

Prisoners in segregation have access to a canteen, but there are limits on what they can purchase. They are paid an allowance (the amount was not specified) at the same grade they were paid before being segregated.

The appellants appeared before the Board. On October 7, 1980 the Board recommended to the Director that the appellants be returned to normal association with the general prison population. The Director declined to follow this recommendation. In its subsequent reviews of the appellants' case the Board maintained its favourable recommendation, but the Director continued to hold them in segregation. At the time their applications for <i>habeas corpus</i> with <i>certiorari</i> in aid were heard in November 1980, they had been in segregation for some four months, and the indication was that the Director would likely continue the segregation until disposition of the criminal charges against them.</span></p>

He had decided not to follow the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board because, while he accepted its favourable opinion of the appellants' conduct in Kent Institution, he believed that their release from segregation before the disposition of the criminal charges against them would result in the "probable" or "possible" introduction of an unsettling element into the general population of the institution and was therefore not in the interests of the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution. He could not point to a specific reason for holding this belief but based it on his personal assessment of the "dynamics" of the institution, a judgment which he referred to at one point as an "instinctive reaction" and con­ceded at another point could be described as a "gut reaction". He indicated that the primary consideration underlying his decision was the seriousness of the hostage‑taking incident in which the appellants were alleged to have been involved, and he could not point to any factor that would be likely to change his decision before the question of their involvement had been clarified by disposition of the criminal charges. It was not for him to determine that question when it was before the courts. </span></p>

They were further agreed that in exercising the authority conferred by s. 40 of the regulations with respect to administrative segregation the Director had a duty of procedural fairness, but a majority of the Court (Nemetz C.J.B.C. and Macdonald J.A.), Anderson J.A. dissenting, held that there had not been a breach of that duty.

Miller</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 613, which was heard at the same time as this appeal, I agree with the conclusions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal expressed in the reasons of Anderson J.A., with whom Nemetz C.J. and Macdonald J.A. concurred, on the three issues concerning the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Supreme Court: (a) that the Court had jurisdiction to issue <i>certiorari</i> in aid of <i>habeas corpus</i>; (b) that the Court could on an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> alone consider affidavit evidence to determine whether there had been an absence or excess of jurisdiction; and (c) that <i>habeas corpus</i> will lie to determine the validity of the confinement of an inmate in administrative segregation, and if such confinement be found to be unlawful, to order his release into the general inmate population of the institution. There is no significant difference, in so far as the last question is concerned, between confinement in administrative dissociation or segregation, pursuant to s. 40(1) of the <i>Penitentiary Service Regulations</i>, and confinement in a special handling unit, as in <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>. Both are significantly more restrictive and severe forms of detention than that experienced by the general inmate population. Indeed, as indi­cated in the reasons for judgment in <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, Commissioner's Directive 274 of December 1, 1980 provides that phase 1 of confinement in a special handling unit shall consist of a period of assessment in administrative segregation.</span></p>

This Court has affirmed that there is, as a general common law principle, a duty of procedural fairness lying on every public authority making an administrative decision which is not of a legislative nature and which affects the rights, privileges or interests of an individual: <i>Nicholson v. Haldimand‑Norfolk Regional Board of Commissioners of Police</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 311; <i>Martineau v. Matsqui Institution Disciplinary Board (No. 2)</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602; <i>Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735. In <i>Martineau (No. 2)</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Court held that the duty of procedural fairness applied in principle to disciplinary proceedings within a penitentiary. Although administrative segregation is distinguished from punitive or disciplinary segregation under s. 40 of the <i>Penitentiary Service Regulations</i>, its effect on the inmate in either case is the same and is such as to give rise to a duty to act fairly. </span></p>

The caution with which this question must be approached in the context of prison administration was emphasized by this Court in <i>Martineau (No. 2)</i>, <i>supra</i>. Pigeon J., with whom Martland, Ritchie, Beetz, Estey and Pratte JJ. concurred, said at p. 637:</span></p>

This is subject to the exercise of judicial discretion and in this respect it will be essential that the requirements of prison discipline be borne in mind, just as it is essential that the requirements of the effective administration of criminal justice be borne in mind when dealing with applications for <i>certiorari</i> before trial, as pointed out in <i>Attorney General of Quebec v. Cohen</i> ([1979] 2 S.C.R. 305). It is specially important that the remedy be granted only in cases of serious injustice and that proper care be taken to prevent such proceedings from being used to delay deserved punishment so long that it is made ineffective, if not altogether avoided.</span></p>

The very nature of a prison institution requires officers to make "on the spot" disciplinary decisions and the power of judicial review must be exercised with restraint. Interference will not be justified in the case of trivial or merely technical incidents. The question is not whether there has been a breach of the prison rules, but whether there has been a breach of the duty to act fairly in all the circumstances. The rules are of some importance in determining this latter question, as an indication of the views of prison authorities as to the degree of procedural protection to be extended to inmates.</span></p>

That conclusion was not seriously challenged on the appeal, and, indeed, it would not appear to be open to challenge.

McEachern C.J.S.C. also held that there was an appearance of unfairness in the apparently closed mind of the Director on the question of whether the segregation should be continued despite the favourable recommendation of the Board, and even a suggestion that the segregation was being continued in an attempt to force the appellants to plead guilty to the criminal charges pending against them. He said that the Director was required to make an independent inquiry into the circumstances of the hostage‑taking incident, to examine the appellants' files and to ascertain whether the continuation of the segregation was impairing their ability to instruct counsel, as they claimed.

Although the director's function is essentially administrative in nature, he is given broad powers under s. 40 of the regulations. He is not burdened with any standards or guidelines in the exercise of his power to order that inmate be dissociated. Procedural standards have not been imposed or implied. He must have enough latitude to respond to the requirements of prison security as he sees fit. This is especially so in cases of violence such as hostage‑taking.</span></p>

Was he justified in doing so? I think he was. The seriousness of the incident and the circumstances surrounding it, as well as the situation in his prison generally, played an important part in his determination. The classification board's view related primarily to the assessment of the behaviour of the two prisoners while in dissociation. However, the director had to also consider his responsibilities in regard to the proper operation and security of the whole institution. In my view, unless mala fides or unfairness can be shown, his assessment should prevail. No mala fides has been shown. Any procedural unfairness, if it exists, is not of sufficient substance to cause me to conclude that the director acted outside of his jurisdiction. </span></p>

The petitioners would know that they were in dissociation at Kent because of the incident at the Matsqui Institution in which they were alleged to have taken a guard hostage at knifepoint. When they first appeared before the Classification Board in July, they were expressly informed that they had been placed in dissociation because of that incident. Now, there are many factors favourable to the petitioners. They weighed with the Classification Board and resulted in the recommendation in October that they be returned to the general prison population. But they did not prevail with the director. He did not decide in accordance with the recommendation. It was not a case of a decision made under the influence, or possible influence, of material unknown to the two inmates. The director was extensively cross‑examined as to his reasons. He pointed out that the Classification Board was concerned with the two individuals, whereas his responsibility was the operation of the whole institution. He said that he was concerned about the seriousness of the incident in which the two men had been involved; the effect of the unresolved allegations and the situation generally on the inmate population, including the violent element; and the factor of deterrence. Weighing the factors, the director decided upon continued dissociation. I can find no procedural unfairness. I think the essence of the complaints here is with respect to the decision itself rather than the circumstances in which it was made. I am of the opinion that the director acted within his jurisdiction.</span></p>

After referring to the cautions expressed in <i>Martineau (No. 2)</i>, <i>supra</i>, concerning the application of procedural requirements in a prison setting, he said:</span></p>

While the respondent was not entitled to a full hearing or to confront witnesses or to counsel, at the very least he ought to have been given an opportunity to make representations as to why he should no longer be kept in solitary confinement.

They should not have had to make out their case to a mind that was closed or almost closed against them. To continue their segregation in the face of the recommendation of the review board in the particular circumstances of this case raises a reasonable apprehension that they should plead guilty which, by itself is enough to cast a pervasive appearance of unfairness over these cases. In addition, although a decision based upon a policy (such as one for prisoners who are awaiting trial or for prisoners who have taken a hostage) may be perfectly lawful, fairness requires timely reconsideration of the particular circumstances of each prisoner and individual whose residual rights and privileges are adversely being affected." </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue then is what did procedural fairness require of the Director in exercising his authority, pursuant to s. 40 of the <i>Penitentiary Service Regulations</i>, to continue the administrative dissociation or segregation of the appellants, despite the recommendation of the Board, if he was satisfied that it was necessary or desirable for the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution. I agree with McEachern C.J.S.C. and Anderson J.A. that because of the serious effect of the Director's decision on the appellants, procedural fairness required that he inform them of the reasons for his intended decision and give them an opportunity, however informal, to make representations to him concerning these reasons and the general question whether it was necessary or desirable to continue their segregation for the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution. With great respect, I do not think it is an answer to the requirement of notice and hearing by the Director, as suggested by Macdonald J.A., that the appellants knew as a result of their appearance before the Segregation Review Board why they had been placed in segregation. They were entitled to know why the Director did not intend to act in accordance with the recommendation of the Board and to have an opportunity before him to state their case for release into the general population of the institution. I do not think the Director was required to make an independent inquiry into the alleged involvement of the appellants in the hostage‑taking&nbsp;incident. He could rely on the information he had received concerning the incident from the warden of Matsqui Institution and the personnel at regional headquarters. At the same time, he had a duty to hear and consider what the appellants had to say concerning their alleged involvement in the incident, as well as anything else that could be relevant to the question whether their release from segregation might introduce an unsettling element into the general inmate population and thus have an adverse effect on the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were in my opinion the minimal or essential requirements of procedural fairness in the circumstances, and they are fully compatible with the concern that the process of prison administration, because of its special nature and exigencies, should not be unduly burdened or obstructed by the imposition of unreasonable or inappropriate procedural requirements. There is nothing to suggest that the requirement of notice and hearing by the Director, where he does not intend to act in accordance with a recommendation by the Segregation Review Board for the release of an inmate from segregation, would impose an undue burden on prison administration or create a risk to security.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is the question, suggested by the reasons for judgment of Nemetz C.J.B.C., whether the breach of the duty to act fairly in this case should be held not to have resulted in an excess or loss of jurisdiction and to have made the continuing segregation of the appellants unlawful because, having regard to the merits of the substantive issue, it did not result in a substantial injustice, or to use the words of Nemetz C.J.B.C., was not of "sufficient substance". Both Nemetz C.J.B.C. and Macdonald J.A. considered the substantive issue of whether the appellants should be released from segregation and appeared to conclude that the Director's reasons for refusing to follow the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board were reasonable and fair. It is a possible implication of their approach that they were of the view that given the Director's reasons for refusing to follow the recommendation of the Board a hearing by him of the appellants would not serve any useful purpose. Certainly a failure to afford a fair hearing, which is the very essence of the duty to act fairly, can never of itself be regarded as not of "sufficient substance" unless it be because of its perceived effect on the result or, in other words, the actual prejudice caused by it. If this be a correct view of the implications of the approach of the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal to the issue of procedural fairness in this case, I find it necessary to affirm that the denial of a right to a fair hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different decision. The right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent, unqualified right which finds its essential justification in the sense of procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative decision is entitled to have. It is not for a court to deny that right and sense of justice on the basis of speculation as to what the result might have been had there been a hearing.</span></p>

They, therefore, had a right on <i>habeas corpus</i> to be released from administrative dissociation or segregation into the general population of the penitentiary. I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of McEachern C.J.S.C. </span></p>
