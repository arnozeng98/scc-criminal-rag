This should be taken into account in considering the validity of a given tax by reference to its incidence.&nbsp; The type of taxes the framers of the Constitution contemplated as direct taxes, land taxes for example, were seen to have predominantly local impact, while those seen as indirect, such as customs and excise, had an obvious tendency to have extraterritorial impact.&nbsp; Moreover, s.&nbsp;92(2) expressly limited provincial taxes to the province and the limitation to direct taxation has prevented provinces from doing indirectly what they could not do directly. This approach is wholly consistent with the basic structure of the Constitution.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The framers of the Constitution considered that certain well-known categories of taxes would fall into the rubric of either direct or indirect taxes.&nbsp; The Mill’s test, which was seen as being a refinement of the idea underlying the earlier categories approach, where certain taxes were categorized as being either direct or indirect, defined a direct tax as one demanded from the very person who it is intended or desired should pay it and an indirect tax as one demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that that person indemnify him‑ or herself at the expense of another.&nbsp; While never abandoning the “categories approach”, the courts have moved to Mill’s test when dealing with taxes that did not fit comfortably with the few categories specifically adverted to by the framers.&nbsp; Mill’s test was found to permit the courts greater flexibility in accommodating the competing policies of according the provinces ample power to tax ‑‑ necessary to provide provinces with sufficient means to finance their legislative activities, which quickly turned out to be much more expensive than expected in 1867 ‑‑ while restraining them to their territorial scope. Thus, while EDCs might be indirect within the meaning of the definition proposed by Mill, ignoring the fact that they are land taxes ‑‑ the impact of which can only be confined to the territory of Ontario ‑‑ would disregard the important constitutional policies underlying the limitation to direct taxation provided for in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec92" target="_blank">s. 92<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</p>

E.2, is factored in, in order to determine the net growth-related education capital cost that will flow from development.&nbsp; A certain percentage of this cost will be paid through EDCs in respect of commercial development.&nbsp; The commercial contribution is calculated by dividing the percentage of growth-related cost that is to be covered by commercial EDCs by the declared value of the commercial building permits issued during the term of the EDC by-law, and multiplying the quotient by 100 to express the EDC on commercial development as a percentage of declared value.</p>

[T]the property must be assessed without regard to exploration, production or any transactions".&nbsp; McKeown J. stated at p. 510 that:</p>

13.7pt;line-height:24.4pt">The form of the words used in s. 30 of the <i>Development Charges Act</i>, "land undergoing development", cannot change the real purpose of the tax which is a tax directed at the ultimate purchaser of a building or edifice.&nbsp; It cannot be a property tax just because the municipality has the same collection rights against the property when the education development charge is not paid as it has against arrears in property taxes.&nbsp; Thus this is not a property tax.</p>

(McKinlay and Goodman JJ.A. concurring) first dealt with the issue of standing.&nbsp; He found that the respondents (the appellants in the appeal before this Court) had standing to argue that the legislation in question amounted to unconstitutional indirect taxation.&nbsp; He noted that two of the respondents would face EDCs they should not have to pay if the EDC scheme were beyond provincial powers.&nbsp; With respect to the respondents' standing to argue the s. 93 proportionality issue, Carthy J.A. commented at p. 107 that the respondents' "sole interest is in the EDC and their obligation to pay it".&nbsp; After reviewing the relevant principles, as articulated in <i>Hy and Zel's Inc. v.

P.13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carthy J.A. stated that EDCs are imposed on land based on the number of housing units to be produced or based on the value of commercial buildings.&nbsp; While the charges are payable at the building permit stage, Carthy J.A. remarked at p. 109, that "[i]n many cases homes will be pre-sold at this stage, suggesting the likelihood that the charges will be passed on as part of the price of the lot and building".&nbsp; He also found it significant that the funds raised by the EDCs are placed in a bank account in the names of both school boards and can only be paid out to fund school construction approved by the Minister of Education.&nbsp; Carthy J.A. commented at pp. 109-10 as follows:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
13.7pt;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, the same reasoning applies to the EDCs.&nbsp; They are imposed on land and some authorities could be called forth to say they are, on that account, direct taxes.&nbsp; Yet, the reality is that the charges are imposed as a fee for constructing buildings for sale.&nbsp; The amount charged relates to the number of units, or value in the case of commercial development, and common sense therefore says that the tendency will be to pass the cost along.</p>

Attorney-General for Ontario</i>, is not what is the distinction drawn by writers on political economy, but in what sense the words were employed in the British North America Act.&nbsp; Mill's Political Economy was first published in 1848, and appeared in a popular edition in 1865.&nbsp; Its author became a member of parliament in this latter year and commanded much attention in the British House of Commons.&nbsp; Having regard to his eminence as a political economist in the epoch when the Quebec Resolutions were being discussed and the Act of 1867 was being framed, the use of Mill's analysis and classification of taxes for the purpose of construing the expression now under review is fully justified.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">There can be no doubt that by the words "direct and indirect taxation" the Fathers of Confederation contemplated certain distinct categories of taxation, as well as a general test of directness.&nbsp; Only certain of such categories, such as income and property taxes, were to be available to the Legislatures.&nbsp; There were two reasons for this.&nbsp; The first was based on arcane political economy.&nbsp; It was thought that a direct tax would be more perceived than an indirect tax.&nbsp; The effect was thought to provide for greater scrutiny and resistence by the electorate with a resulting parsimony in public expenditure.&nbsp; The second reason proved wrong from the start.&nbsp; It was thought that provincial activities would be limited and revenue needs would be slim;&nbsp; the Legislatures, therefore, would have no necessity to resort to most tax pools.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The functions and responsibilities assigned to the provinces, though important, were not costly.&nbsp; The maintenance of a civil government, the administration of justice, education, local works and undertakings, welfare -- all these involved modest expenditures in 1867, and it was anticipated they would remain fairly static.&nbsp; The vast responsibilities now exercised by government in these fields could not be foreseen in the laissez faire era.&nbsp; In consequence the sources of revenue made available to the provinces under the Confederation agreements were either restricted or unattractive.&nbsp; The major sources of provincial revenue, in fact, were not intended to be taxation.&nbsp; Provision was made for payment of subsidies by the federal government to the provinces which, in the early years of Confederation, comprised nearly half the provincial revenues.&nbsp; Moreover, the public domain, excluding such items as canals, public harbours, railroads, military lands, and other assets required for the performance of federal functions, remained to the provinces.&nbsp; It was only as a last resort that the provinces were expected to levy taxation; and to curb any inclination the legislatures might have to embark on overly ambitious schemes, the major taxes allocated to them were the unpopular direct taxes.&nbsp; Any expansion of provincial governmental expenditures, it was thought, could be met by increased returns from the public domain.&nbsp; Thus Galt in discussing the sources of provincial revenues under the Quebec Resolutions had this to say:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:113.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-34.55pt;line-height:24.4pt">We may, however, place just confidence in the development of our resources, and repose in the belief that we shall find in our territorial domain, our valuable mines and our fertile lands, additional sources of revenue far beyond the requirements of the public service.&nbsp; If, nevertheless, the local revenues become inadequate, it will be necessary for the local governments to have resort to direct taxation; and I do not hesitate to say that one of the wisest provisions in the proposed Constitution, and that which affords the surest guarantee that the people will take a healthy interest in their own affairs and see that no extravagance is committed by those placed in power over them, is to be found in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fact that those who are called upon to administer public affairs will feel, when they resort to direct taxation, that a solemn responsibility rests upon them, and that that responsibility will be exacted by the people in the most peremptory manner.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Reference to contemporary sources shows that the meaning of direct taxation, even during the period of Confederation, was quite broad, including in addition to property taxes, death duties and income taxes.&nbsp; It was not because of its narrow scope that politicians underrated direct taxation.&nbsp; It was because they felt that politically it would be extremely difficult to impose; hardly anything comes out more clearly in the debates of the legislatures of the time than the extreme unpopularity of direct taxation.&nbsp; Such taxes, as the name implies, are those imposed on the taxpayer directly, as compared with indirect taxation like customs duties which are concealed from the taxpayer in the price of some commodity or service.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">Why does s. 92(2) limit the provinces to direct taxation?&nbsp; The answer is that the limitation is a corollary to the general principle, discussed later in this chapter, that provincial taxing powers (like other provincial legislative powers) are confined to the territory of the province.&nbsp; The leading feature of an indirect tax is, as we have noticed, that it is likely to be passed on by the initial taxpayer through the incorporation of the tax into the price of goods or services provided by the initial taxpayer.&nbsp; What this means is that a tax that is initially levied on a taxpayer within the province could ultimately be borne by a consumer outside the province.&nbsp; If that occurred, the province would be taxing a person to whom it provided no governmental benefits and to whom it was not accountable.&nbsp; This result is avoided if the province is restricted to direct taxation, where the initial taxpayer within the province is also the person who ultimately bears the tax.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">As noticed earlier, even a direct tax will be circuitously recouped if it forms part of the overhead of a business.&nbsp; But it is obviously neither possible nor desirable to exclude from the provincial taxing power all taxes that are in fact recouped by the initial taxpayer.&nbsp; The test of directness is a justiciable means of excluding from provincial power at least those taxes that are most likely to be passed on, and thereby confining provincial power to those taxes the burden of which is most likely to remain within the province.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Professor La Forest comments, at pp. 111-12 as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The limitation of the provinces under section 92(2) of the British North America Act to taxation "within the Province" has served the important function of dividing the available tax resources among the provinces.&nbsp; Perhaps the first point to note is that while a tax is, of course, always paid by a person, the limitation does not restrict the provinces to taxing persons in the province.&nbsp; A province may also levy taxes on property or transactions or benefits acquired in the province, so long as the taxes are direct.&nbsp; In such cases it is irrelevant that the tax may be borne by a person outside the province.&nbsp; Thus, no one has ever questioned the constitutional validity of ordinary municipal rates on real estate on the ground that a landowner (upon whom the tax will in practice usually fall) resides outside the province.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">Though a province may impose taxes on persons, property, transactions, and benefits in the province, they must of course be properly framed to reach out to the permissible limits.&nbsp; Thus, a tax on a person, income, property, or transaction outside the province is invalid; but a tax on a person in the province in respect of his income or other benefit received outside the province, and a tax on income or property in the province owned by a nonresident are valid.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Professor La Forest also observes at p. 113 that:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">It will be obvious from the foregoing that a taxpayer may, in practise, be taxed by several provinces in respect of the same economic interest.&nbsp; The courts could, of course, have held that a tax measured by an extraprovincial standard was in substance a tax on an asset in another province.&nbsp; But they have shown no disposition to police the provinces in this way and have left it to the legislatures to judge the soundness, wisdom or expediency of taxing measures.&nbsp; Only when a provincial tax amounts in substance to a regulation of a federal matter will the courts intervene.&nbsp; Mutual restraint based on political or economic considerations or interprovincial arrangements have, however, been sufficient until now to prevent the problem of multiple taxation from becoming acute.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">...the court in <i>Colpitts</i> seems to suggest that an indirect tax involves a perfect correlation between a tax and the increased cost of a commercial item.&nbsp; I do not believe that the helpful approach of the <i>Saskatchewan</i> case is rendered sterile simply because certain units of a taxed commodity do not reach the market.&nbsp; While the tax imposed with reference to such units may indeed be absorbed into general "production costs", that does not prevent the tax from clinging as a burden to the vast majority of units which end up entering the market.&nbsp; To the extent that <i>Colpitts</i> denies this proposition, I would overrule it.</p>

13.7pt;line-height:24.4pt">Modern economic analysis has largely stripped Mill's distinction of meaning.&nbsp; But the courts have not abandoned it on that account.&nbsp; This has not been necessary because in their hands it is a legal, rather than an economic tool.&nbsp; From the beginning the Privy Council made it clear that its task was not to follow the burden of a tax in the manner of economists but to construe the term "direct taxation" as used in the British North America Act.&nbsp; Mill's definition as used by the courts required that the general incidence of a tax should be established in accordance with the general understanding of men, not its actual effect as traced by economists.&nbsp; Thus, a customs duty was in their view a classic instance of an indirect tax, since its general tendency was to be passed along, and it was nonetheless an indirect tax though private bargains or market conditions might compel importers to pay it themselves.</p>

24.4pt">...their Lordships have primarily to consider... whether [the business tax] is in its nature a direct tax within the meaning of s. 92, head 2, of the Act of Union.&nbsp; The framers of that Act evidently regarded taxes as divisible into two separate and distinct categories -- namely, those that are direct and those which cannot be so described, and it is to taxation of the former character only that the powers of a Provincial government are made to extend.&nbsp; From this it is to be inferred that the distinction between direct and indirect taxes was well known before the passing of the Act; and it is undoubtedly the fact that before that date the classification was familiar to statesmen as well as to economists, and that certain taxes were then universally recognized as falling within one or the other category.&nbsp; Thus, taxes on property or income were everywhere treated as direct taxes; and John Stuart Mill himself, following Adam Smith, Ricardo and James Mill, said that a tax on rents falls wholly on the landlord and cannot be transferred to any one else.&nbsp; "It merely takes so much from the landlord and transfers it to the State" (Political Economy, vol. ii., p. 416).&nbsp; On the other hand, duties of customs and excise were regarded by every one as typical instances of indirect taxation.&nbsp; When therefore the Act of Union allocated the power of direct taxation for Provincial purposes to the Province, it must surely have intended that the taxation, for those purposes, of property and income should belong exclusively to the Provincial legislatures, and that without regard to any theory as to the ultimate incidence of such taxation.&nbsp; To hold otherwise would be to suppose that the framers of the Act intended to impose on a Provincial legislature the task of speculating as to the probable ultimate incidence of each particular tax which it might desire to impose, at the risk of having such tax held invalid if the conclusion reached should afterwards be held to be wrong.</p>

13.7pt;line-height:24.4pt">What then is the effect to be given to Mill's formula above quoted?&nbsp; No doubt it is valuable as providing a logical basis for the distinction already established between direct and indirect taxes, and perhaps also as a guide for determining as to any new or unfamiliar tax which may be imposed in which of the two categories it is to be placed; but it cannot have the effect of disturbing the established classification of the old and well known species of taxation, and making it necessary to apply a new test to every particular member of those species.&nbsp; The imposition of taxes on property and income, of death duties and of municipal and local rates is, according to the common understanding of the term, direct taxation, just as the exaction of a customs or excise duty on commodities or of a percentage duty on services would ordinarily be regarded as indirect taxation; and although new forms of taxation may from time to time be added to one category or the other in accordance with Mill's formula, it would be wrong to use that formula as a ground for transferring a tax universally recognized as belonging to one class to a different class of taxation.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In a sense, EDCs are imposed in the course of manufacture on the commodity to be sold, that is, the new house or building.&nbsp; Most of the charge payers, the majority of whom are developers, intend to trade in the commodity, that is to sell the newly constructed buildings.&nbsp; It follows, in my view, that EDCs cling as a burden to new buildings when they are brought to market.&nbsp; Accordingly, EDCs constitute indirect taxation and are <i>ultra vires</i> provincial competence under s. 92(2).</p>

Greater Hull School Board</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 575, that the right of dissentient schools in Quebec to a proportionate share of government funding was a right protected by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec93" target="_blank">s. 93<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Likewise, in my view, the right of separate schools in Ontario.&nbsp; They were entitled to the proportionate funding provided for in s. 20 of the <i>Scott Act</i>.&nbsp; This conclusion, it seems to me, is fully consistent with the clear purpose of s. 93, namely that the denominational minority's interest in a separate but suitable education for its children be protected into the future.</p>

 <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">72&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if EDCs could be characterized as "grants", it should be noted that s. 20 has never applied to capital grants.&nbsp; As the respondents have submitted, "[t]he concept of equal per pupil local grants measured on an annual basis cannot be applied sensibly to capital grants for assets that are to be used over a number of years.&nbsp; It would be absurd to require the Province to fund the construction of an unneeded separate school simply because the local public school board needed and received provincial funding for a new school".&nbsp; The current education funding model in Ontario is in one sense inconsistent with s. 20 of the <i>Scott Act</i> in that it operates on a provincial, rather than on a local basis to provide equal per pupil resources for a base level of education services, and in that it only considers local assessment wealth in fixing grants, but not the grant level enjoyed by the coterminous school board.&nbsp; However, recent jurisprudence, including <i>Greater Montreal Protestant School Board v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 377, at p. 402, has continued to emphasize that a formalistic interpretation of s. 93(1) may not in fact protect the substance of the guarantee contained therein:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">It is true that the rights or privileges under ordinary law to which s. 93(1) refers have been frozen at Confederation.&nbsp; But just like the basic provincial power which, as Viscount Cave explained, was not "stereotyped" at the Union, the exception to that power has also matured over time through judicial interpretation.&nbsp; The approach courts have taken to the interpretation of the expression "with respect to Denominational Schools" in cases such as <i>Hull</i>, <i>supra</i>, ... demonstrates that the law in force "at the Union" cannot on its own set the content of the constitutional rights in s. 93(1).</p>

Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction</i>, [1931] S.C.R. 357.&nbsp; But more importantly, the division between the provincial taxing powers and other legislative powers is at the origin of the provincial power to levy what have come to be known as "regulatory charges".&nbsp; The courts have recognized that in certain circumstances a provincial levy may relate, in pith and substance, to the regulation of an activity falling within exclusive provincial legislative jurisdiction, and that such levy would not be subject to the requirement of directness provided for in s. 92(2), which can in all logic only apply to legislation enacted under the specific head of power provided for in s. 92(2), taxation.&nbsp; It will become obvious that differentiating a tax from a regulatory charge is ‑‑ as is so often the case in cases dealing with distribution of powers ‑‑ no easy task.&nbsp; But one thing seems clear from the sharp division made between regulation and taxation (and for good policy reasons) by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The framers of the Constitution could not have intended by the simple grant of a regulatory power to have intended to in effect empower the imposition of a tax, an issue that will be given detailed attention later.</p>

Coquitlam (District)</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 371.&nbsp; The obvious justification for this is that the debate regarding major provincial levies is more appropriately channelled to the major taxation provision intended by the framers to empower the provinces to levy a revenue, s. 92(2).&nbsp; The limitation to direct taxation is better geared to balance the tension between the policies of giving the provinces, consistent with their heavy responsibilities, the widest possible scope for raising necessary revenues while supporting the national and structural requirements I have earlier described.</p>

However, in the early 1930s the higher courts were again faced with the issue in a series of cases dealing with the constitutionality of levies imposed by the provinces in connection with marketing schemes.&nbsp; The first is <i>Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; There the respondent committee had been given the exclusive power to control and regulate the impugned marketing scheme, which included the power to impose on certain producers and shippers levies “for the purpose of defraying the expenses of operation” of the scheme, which were indirect in their incidence.&nbsp; The whole scheme was eventually struck down by this Court because in pith and substance it related to extraprovincial trade and commerce, a matter within exclusive federal legislative authority under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec91subsec2" target="_blank">s. 91(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; However, Duff J., as he then was, writing for the majority, did address the appellant’s argument relating to the nature of the levies.&nbsp; He characterized them as “taxes” according to four criteria (later generally accepted by the courts), namely:&nbsp; they were (a) enforceable by law, (b) imposed under the authority of the legislature, (c) levied by a public body and (d) intended for a public purpose.&nbsp; He then considered whether the levies could be characterized as having been enacted under the provincial power relating to licences under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en#!fragment/sec92subsec9" target="_blank">s. 92(9)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; He had this to say, at pp. 363-64:</p>

Crystal Dairy, Ltd.</i>, [1933] A.C. 168 (P.C.), in which the constitutionality of a complex regulatory regime relating to the British Columbia milk market was at issue.&nbsp; A provincial statute provided for the creation of an Adjustment Committee which was responsible for imposing on farmers selling fluid milk a volumetric fee eventually redistributed to the farmers who had sold milk products (an “adjustment levy”).&nbsp; The general tendency of the fee was, of course, to be passed along to consumers, and it was, therefore, held to be indirect.&nbsp; The Adjustment Committee was also given the power to impose another type of fee to meet the expenses incurred in the administration of the scheme (an “expenses levy”).&nbsp; At p. 174, the Privy Council held that the substance of the scheme was “to transfer compulsorily a portion of the returns obtained by the traders in the fluid milk market”.&nbsp; The appellant's main argument was that such levies fell within exclusive provincial legislative jurisdiction under ss. 92(13) (property and civil rights) and 92(16) (matters of a merely local or private nature in the province).&nbsp; The Privy Council rejected both arguments.&nbsp; It first held, at p. 175, that the adjustment levy was a tax according to the criteria laid down by Duff J. in <i>Lawson</i>.&nbsp; It arrived at the same conclusion with respect to the expenses levy since it was, in their Lordships’ opinion, ancillary to the adjustment levy.&nbsp; The Privy Council did not specifically address the issue of whether either levy could be supported under another head of power, as the appellant had argued.&nbsp; In this respect, the correctness of its conclusion was subsequently questioned (see Professor Bora Laskin, as he then was, “Provincial Marketing Levies: Indirect Taxation and Federal Power” (1959), <i>U. of T.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In order to determine the true pith and substance of the impugned enactment, it seems requisite to ascertain into which slot the bylaw falls, and this, in turn, involves consideration of the circumstances surrounding its enactment.&nbsp; The facts can be shortly summarized into two principal categories.&nbsp; The first is that the removal of gravel and other substances from the eight or nine quarries or gravel pits in the Municipality by a continuous train of ten-ton trucks raised not only the displeasure of the inhabitants in the affected neighbourhoods, but past and prospective outlays of large sums of public funds for road provision and maintenance as well as regulatory expenses.&nbsp; The second, the other side of the coin, is that 15¢ imposed by way of permit fee for each cubic yard removed creates a heavy burden on permit holders, and greatly increases their costs of doing business.&nbsp; It comes down to a fee of one dollar for each loaded ten-ton truck removing gravel away from the pits through the appellant’s thorough-fares.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The bylaw being amended constitutes a complete and detailed code for the regulation of the gravel and soil extraction and removal trade, including the provision of the performance bonds and operational plans and surveys, obviously directed to safety and environmental control.&nbsp; In the light of the public problems and expenses resulting from the extended operation of the business in the Municipality, I am unable to conclude that the amending bylaw No. 2041, 1971, although completely changing, as it does, the basis of the permit fee and increasing it enormously, has become divorced from the licensing and regulatory concept and, in effect, has become a disguised taxation of an indirect nature.&nbsp; In my view, heavy as the fee may be, the levy is still ancillary and incidental, and intended so to be, to the regulatory licensing of a trade or business.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">As was the case in <i>Allard</i>, the fee discussed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>LaFarge</i> formed an integral part of a legislative scheme aimed at regulating the gravel removing business in pursuance of various policy goals to the point where it had no integrity of its own, taking its “colour from the scheme” itself, to use Laskin C.J.’s words in <i>Reference re Agricultural Products Marketing Act</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 1234.</p>

Land Settlement Board</i>, [1929] S.C.R. 52, at p. 73; and <i>Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan</i>, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 231, at pp. 258-59.&nbsp; I have found no authority to support the other requirements added by my colleague Iacobucci J.&nbsp; While the best known examples of land taxes are the ordinary municipal rates and taxes, they are by no means confined to these, and a wide variety of taxes have been held to be taxes on land because they were imposed on land or its owner, whatever their ultimate incidence might be thought to be.</p>

Attorney General for Saskatchewan</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Saskatchewan<i> Mineral Taxation Act, 1948</i>, S.S. 1948, c. 24, which imposed a tax on minerals in producing areas of the province at a rate based on the fair market value of the minerals, was held valid as a land tax.&nbsp; Again, in <i>R. v. Churchill</i> (1972), 29 D.L.R. (3d) 368 (B.C.S.C.), McIntyre J., later of this Court, held that a fee imposed on operators of mobile home parks calculated in terms of the number of units in a park was a tax on land and so historically a direct tax.&nbsp; That fee would clearly have a tendency to be passed on to the unit holders.&nbsp; It can scarcely be said, as my colleague does, that these are "traditional" land taxes.&nbsp; As in the present case, they are based on specific uses of the land that make it very likely that the taxes will be recouped by the landowner against others.&nbsp; Indeed, in all the cases I have examined, taxes against land or its owner have invariably been held to be direct.&nbsp; This approach was most recently confirmed by this Court in <i>Canadian Industrial Gas &amp; Oil Ltd.</i>, <i>supra</i>.

Attorney-General of British Columbia</i>, [1960] S.C.R. 713.&nbsp; The impact on interprovincial and international trade, and the extraterritorial implications generally, of such commodity taxes are obvious, a point that I find is telling, and I shall expand on it later.&nbsp; At this stage, I simply observe that that is not the case here; the burden of a land tax cannot be passed on to persons operating outside the province.&nbsp; I note parenthetically that I am using the word “commodity” here in its ordinary commercial sense of articles of trade (see <i>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English</i> (9th ed. 1995)) as it has invariably been used in this area of law, as contrasted with land; see, for example, <i>Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v.

The first was based on arcane political economy.&nbsp; It was thought that a direct tax would be more perceived than an indirect tax.&nbsp; The effect was thought to provide for greater scrutiny and resistence by the electorate with a resulting parsimony in public expenditure.&nbsp; The second reason proved wrong from the start.&nbsp; It was thought that provincial activities would be limited and revenue needs would be slim; the Legislatures, therefore, would have no necessity to resort to most tax pools.</span></p>

Queen Insurance Co.</i> (1878), 3 A.C. 1090 (P.C.).&nbsp; However, the courts did not confine themselves to these broad understandings but consulted the works of various economists whose works must have been familiar to the framers.&nbsp; Preeminent among these was John Stuart Mill, and beginning with the case of <i>Bank of Toronto v. Lambe</i>, <i>supra</i>, his formulation of the concepts was for a considerable period almost exclusively referred to.&nbsp; In <i>Principles of Political Economy</i>, <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; Mill wrote:</span></p>

Shruti"> 1.&nbsp; Taxes are either direct or indirect.&nbsp; A direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who, it is intended or desired, should pay it.&nbsp; Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another:&nbsp; such as the excise or customs.&nbsp; The producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it, not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him, but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity, from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price.</span></p>

The King</i>, [1914] A.C. 176 (P.C.), it was categorically stated that the test to be used was substantially that of Mill and that test was generally regarded as the sole test until the late 1920s.&nbsp; It must be observed, however, that the courts were then engaged in dealing with new types of taxes that did not fit, or fit comfortably, within the few categories specifically adverted to by the framers.&nbsp; It would have been possible, no doubt, to invent new categories.&nbsp; But it was quite natural to rely on more refined formulations familiar to the framers, and notably those of Mill, as they had from the beginning.&nbsp; As the provinces</span>’<span style="font-family:Shruti"> needs for revenues expanded, the courts responded favourably to the fiscal necessity this imposed on them.&nbsp; At the same time, it was essential that they confine the provinces</span>’<span style="font-family:Shruti"> fiscal power as much as possible within their territory, as the broad categories of taxation contemplated by the framers had done.</span></p>

Shruti">s case, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; Placing all estate taxes in a single category would have brought the underlying policies of the courts into conflict.&nbsp; However, by using Mill's test to trace the incidence of a particular taxing scheme, the courts could work an accommodation between these policies.&nbsp; Thus a tax imposed on a beneficiary in the province (what we now call succession duty) was imposed directly on the taxpayer and would have no extraprovincial effect, so it was held to be a direct tax; see <i>Alleyn v. Barthe</i>, [1922] 1 A.C. 215.&nbsp; Similarly, commodity taxes which had previously been imposed on the manufacturer or seller, and so traditionally viewed as indirect, could be reframed as taxes on a purchaser to fall within Mill's test, and this too was accepted by the Privy Council; see <i>Atlantic Smoke Shops, Ltd. v. Conlon</i>, [1943] A.C. 550.</span></p>

Attorney-General for Canada</i>, [1930] A.C. 124, at p. 136, is a </span>“<span style="font-family:Shruti">living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits</span>”<span style="font-family:Shruti">.&nbsp; This well-known metaphor illustrates the principle recognized by this Court on many occasions that the interpretation of constitutional instruments, such as the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/30---31-vict-c-3-en" target="_blank">Constitution Act, 1867<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> or the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, can and should be adapted to changes in Canadian society; see, <i>inter alia</i>, Estey J.</span>’<span style="font-family:Shruti">s comments in <i>Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker</i>, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, at pp. 365-66, and <i>Attorney General of British Columbia v. Canada Trust Co.</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 466, in the context of taxation powers.&nbsp; Professor Hogg, <i>supra</i>, has observed that this principle has permitted progressive constitutional development in the face of immense changes, without constitutional amendment.&nbsp; As he put it, at pp. 413-14:</span></p>
