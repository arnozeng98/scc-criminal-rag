   <p class="Keywords"><span lang="EN-CA">Criminal law—Evidence—Hearsay—Statement by deceased made to counsel of the accused—Requirements for admission of the statement—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.&nbsp;C‑34, s.&nbsp;610.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The respondent O’Brien and one Jensen were jointly charged with possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. O’Brien was arrested and convicted; Jensen fled the country. Following the respondent’s conviction, Jensen returned to </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA"> but charges against him were stayed. Later on, Jensen told the respondent’s counsel, Mr.&nbsp;Simons, that he alone had committed the act. He agreed to testify to that effect but died before the hearing. The British Columbia Court of Appeal having granted leave to adduce fresh evidence, Mr.&nbsp;Simons repeated Jensen’s statement before that Court. On the strength of Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ testimony the Court allowed the appeal and directed an acquittal. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the question whether Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ evidence was inadmissible as hearsay.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">:<i> </i>The appeal should be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">It is settled law that evidence of a statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement. The evidence being offered by Mr.&nbsp;Simons to prove that Jensen and not O’Brien had committed the act, is a classic example of hearsay and is inadmissible unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">The respondent sought to support the admissibility of Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ testimony as falling within an exception to the hearsay rule. This Court considered that the rule established in <i>The Sussex Peerage </i>case, (1844), 8 E.R. 1034, as to absolute exclusion of declarations against penal interest should not be followed. However, a declaration against penal interest should meet certain</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 592]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">requirements before being held admissible. These requirements are, <i>inter alia</i>:<i> </i>(1) the fact stated should have been “to the deceased’s immediate prejudice” at the time when he stated it; (2) when the deceased made the statement he should have known the fact to be against his interest; (3) the declaration would have to be made to such a person and in such circumstances that the declarant should have apprehended a vulnerability to penal consequences as a result; (4) the vulnerability to penal consequences would have to be not remote. Jensen did not make his declaration of guilt until ten months after the respondent had been convicted and not until almost six months after the charges which he himself faced had been stayed. He made his statement in the privacy of Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ office and refused to swear an affidavit. His obvious desire was not to create damaging evidence, detrimental to his penal interest. Viewed from Jensen’s subjectivity, the statement was not against his interest. Failure to fall within the exception is fatal to the admission of Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ hearsay. The evidence being inadmissible, s.&nbsp;610 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>does not apply.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of the Court was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">DICKSON J.—Martin Edward O’Brien and Paul Jensen were jointly charged with possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. O’Brien was arrested and convicted; Jensen fled the country. Following O’Brien’s conviction, Jensen returned to </span><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span><span lang="EN-CA">. He told O’Brien’s counsel, Mr.&nbsp;Simons, that he, Jensen, alone had committed the act. He agreed to testify to that effect. Before the hearing, Jensen died. Leave to adduce fresh evidence was obtained from the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Mr.&nbsp;Simons repeated Jensen’s statement before that Court. On the strength of Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ testimony the Court allowed the appeal and directed an acquittal. The substantial question upon which this Crown appeal turns is whether Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ evidence was inadmissible as hearsay.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Leave to appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal was granted on the following question of law:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">That the Court of Appeal for </span><span lang="EN-CA">British Columbia</span><span lang="EN-CA"> erred at law in holding that hearsay evidence given before that Court by Sidney B. Simons pursuant to leave granted in accordance with section&nbsp;610 of the Criminal Code would have been capable of raising a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trial judge as to the guilt of the accused.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Mr.&nbsp;Justice McFarlane, of the British Columbia Court, was of opinion that the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Simons was not hearsay.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is settled law that evidence of a statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement; it is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement but the fact that it was made. This succinct formulation of the hearsay rule which one</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 594]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">finds in <i>Subramaniam v. Public Prosecutor</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[1]</span></span></span></a>, at p.&nbsp;970, was repeated with approval in <i>Ratten v. Reginam</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>at p.&nbsp;805. The reasons supporting the exclusion of hearsay evidence were stated by Lord Normand in <i>Teper v.</i> <i>The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[3]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>at p.&nbsp;486:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The rule against the admission of hearsay evidence is fundamental. It is not the best evidence and it is not delivered on oath. The truthfulness and accuracy of the person whose words are spoken to by another witness cannot be tested by cross-examination, and the light which his demeanour would throw on his testimony is lost.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Simons was offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted. It was sought, through that evidence, to prove that Jensen, and not O’Brien, had committed the act with which O’Brien stood charged, or at least to raise a reasonable doubt as to O’Brien’s guilt. That is the classic touchstone of inadmissible hearsay.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Before this Court counsel for O’Brien sought to support the admissibility of Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ testimony as falling within an exception to the hearsay rule. It was contended that a hearsay statement by a deceased person against his interest constitutes such an exception. The exception rests upon necessity and presumed trustworthiness. The witness is dead; there is no other evidence available on the point. It is considered that declarations made by persons against their own interests are “extremely unlikely to be false” <i>per </i>Fletcher Moulton L.J. in <i>Tucker v. Oldbury Urban Council</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[4]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>at p.&nbsp;321.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In several of the early cases the exception is expressed in broad language. Thus in <i>Standen v. Standen</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[5]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>in which the validity of a marriage was at issue Lord Kenyon heard the evidence of Charles Standen that the banns had not been duly published three times. Standen testified that he</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 595]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">had been told by the clergyman that a friend of the wife forbade them the second time they were published. As to this, Lord Kenyon said, at p.&nbsp;48:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">If the entry in the register was not truly stated, the clergyman was guilty of felony, and he put himself in a dangerous situation by making such a confession as that stated by the witness <i>Charles Standen.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>Middleton v. Malton</i><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[6]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>secondary evidence of the contents of a private book was received. Bayley J. said, at p.&nbsp;323:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It is a general principle of evidence, that declarations or statements of deceased persons are admissible when they appear to have been made against their interest.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">and Parke J. said, at p.&nbsp;327:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The general rule undoubtedly is, that facts must be proved by testimony upon oath. This case, however, falls within the exception necessarily engrafted upon that rule, viz. that an admission of a fact made by a deceased person, which is against the interest of the party making it at the time, is evidence of that fact as between third persons.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In <i>Powell v. Harper</i><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[7]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>Parke J. allowed a witness to testify as to what he had been told by one Askins who, it was said, had stolen a number of rosewood chair tops. Mr.&nbsp;Justice Parke dealt with an objection to the admission of this evidence by saying: “Yes. What he said is evidence to shew that he committed the larceny.”</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The question whether declarations against interest extended to declarations against penal interest as well as declarations against pecuniary interest was considered in <i>The Sussex Peerage</i><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[8]</span></span></span></a>.<i> </i>In that case, which the Crown asks the Court to follow, it was held by all of the Lords that the declarations of deceased persons are not generally admissible unless they are against the pecuniary interest of the party making them. Lord Campbell said, at p.&nbsp;1045:</span></p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 596]</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">But as to the point of interest, I have always understood the rule to be, that the declaration, to be admissible, must have been one which was contrary to the interests of the party making it, in a pecuniary point of view; and, with the exception of <i>Standen v. Standen, </i>I do not know any case which appears to break in upon that principle. I think it would lead to most inconvenient consequences, both to individuals and to the public, if we were to say that the apprehension of a criminal prosecution was an interest which ought to let in such declarations in evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Reasons in support of the more limited rule were advanced by Lord Brougham in the same case in the following strong language, at p.&nbsp;1045:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">To say, if a man should confess a felony for which he would be liable to prosecution, that therefore, the instant the grave closes over him all that was said by him is to be taken as evidence in every action and prosecution against another person, is one of the most monstrous and untenable propositions that can be advanced.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">and by Lord Denman in these words:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">With regard to declarations made by persons <i>in extremis, </i>supposing all necessary matters concurred, such as actual danger, death following it, and a full apprehension, at the time, of the danger and of death, such declarations can be received in evidence, but all these things must concur to render such declarations admissible. Such evidence, however, ought to be received with caution, because it is subject to no cross‑examination.</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">It has long been held that the interest to which the statement must be adverse must be a pecuniary one or, which is only a species of the same genus, a proprietary one. A statement would not be against interest if only generally criminatory; one “which might in some way or other injuriously affect the interest of the party” (per Lord Lyndhurst L.C., Lords Brougham and Denman in</span></p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 597]</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">the <i>Sussex Peerage Case</i>)<i> </i>or which might be prejudicial to reputation or social consideration.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">The reasons given for admitting such evidence at all shew the stringency of these essential conditions. The case is exceptional, not to say anomalous. The evidence thus admitted is hearsay and the person on whose credit it rests is beyond cross-examination and is not even seen by the jury. The ground is that it is very unlikely that a man would say falsely something as to which he knows the truth, if his statement tends to his own pecuniary disadvantage. As a reason this seems sordid and unconvincing. Men lie for so many reasons and some for no reason at all; and some tell the truth without thinking or even in spite of thinking about their pockets, but it is too late to question this piece of eighteenth century philosophy.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA">The Sussex Peerage </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">case has found some support in the American courts. In <i>Donnelly v.

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Dean Wigmore has made a devastating onslaught on a rule which would admit declarations against pecuniary interest but deny admission to declarations against penal interest (5 Wigmore (3d) paras.&nbsp;1476, 1477). His attack is founded upon logic and upon the historical argument that <i>The Sussex Peerage </i>case was a departure from the earlier rule that admissions against interest generally were accepted in a proper case; <i>The Sussex Peerage </i>case was a “backward step,” in the words of Traynor J. in <i>People v. Spriggs, supra. </i>Dean Wigmore is not alone in his reproach: see Baker, <i>The Hearsay Rule, </i>64; Morgan “Declarations Against Interest”, 5 Vand. L. Rev. 451; Jefferson, “Declarations Against Interest; an Exception to the Hearsay Rule”, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 1.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 599]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The effect of the rule in <i>The Sussex Peerage </i>case, as it has been generally understood, is to render admissible a statement by a deceased that he had received payment of a debt from another or that he held a parcel of land as tenant and not as owner, but to render inadmissible a confession by a deceased that he and not someone else was the real perpetrator of the crime. The distinction is arbitrary and tenuous. There is little or no reason why declarations against penal interest and those against pecuniary or proprietary interest should not stand on the same footing. A person is as likely to speak the truth in a matter affecting his liberty as in a matter affecting his pocketbook. For these reasons and the ever-present possibility that a rule of absolute prohibition could lead to grave injustice I would hold that, in a proper case, a declaration against penal interest is admissible according to the law of Canada; the rule as to absolute exclusion of declarations against penal interest, established in <i>The Sussex Peerage </i>case, should not be followed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There is a further question. Can it be said that Jensen’s declaration to Mr.&nbsp;Simons qualifies as a declaration against penal interest? The requirements to be met before admission of an extra judicial statement were stated by Hamilton L.J. in <i>Ward v. H.S. Pitt &amp; Co.; Lloyd v. Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company, supra. </i>In <i>Demeter v. The Queen</i><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[21]</span></span></span></a>,<i> </i>this Court held that the principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case furnished a valuable guide for consideration in the event this Court should determine that a declaration against penal interest was not to be held inadmissible under the rule against the reception of hearsay evidence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The second and third requirements in <i>Ward’s </i>case were:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">2. It is essential that such fact should have been “to the deceased’s immediate prejudice,” that is against his interest at the time when he stated it. If it may be construed for his interest or against it (<i>Massey v. Allen</i>) or may only be against his interest in certain future events (<i>ex parte Edwards</i>) it is inadmissible.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 600]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">3. It is essential that the deceased should have known the fact to be against his interest when he made it, because it is on the guarantee of truth based on a man’s conscious statement of a fact, “even though it be to his own hindrance,” that the whole theory of admissibility depends. It is “a necessary element, that the subject-matter of the declaration…must have been within the direct personal knowledge of the person making the declaration” (per Lord Selborne L.C. in <i>Sturla v. Freccia</i>);<i> </i>“to support the admissibility it must be shewn that the statement was, to the knowledge of the deceased, contrary to his interest” (per Fletcher Moulton in <i>Tucker v. Oldbury Urban Council, </i>[1912] 2 K.B.&nbsp;317,321).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The first and second principles enunciated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Demeter </i>were, in part:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">1. The declaration would have to be made to such a person and in such circumstances that the declarant should have apprehended a vulnerability to penal consequences as a result.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">2. The vulnerability to penal consequences would have to be not remote.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the case at bar, Jensen did not make his declaration of guilt until ten months after the respondent had been convicted and sentenced and not until almost six months after the charges which he himself faced had been stayed.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">As Professor Morgan has stressed in his article, in <i>The Sussex Peerage </i>case one of Lord Lyndhurst’s reasons for holding the testimony inadmissible was that the offered declarations were made to declarant’s own son, “and in so making them, it cannot be presumed that he would have exposed himself to prosecution, or that he made them under any belief that he should do so.”</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The guarantee of trustworthiness of a statement made out of Court flows from the fact that the statement is to the “deceased’s immediate prejudice.” To be admissible there must be a realization</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">by the declarant that the statement may well be used against him. That is the very thing Jensen wished to avoid. He had no intention of furnishing evidence against himself. His obvious desire was not to create damaging evidence, detrimental to his penal interest. Yet, that is the very basis upon which admissibility of extra-judicial declarations of penal interest rests. In my opinion, the statements of Jensen to Mr.&nbsp;Simons failed to meet the requirements for admissibility. Viewed from Jensen’s subjectivity, the statements were not against interest. Failure to fall within the exception is, therefore, fatal to the admissibility of Mr.&nbsp;Simons’ hearsay.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 610 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>lends no assistance to respondent’s case. It is a prerequisite that any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion granted by that section&nbsp;be admissible evidence. The section&nbsp;manifestly does not authorize a Court of Appeal to dispense with the law of hearsay evidence. If that were so we would have the anomalous situation in which counsel could seek to adduce on appeal that which the common law prohibits at trial. The section&nbsp;is not operative until the threshold for admissibility as defined by common law and statute is crossed. That threshold has not been crossed in the instant case.</span></p>
