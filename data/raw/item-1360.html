(an occasion which the respondent submits he does not recollect), the respondent allegedly invited his friends to the family residence, and permitted his friends to have intercourse with his young daughter in exchange for money.&nbsp; According to J.P.M.'s account of the event, when she resisted, the respondent helped physically restrain his daughter to facilitate the transaction.</span></p>

(4th) 1 (B.C.C.A.), Wood J.A. further argued that the incremental deterrent effect of an increased sentence drops off sharply past the 20-year mark.&nbsp; Wood J.A. also argued that the incremental returns to societal denunciation follow a similar path of diminishing returns.&nbsp; As he stated: "it does not seem realistic to assume that the measure of society's denunciation of this appellant's crimes would be lessened in any way by imposing a sentence of twenty years" (p. 116).&nbsp;&nbsp; On that point, he noted that denunciation ought to be distinguished from its "illegitimate retributive cousin", as "retribution is not a legitimate goal of sentencing", citing <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Hinch</i> <i>and</i> <i>Salanski</i>, [1968] 3 C.C.C. 39 (B.C.C.A.).</span></p>

XXIV] which are not part of the usual sentencing process" (p. 125).&nbsp; Finally, she held that the facts of this case did not amount to sufficient "special circumstances" warranting a sentence beyond 20 years, hence distinguishing this case from <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>E.D.</i> (1992), 16 B.C.A.C. 193.</span></p>

A. Thomas describes the principle in <i>Principles of Sentencing</i> (2nd ed. 1979), at p. 56:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is "just and appropriate".</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Clayton Ruby articulates the principle in the following terms in his treatise, <i>Sentencing</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 44-45:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The purpose is to ensure that a series of sentences, each properly imposed in relation to the offence to which it relates, is in aggregate "just and appropriate".&nbsp; A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of a sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender "a crushing sentence" not in keeping with his record and prospects. </span></p>

E. Rice, "Fixed-Term Sentences of More Than 20 Years Versus Life Imprisonment" (1994), 36 <i>Crim.

(as he then was) in <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Bell</i>, B.C.C.A., Vancouver Registry CA771150, September 27, 1978.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lambert J.A. responded to the Crown's request for a sentence beyond 20 years as follows:</span></p>

That this seems to be the conclusion, namely, that the appropriate sentence for the worst offence committed by the worst offender is life imprisonment and the next step down the scale is a sentence of 20 years imprisonment, is borne out by the reasons of Mr. Justice McIntyre in <i>R. v.

(G.W.)</i>.&nbsp; Twaddle J.A., speaking for the court, agreed that fixed-term sentences ought to be generally limited to 20 years, with the next sentencing step being life imprisonment.&nbsp; In so holding, Twaddle J.A. attached similar importance to the operation of the parole eligibility provisions, at p. 107:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">But in contrast to the previous cases, instead of reducing the offender's sentence from 22 years to 20 years, Twaddle J.A. concluded that in light of the gravity of the offender's crimes, his sentence ought to be <u>increased</u> to life.&nbsp; See also <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Nienhuis</i> (1991), 117 A.R. 253 (C.A.), and <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Dipietro</i> (1991), 120 A.R. 102 (C.A.), where the Alberta Court of Appeal increased an offender's sentence from 23½ years and 22 years respectively to life imprisonment, although in neither case did the court base its ruling on the operation of the parole eligibility provisions.</span></p>

(G.W.)</i>, the court has found special circumstances warranting the imposition of a sentence beyond 20 years.&nbsp; In <i>E.D.</i>, <i>supra</i>, the court sustained a cumulative sentence of 23 years for numerous offences against women and children.&nbsp; Speaking for the court, Hinds J.A. endorsed the case law of <i>Rooke</i> and <i>D. (G.W.)</i>, but noted, at p. 204, that "there are cases where in special circumstances sentences totalling more than 20 years have been approved or given by this Court".&nbsp; In light of the "extremely serious circumstances of the offences" and "the danger of [the offender] repeating his transgressions against women and children", he concluded that special circumstances were present justifying a lengthy sentence beyond the qualified legal ceiling.&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Caissie</i> (1993), 24 B.C.A.C. 57, the court upheld a cumulative sentence of 22 years for sexual assault and robbery.&nbsp; Although life imprisonment was available for the robbery conviction, Hinds J.A. declined to impose the maximum penalty since the offender did not represent a "worst offender".&nbsp; Nonetheless, Hinds J.A. held that the offender's propensity for violence and his dim prospects for rehabilitation justified a cumulative sentence beyond 20 years.&nbsp; As he held, at p. 65: "In the special circumstances of this case the totality principle of sentencing is not offended."</span></p>

P. Cole and A. Manson, <i>Release from Imprisonment</i> (1990), at pp. 159-63.&nbsp; The earliest legislative scheme resembling parole appears to date from the <i>Penitentiary Act</i> <i>of 1868</i>, S.C. 1868, c. 75, which provided for a simple mechanism for sentence remission.&nbsp; However, the first contemporary regime for conditional release was established at the end of the 19th century with the "Ticket of Leave Act", <i>An Act to provide for the Conditional Liberation of Penitentiary Convicts</i>, S.C. 1899, c. 49.&nbsp; Under that statute, a convict could apply to executive authorities for early release, subject to a variety of conditions of supervision, prior to the expiration of his sentence.&nbsp; See Cole and Manson, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 164-67.&nbsp; As M. E. Campbell and D. P. Cole point out, "Conditional Release Considerations in Sentencing" (1985), 42 C.R. (3d) 191, at p. 203, n. 14, the "Ticket of Leave Act" was generally viewed as a mechanism which codified and regularized the exercise of the Crown's prerogative of clemency.&nbsp; Accordingly, applications under the Act were understood as a mechanism for the <u>reduction of sentence</u>.</span></p>

(3d) 57, at p. 61, in discussing the 10-year parole ineligibility for second-degree murder under s. 744 of the <i>Code</i>: "Parliament's purpose in adding a minimum period of parole ineligibility to a life sentence was, in my view, twofold.&nbsp; It was to deter and denounce the crime."</span></p>

Ct. J. to 18 years and 8 months.&nbsp; In my reading of the judgment of the Court of Appeal below, I find little evidence that the passing remarks of Wood J.A. in relation to the legitimacy of retribution played a significant role in his conclusion that the respondent's sentence ought to be reduced to 18 years and 8 months' imprisonment.&nbsp; It should be noted that Rowles J.A., in her concurring reasons, did not even discuss retribution as a principle of sentencing.&nbsp; Similarly, there is no evidence that Filmer Prov. Ct. J. placed any explicit reliance on the objective of "retribution" in initially rendering his stern sentence.&nbsp; Accordingly, whether or not Wood J.A. erred as a strict matter of law in his discussion of the philosophical merits of retribution as a principle of sentencing, I conclude that Wood J.A.'s discussion of retribution was not a decisive element in the majority of the Court of Appeal's conclusion that the sentence of the respondent ought to be reduced to below 19 years.&nbsp; Therefore, I am persuaded that the remarks of Wood J.A. in relation to retribution did not constitute a reversible error.&nbsp; However, given the continued judicial debate over this issue, particularly in recent judgments of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (see, e.g., <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Hicks</i> (1995), 56 B.C.A.C. 259, at para. 14 (rejecting retribution),&nbsp; <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Eneas</i>, [1994] B.C.J.

Hinch and Salanski</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 43-44; <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Calder</i> (1956), 114 C.C.C. 155 (Man. C.A.), at p. 161.&nbsp; But it should be clear from my foregoing discussion that retribution bears little relation to vengeance, and I attribute much of the criticism of retribution as a principle to this confusion.&nbsp; As both academic and judicial commentators have noted, vengeance has no role to play in a civilized system of sentencing.&nbsp; See Ruby, <i>Sentencing</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 13.&nbsp; Vengeance, as I understand it, represents an uncalibrated act of harm upon another, frequently motivated by emotion and anger, as a reprisal for harm inflicted upon oneself by that person.&nbsp; Retribution in a criminal context, by contrast, represents an objective, reasoned and measured determination of an appropriate punishment which properly reflects the <u>moral culpability</u> of the offender, having regard to the intentional risk-taking of the offender, the consequential harm caused by the offender, and the normative character of the offender's conduct.&nbsp; Furthermore, unlike vengeance, retribution incorporates a principle of restraint; retribution requires the imposition of a just and appropriate punishment, and <u>nothing more</u>.&nbsp; As R. Cross has noted in <i>The English Sentencing System</i> (2nd ed. 1975), at p. 121: "The retributivist insists that the punishment must not be disproportionate to the offender's deserts."</span></p>

App. R. 74, at p. 77: "society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which the courts can show this is by the sentences they pass".&nbsp; The relevance of both retribution and denunciation as goals of sentencing underscores that our criminal justice system is not simply a vast system of negative penalties designed to prevent objectively harmful conduct by increasing the cost the offender must bear in committing an enumerated offence.&nbsp; Our criminal law is also a system of values.&nbsp; A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated.&nbsp; In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

And as La Forest J. emphasized in <i>Lyons</i>, the relative weight and importance of these multiple factors will frequently vary depending on the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender.&nbsp; In the final analysis, the overarching duty of a sentencing judge is to draw upon all the legitimate principles of sentencing to determine a "just and appropriate" sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.</span></p>

(2d) 145 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1977] 1 S.C.R. 827, had suggested that a trial judge should exercise his or her discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment (if available) when faced with a patently dangerous offender who enjoys no prospects for rehabilitation.&nbsp; As Jessup J.A. expressed the sentencing principle in <i>Hill</i>, at p. 147:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Pursuant to this principle, the Court of Appeal increased a sentence of 12 years for an aggravated rape to one of life imprisonment.&nbsp; See, similarly, <i>R. v.

Ct. J. relied principally or even substantially on the dangerousness of the offender in justifying his imposition of a 25-year term of imprisonment.&nbsp; Accordingly, for the purposes of this appeal, it is unnecessary to address the question of whether there are circumstances where a stringent <u>fixed-term</u> sentence (as opposed to a <u>life</u> sentence) motivated almost exclusively by the acute dangerousness of the offender may inappropriately circumvent the substantive and procedural protections of Part XXIV of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; That question is best left for another day.</span></p>

R. 40 (C.A.), at p. 43; <i>&nbsp;R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Wood</i> (1979), 21 Crim. L.Q. 423 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 424; <i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Mellstrom</i> (1975), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 472 (Alta.

C.A.), at p. 187.&nbsp; But in exercising this role, courts of appeal must still exercise a margin of deference before intervening in the specialized discretion that Parliament has explicitly vested in sentencing judges.&nbsp; It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime.&nbsp; See <i>Mellstrom, Morrissette</i> and <i>Baldhead.</i>&nbsp; Sentencing is an inherently individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of academic abstraction.&nbsp; As well, sentences for a particular offence should be expected to vary to some degree across various communities and regions in this country, as the "just and appropriate" mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurred.&nbsp; For these reasons, consistent with the general standard of review we articulated in <i>Shropshire</i>, I believe that a court of appeal should only intervene to minimize the disparity of sentences where the sentence imposed by the trial judge is in substantial and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing similar crimes.</span></p>

S-26<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.&nbsp; We have previously acknowledged that this discretionary power extends to making an order for costs in a criminal case, including both summary conviction matters (<i>R.</i> <i>v</i>. <i>Trask</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 304 (costs denied)) and indictable matters (<i>Olan v. The Queen</i>, No. 14000, October 11, 1977 (costs allowed)).&nbsp; But the prevailing convention of criminal practice is that whether the criminal defendant is successful or unsuccessful on the merits of the case, he or she is generally not entitled to costs.&nbsp; See <i>Berry</i> <i>v</i>. <i>British Transport Commission</i>, [1962] 1 Q.B. 306 (C.A.), at p. 326, <i>per</i> Devlin L.C.J.&nbsp; The <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> codifies this convention as a matter of appellate practice before provincial courts of appeal in cases involving indictable offences.&nbsp; See s. 683(3) of the <i>Code</i>, but see. s. 839(3) regarding summary conviction cases.&nbsp; Consistent with this established convention, in <i>Trask</i>, we denied costs under s. 47 to a criminal defendant following a <u>successful</u> appeal of a summary conviction matter, as there was nothing "remarkable" about the defendant's case, nor was there any "oppressive or improper conduct" alleged against the Crown (at pp. 307-8).</span></p>
