 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

24.4pt">The integrity of the criminal process and the role of appeal courts could be jeopardized by the routine admission of fresh evidence on appeal, since this would create a two‑tier sentencing system.&nbsp; That kind of system would be incompatible with the high standard of review applicable to appeals from sentences and the underlying “profound functional justifications”:&nbsp;&nbsp;see <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i>, [1996]&nbsp;1&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;500, at para.&nbsp;91.&nbsp; Despite the fresh evidence, the sentencing judge, unlike the appeal judge, has the benefit of being able to directly assess the other evidence, the testimony and the submissions of the parties, as well as being familiar with the needs and current conditions of and in the community where the crime was committed:&nbsp;&nbsp;see <i>M. (C.A.)</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para.&nbsp;91.&nbsp; Furthermore, appeal courts are not the appropriate forum in which to determine questions of fact, and they should do so only when the fresh evidence presents certain characteristics such as would justify expanding their traditional role.&nbsp; This Court has already identified those characteristics, in <i>Palmer.</i>&nbsp; In my view, whether the appeal relates to a verdict or a sentence, the criteria laid down by this Court in <i>Palmer</i> are the criteria that are to be applied where a court of appeal is determining whether to admit fresh evidence.

Warsing</i>, [1998]&nbsp;3&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;579, at para.&nbsp;51).&nbsp; The fact remains that this criterion is an important one whose specific purpose is to protect the interests and the administration of justice and to preserve the role of the appellate court (<i>Lévesque</i>, at para.&nbsp;30, citing <i>R. v.

The Queen</i>, [1979]&nbsp;2&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;749, McIntyre&nbsp;J. stated that evidence of facts tending to prove a potential but untried offence was admissible in the circumstances, because the appellant had tendered evidence of good character and because this evidence, called in reply, related to the issue of “the [accused’s] character, conduct, and attitude, all proper factors to be taken into consideration on sentencing” (p.&nbsp;754).&nbsp; The Court therefore held that the trial judge had not erred in admitting a police officer’s testimony that, barely a year after the offence in that case, the accused had had a weapon and a mask in his apartment and had admitted that he was considering a further crime.&nbsp; Based on that evidence, the trial judge had said he was “[not] convinced that this man has learned his lesson” (p.&nbsp;753).&nbsp; McIntyre&nbsp;J. laid emphasis on these reasons of the trial judge in order to distinguish that case from others in which it was clear that the courts had imposed more severe sentences on the basis of uncharged or unproved offences that predated the trial (p.&nbsp;754).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
30.05pt;line-height:12.2pt">One of the hardest tasks confronting a trial judge is sentencing.&nbsp; The stakes are high for society and for the individual.&nbsp; Sentencing is the critical stage of the criminal justice system, and it is manifest that the judge should not be denied an opportunity to obtain relevant information by the imposition of all the restrictive evidential rules common to a trial.&nbsp; Yet the obtaining and weighing of such evidence should be fair.&nbsp; A substantial liberty interest of the offender is involved and the information obtained should be accurate and reliable.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
30.05pt;line-height:24.4pt">It is a commonplace that the strict rules which govern at trial do not apply at a sentencing hearing and it would be undesirable to have the formalities and technicalities characteristic of the normal adversary proceeding prevail.&nbsp; The hearsay rule does not govern the sentencing hearing.&nbsp; Hearsay evidence may be accepted where found to be credible and trustworthy.&nbsp; The judge traditionally has had wide latitude as to the sources and types of evidence upon which to base his sentence.&nbsp; He must have the fullest possible information concerning the background of the accused if he is to fit the sentence to the offender rather than to the crime.&nbsp; [p.&nbsp;414]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">[T]he “double‑track” system has been elaborated in ways which may seem to us somewhat metaphysical: punishment which is to be “guilt‑adequate”, i.e. orientated towards the criminal act, is carefully distinguished from mere “measures” orientated to the criminal’s character and the needs of society. The recent German Penal Code preserves this distinction though it is regretted as artificial by many. Certainly the prisoner who after serving a three‑year sentence is told that his punishment is over but that a seven‑year period of preventive detention awaits him and that this is a “measure” of social protection, not a punishment, might think he was being tormented by a barren piece of conceptualism — though he might not express himself in that way.</p>
