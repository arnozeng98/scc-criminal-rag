He was sixteen when the incident occurred and testified that he had reacted to the victim's uninvited homosexual advances. He relied on the defences of provocation and selfâdefence. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial because the trial judge failed to charge the jury that the objective "ordinary person" standard for the defence of provocation had to take account of the age and sex of the accused. The central question here was how the objective test for the provocation defence was to be formulated and the extent to which characteristics peculiar to the individual accused could be taken into account.</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Estey, Chouinard and La&nbsp;Forest JJ.: The trial judge's charge to the jury as to the ordinary person standard in the defence of provocation was consistent with the requirements of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and was correct in law. It was not necessary to direct the jury that the ordinary person means an ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ordinary or reasonable person has a normal temperament and level of selfâcontrol and is not exceptionally excitable, pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness. In terms of other characteristics of the ordinary person, the "collective good sense" of the jury will lead it to ascribe to the ordinary person any general characteristics relevant to the provocation in question. Since features such as sex, age, or race, do not detract from a person's characterization as ordinary, particular characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an ordinary person without subverting the logic of the objective test. It would be impossible to conceptualize a sexless or ageless ordinary person. The central criterion, however, is the relevance of the particular feature to the provocation in question. </span></p>

In applying their common sense to the factual determination of the objective test, jury members will quite naturally and properly ascribe certain characteristics to the "ordinary person".</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second test of provocation involves an assessment of what actually occurred in the mind of the accused. The trial judge must make clear to the jury that its task at this point is to ascertain whether the accused was <u>in fact</u> acting as a result of provocation. In this regard, a trial judge may wish to remind jury members that they are entitled to take into account the accused's mental state and psychological temperament.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge did not err in failing to specify that the ordinary person, for the purposes of the objective test of provocation, is deemed to be of the same sex and age as the accused. It is neither wise nor necessary to make this a mandatory component of all jury charges on provocation. The judge's charge on the subjective prong of the provocation defence would not have misled the average juror with respect to the objective test when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole.</span></p>

This standard means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of selfâcontrol as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in today's society. If the allegedly provocative conduct will not cause this ordinary person to lose "the power of selfâcontrol", there can be no application of the defence. Where the threshold is passed, however, the act meets the test for provocation and consideration may be given to the defence. If the accused lost selfâcontrol through that provocation and if he acted on the sudden before his passion cooled, the defence applies. The jury applies the subjective test in making this last determination and considers the individual characteristics of the accused which could affect his reaction to the insult or wrongful act.</span></p>

It was not mandatory that the judge instruct the jury that the ordinary person is deemed to be of the same age and sex as the accused for the objective test of provocation. In some cases, however, failure to do so would be unfair and constitute reversible error, not because of a special rule applicable to charges on provocation, but because of the general rule that the judge's charge be fair.</span></p>

To do so would undermine the basic principles of equality and individual responsibility. However, the accused's physical characteristics and the circumstances in which he is found can be considered in applying the objective "ordinary person" test if they are relevant in placing the wrongful act or insult in its proper context for the purpose of assessing its gravity. The jury must be directed to consider any facts which make the wrongful act or insult comprehensible to them in the same way that it was comprehended by the accused and then, having appreciated the factual context in which that wrongful act or insult took place, measure the accused's response to this insult against the objective standard of the ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted.</span></p>

The accused's age was relevant to the standard of selfâcontrol of the ordinary person rather than to the gravity of the provocation: <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin</i>, [1978] A.C. 705. The trial judge's charge to the jury was calculated to lead the jury to conclude that they should not consider the age of the accused with reference to whether there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of selfâcontrol, but only with reference to whether the accused acted upon the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool. For this reason the appeal should be dismissed. As to whether the trial judge was required to say anything concerning the age and sex of the accused: the sex of the accused and its relevance to the nature and gravity of the provocation were obvious and did not require any observation from the trial judge; the relative youth of the accused would also presumably be obvious but its relevance as a matter of law to the question whether there had been wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of selfâcontrol might be less obvious to a jury and should probably have been drawn to their attention. </span></p>

The position of the Crown at trial was that Hill and Pegg were homosexual lovers and that Hill had decided to murder Pegg after a falling out between them. The Crown argued that Hill deliberately struck Pegg in the head while Pegg lay in bed. This did not kill Pegg who immediately ran from the bedroom into the bathroom to try and stop the flow of blood from his head. Realizing he had been unsuccessful, Hill took two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.</span></p>

Hill testified that he had known Pegg for about a year through the latter's involvement with the "Big Brothers" organization. Hill stated that on the night in question he had been the subject of unexpected and unwelcome homosexual advances by Pegg while asleep on the couch in Pegg's apartment. Pegg pursued Hill to the bathroom and grabbed him, at which time Hill picked up a nearby hatchet and swung it at Pegg in an attempt to scare him. The hatchet struck Pegg in the head. Hill then ran from the apartment but returned shortly afterward. Upon reâentering the apartment, he was confronted by Pegg who threatened to kill him. At this point, Hill obtained two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.</span></p>

The effect of the charge was that an ordinary person did not include a 16 year old or youth and may well have established as the standard an ordinary person more experienced and mature than the ordinary 16 year old or youth.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The defence of provocation appears to have first developed in the early 1800's. Tindal C.J. in <i>R. v. Hayward</i> (1833), 6 C. &amp; P. 157, at p. 158, told the jury that the defence of provocation was derived from the law's "compassion to human infirmity". It acknowledged that all human beings are subject to uncontrollable outbursts of passion and anger which may lead them to do violent acts. In such instances, the law would lessen the severity of criminal liability.</span></p>

By the middle of the nineteenth century, it became clear that the provoking act had to be sufficient to excite an ordinary or reasonable person under the circumstances. As Keating J. stated in <i>R. v. Welsh</i> (1869), 11 Cox C.C. 336, at p. 338:</span></p>

First, the provoking wrongful act or insult must be of such a nature that it would deprive an ordinary person of the power of selfâcontrol. That is the initial threshold which must be surmounted. Secondly, the accused must actually have been provoked. As I have earlier indicated, these two elements are often referred to as the objective and subjective tests of provocation respectively. Thirdly, the accused must have acted on the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his or her passion to cool.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In considering the precise meaning and application of the ordinary person standard or objective test, it is important to identify its underlying <i>rationale</i>. Lord Simon of Glaisdale has perhaps stated it most succinctly when he suggested in <i>Camplin</i>, at p. 726, that "the reason for importing into this branch of the law the concept of the reasonable man [was] ... to avoid the injustice of a man being entitled to rely on his exceptional excitability or pugnacity or illâtemper or on his drunkenness". </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there were no objective test to the defence of provocation, anomalous results could occur. A wellâtempered, reasonable person would not be entitled to benefit from the provocation defence and would be guilty of culpable homicide amounting to murder, while an illâtempered or exceptionally excitable person would find his or her culpability mitigated by provocation and would be guilty only of manslaughter. It is society's concern that reasonable and nonâviolent behaviour be encouraged that prompts the law to endorse the objective standard. The criminal law is concerned among other things with fixing standards for human behaviour. We seek to encourage conduct that complies with certain societal standards of reasonableness and responsibility. In doing this, the law quite logically employs the objective standard of the reasonable person.</span></p>

App. R. 7, the English Court of Criminal Appeal refused to take into account the mental deficiency of the accused in assessing the availability of the provocation defence. It confirmed the threshold objective test for provocation whereby there must be sufficient provocation to excite a reasonable person. A reasonable or ordinary person was not one with mental deficiencies. In <i>Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1942] A.C. 1, the House of Lords endorsed the <i>Lesbini</i> case and further elaborated the objective test of provocation. Viscount Simon stated, at p. 9:</span></p>

In <i>Bedder v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1119, a sexually impotent man killed a prostitute after she taunted him about his physical condition. The House of Lords had to determine whether, in applying the objective test of provocation, the sexual impotence of the accused should be taken into account. The test would then have been whether an ordinary person, who was sexually impotent, would have been provoked. The Court rejected this approach and held that the peculiar physical characteristics of the accused were not to be ascribed to the ordinary person for the purposes of the objective test.</span></p>

The court thereupon approved and reiterated the proposition that the question for the jury was whether on the facts ... from the evidence the provocation was in fact enough to lead a reasonable person to do what the accused did.</span></p>

In <i>Camplin</i>, the House of Lords expressly rejected the narrow objective test articulated in <i>Bedder</i>. The <i>Camplin</i> case involved a youth of fifteen years of age who maintained that he had been provoked by a homosexual assault. The House of Lords unanimously concluded that the ordinary person, for the purposes of the objective test of provocation, was to be an ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused. It should be noted that in <i>Camplin</i>, the trial judge had specifically directed the jury to take age and sex into account and the appeal sought to establish that this was wrong. In the present case, there was no such instruction. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One conceptual difficulty was acknowledged by Lord Diplock. He recognized that "in strict logic there is a transition between treating age as a characteristic that may be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the provocation addressed to the accused and treating it as a characteristic to be taken into account in determining what is the degree of selfâcontrol to be expected of the ordinary person" (p. 717). In most cases, it is appropriate to assume that the level of selfâcontrol or degree of reasonableness is the same regardless of certain physical differences. Age, however, in Lord Diplock's view posed a more difficult problem. He resolved this problem with respect to age by appealing to the acknowledged importance of the law's compassion to human infirmity. On a more general level, he rejected the solution of separating out the inquiry into two phases as overly complicated for the jury.</span></p>

Similarly,&nbsp;Cartwright J., as he then was (dissenting on another issue) wrote, at p. 415, that the trial judge correctly "made it plain that on this [objective] branch of the inquiry no account should be taken of the idiosyncracies of the appellant and that the standard was that of an ordinary person".</span></p>

The father was said to have been a bad tempered and violent man who had mistreated his son on a number of occasions. The accused had not seen his father for a period of about five years until a few days prior to the fatal incident. On the evening of the shooting, the accused had spent most of the day drinking with his friends. In considering the objective test of provocation, the Court rejected the relevance of the quality of the accused's relationship with his father, the mentality of the accused or his possible drunkenness. Fauteux J. quoted, at p. 340, the words of Lord Simonds L.C. in <i>Bedder</i>, that the purpose of the objective test is "to invite the jury to consider the act of the accused by reference to a certain standard or norm of conduct and with this object the âreasonableâ or the âaverageâ or the ânormalâ man is invoked".

The accused, born in India, was alleged to have been provoked by, <i>inter alia</i>, the deceased's statement "I am not going to marry you because you are a black man". The Court's ruling seems to narrow unduly the conception of the ordinary person and rigidly prohibit a consideration of the physical characteristics of the accused along the lines of the <i>Bedder</i> case. I should note that <i>ParÂ­nerkar</i> was affirmed by this Court on appeal: see [1974] S.C.R. 449; however, this particular question was not addressed.</span></p>

Hypothetically, the ordinary person is subjected to the same external pressures of insult by acts or words as was the accused. Only if those pressures would cause an ordinary person to lose selfâcontrol does the next question arise whether the accused did, in fact, lose selfâcontrol. In my view, the objective test lacks validity if the reaction of the hypothetical ordinary person is not tested against all of the events which put pressure on the accused.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of other characteristics of the ordinary person, it seems to me that the "collective good sense" of the jury will naturally lead it to ascribe to the ordinary person any general characteristics relevant to the provocation in question. For example, if the provocation is a racial slur, the jury will think of an ordinary person with the racial background that forms the substance of the insult. To this extent, particular characteristics will be ascribed to the ordinary person. Indeed, it would be impossible to conceptualize a sexless or ageless ordinary person. Features such as sex, age, or race, do not detract from a person's characterization as ordinary. Thus particular characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an ordinary person without subverting the logic of the objective test of provocation. As Lord Diplock wrote in <i>Camplin</i> at pp. 716â17:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to note that, in some instances, certain characteristics will be irrelevant. For example, the race of a person will be irrelevant if the provocation involves an insult regarding a physical disability. Similarly, the sex of an accused will be irrelevant if the provocation relates to a racial insult. Thus the central criterion is the relevance of the particular feature to the provocation in question. With this in mind, I think it is fair to conclude that age will be a relevant consideration when we are dealing with a young accused person. For a jury to assess what an ordinary person would have done if subjected to the same circumstances as the accused, the young age of an accused will be an important contextual consideration.</span></p>

Juries are perfectly capable of sizing the matter up. In my experience as a trial judge I cannot recall a single instance in which a jury returned to the courtroom to ask for further instructions on the provocation portion of a murder charge. A jury frequently seeks further guidance on the distinction between first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter, but rarely, if ever, on provocation. It seems to be common ground that the trial judge would not have been in error if he had simply read s. 215 of the <i>Code</i> and left it at that, without embellishment. I am loathe to complicate the task of the trial judge, in cases such as the case at bar, by requiring him or her as a matter of law to point out to the members of the jury that in applying the objective test they must conceptualize an "ordinary person" who is male and young. The accused is before them. He is male and young. I cannot conceive of a Canadian jury conjuring up the concept of an "ordinary person" who would be either female or elderly, or banishing from their minds the possibility that an "ordinary person" might be both young and male. I do not think anything said by the judge in the case at bar would have lead the jury to such an absurdity.</span></p>

Subsection (1) provides for the defence. Subsection (2) defines the nature of the act or insult which will be sufficient to amount to provocation. It does not deal with the nature or with any of the individual characteristics of the person seeking to rely on the defence. It establishes a standard to apply to all persons in determining what will amount to provocation, the standard of the ordinary person. The concept of the ordinary person or the reasonable man is wellâknown in the law. Many definitions have been formulated. A fitting one may be found in the words of Lord Diplock in the <i>Camplin</i> case [[1978] A.C. 705 (H.L.), at pp. 716â17], cited by the Chief Justice, in these terms:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">...the "reasonable man" has never been confined to the adult male. It means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of selfâcontrol as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today.</span></p>

However, where that threshold is passed, the act meets the test for provocation and consideration may be given to the defence. If it is found that the accused was deprived of the power of selfâcontrol by the provocation and that he acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool, the defence will apply. In making that last determination the jury may apply what has been called the subjective test, the individual characteristics of the accused which could affect his reaction to the wrongful act or insult, such as race, colour, religion, sex and drunkenness, and other subjective factors affecting his reaction may be considered. This proposition has the support of binding authority in this country: see <i>Taylor v. The King</i>, [1947] S.C.R. 462; <i>Salamon v. The Queen</i>, [1959] S.C.R. 404; and <i>Wright v.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason that the two tests, objective and subjective, are separated in this defence is clear. The law fixes a standard for all which must be met before reliance may be placed on the provocation defence. Everyone, whatever his or her idiosyncracies, is expected to observe that standard. It is not every insult or injury that will be sufficient to relieve a person from what would otherwise be murder. The "ordinary person" standard is adopted to fix the degree of selfâcontrol and restraint expected of all in society. The law, however, does recognize frailty when the threshold test is passed and a person is provided beyond the level of tolerance of the ordinary person. Then the individual characteristics of the accused may be considered and, where the other terms of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec215" target="_blank">s. 215<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> are met, the defence will apply.</span></p>

As regards age, I therefore agree that, when giving content to the ordinary person standard, as said by the Chief Justice, "age will be a relevant consideration when we are dealing with a young accused person", and that, "For a jury to assess what an ordinary person would have done if subjected to the same circumstances as the accused, the young age of an accused will be an important contextual consideration".</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also of his view that it is not mandatory that the judge instruct the jury "that the ordinary person, for the purposes of the objective test of provocation, is to be deemed to be of the same age and sex as the accused". But I should like to add that there will, in my view, be cases where failure to do so, given the particular circumstances of the case, would be unfair and constitute reversible error; but not because of a special rule applicable to charges on provocation, but rather under the general rule that the judge's charge to the jury must always be fair.</span></p>

However, it would appear that the respondent, a sixteenâyear old youth, was acquainted with the deceased, Verne Pegg, through Pegg's having acted as a volunteer "big brother" to the respondent and his younger brother. Pegg, who was thirtyâtwo years of age at the time of his death, had befriended the respondent and the two had engaged in numerous social activities together over a period of about a year.</span></p>

Next to the body were two bloodâstained steak knives which had apparently been used to inflict several laceration and puncture wounds on the chest of the deceased. On the floor in the bedroom the police discovered a hatchet covered with the deceased's blood. It would appear that this hatchet had been used to inflict a deep gash on the right side of the deceased's head. The walls and floor of the bedroom and living room were splattered with blood, as were also the sheets on the deceased's bed. </span></p>

A search of the vehicle turned up a number of credit cards and other identification in Pegg's name. The respondent denied knowing the deceased at first but eventually made a statement to the police indicating that he had killed Pegg in the early morning hours after Pegg had made uninvited sexual advances toward him.</span></p>

The respondent, however, testified in his own defence and presented a very different picture. He stated that he had visited Pegg's apartment the previous evening and had fallen asleep on Pegg's sofa. He was awakened at approximately 1:00 a.m. by Pegg's uninvited caressing of his chest and legs. It was the respondent's contention that he was so shocked and enraged at Pegg's actions that he unthinkingly grabbed a hatchet which was lying with some camping equipment and swung it at Pegg striking him on the head. As Pegg staggered away the respondent fled the apartment clad only in his underwear.</span></p>

On entering the apartment he saw Pegg standing with the telephone in his hand. Pegg said he was going to kill him. The respondent thereupon grabbed two knives from the kitchen counter and as the deceased slowly advanced towards him stabbed him twice in the chest. The respondent could not recall stabbing Pegg a third time, but he testified that between the first and second blows Pegg struggled upright and, half sitting, threatened his life again. After the stabbing the respondent took Pegg's keys and wallet from the bedroom, dressed himself and fled the scene in Pegg's car. He testified that he was in a state of shock while driving the car down the centre of Highway 401, haunted by the terrifying spectre of Pegg's face as he advanced towards him in the apartment. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel for the respondent challenged this formulation of the first part of the defence of provocation on the basis that it did not make clear to the jury that the "ordinary person" whose reaction they were to consider was an ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused. Brooke J.A., in brief oral reasons on behalf of a unanimous court, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. In his view, the failure of the trial judge to charge the jury that the objective "ordinary person" standard must take account of the age and sex of the accused was misdirection. As the matter was left to the jury by the trial judge, the respondent's age and sex could only be considered in the second stage of the provocation defence after it had already been determined that the ordinary person might have had a more mature and controlled reaction than the respondent. This was seriously prejudicial to the defence and the conviction could not be allowed to stand. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The central question posed in this appeal is how the objective test for the provocation defence is to be formulated and the extent to which characteristics peculiar to the individual accused can be taken into account. Section 215(2) of the <i>Code</i> provides merely that the incident giving rise to the provocation must be "of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of selfâcontrol...." This rather cryptic statutory language requires interpretation in order to achieve the presumed purpose of the legislature in requiring the accused's conduct to be measured against that of the "ordinary person". What is the rationale underlying the objective test?</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the "reasonable man" standard in tort law, the reference to the "ordinary person" in s. 215(2) embodies the notion that acts falling below the applicable standard are considered wrongful whether or not the individual defendant (or accused) had the capacity to meet the standard. Thus, in the classic negligence case of <i>Vaughan v. Menlove</i> (1837), 3 Bing. N.C. 468 (C.P.), it was held that a defendant's innate stupidity cannot be put forward as a tort defence since he owes his neighbour a duty to take reasonable care regardless of his personal capacity for reasonableness. Similarly in the context of criminal culpability, it was held in the leading case of <i>R. v. Lesbini</i> (1914), 11 Cr. App. R. 7 (C.A.), that the mental deficiency of the accused cannot be taken into account in analyzing the defence of provocation since, short of insanity, the law imposes full responsibility for intentional injurious acts except in those provocative situations where the ordinary person would not have acted any differently.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stupidity, of course, is not the only subjective character trait which cannot be taken into account in measuring the accused's acts against the objective standard of behaviour. Almost the entire spectrum of personality traits has been considered and rejected by English and Canadian courts as factors pertinent to the provocation defence. Thus, in <i>Salamon v. The Queen</i>, [1959] S.C.R. 404, it was determined that the temperament of the accused and his peculiar psychological makeâup are not relevant to the question whether he has met the objective standard required of every person. Similarly, the fact that the accused was unusually excitable or prone to emotional outburts was disallowed as a factor which the jury could consider in <i>Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1942] A.C. 1 (H.L.) And a tendency toward fits of rage brought on by drunkenness was excluded as an ingredient making up the standard of behavÂ­iour of the "ordinary person" in <i>Wright v. The Queen</i>, [1969] S.C.R. 335. As Laycraft J.A. has recently indicated in <i>R. v. Daniels</i> (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (N.W.T.C.A.), at p. 551, such varying mental and emotional capacities or personality traits, if attributed to the "ordinary person" and taken into account by the jury in the first stage of the analysis of the provocation defence, would "denude the test of objectivity". </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective standard, therefore, may be said to exist in order to ensure that in the evaluation of the provocation defence there is no fluctuating standard of selfâcontrol against which accuseds are measured. The governing principles are those of equality and individual responsibility, so that all persons are held to the same standard notwithstanding their distinctive personality traits and varying capacities to achieve the standard. The success of a provocation defence rests on establishing the accused's act as one which any ordinary person might have done in the circumstances and not upon eliciting the court's compassion for an accused whose act was unjustified but who could not control himself in the way expected of an ordinary person. It is evident that any deviation from this objective standard against which an accused's level of selfâcontrol is measured necessarily introduces an element of inequality in the way in which the actions of different persons are evaluated and must therefore be avoided if the underlying principle that all persons are equally responsible for their actions is to be maintained.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more difficult problem arises when the question is whether the physical attributes of the accused can be considered and incorporated into the objective standard. This has been a somewhat vexatious question on which the English and Canadian authorities are divided. In <i>Bedder v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1119 (H.L.), it was held that purely physical peculiarities of the accused could not be taken into account by the jury in applying the objective test to the accused's behaviour. The accused in that case was a sexually impotent man who was jeered at by a prostitute when he was unable to have sexual intercourse with her. The House of Lords reasoned that sexual impotency was not an ailment suffered by the "ordinary person" and that as such it could not be considered in any objective assessment of the accused's reaction to the victim's taunt. A similar line of reasoning was pursued by Culliton C.J.S. in <i>R. v. Parnerkar</i> (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 11 (Sask. C.A.), and affirmed by Fauteux C.J. in <i>Parnerkar v. The Queen</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 449. In that case the ethnic background of the accused was rejected as a factor that could be taken into account in the objective stage of the provocation defence. The accused was a black man who was subjected to a racial slur by a woman with whom he had a long standing relationship and whom he desired to marry. Culliton C.J.S. indicated (at p. 27) that although the derogatory use of the word "black" might have particular significance to the accused due to his ethnic affiliation, it cannot be said that such an expression was one that would deprive an "ordinary person" of the power of selfâcontrol. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These cases may be contrasted with the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin</i>, [1978] A.C. 705, in which the age of the accused was held to be a factor that could be taken into consideration. As in the case at bar, the accused Camplin was a male youth who had been victimized by a homosexual assault. He was subsequently laughed at by his assailant, at which point he lost his power of selfâcontrol and unleashed a mortal blow with a chapati pan. Lord Diplock indicated that the age of the accused could be taken into account by the jury by attributing this characteristic to the "ordinary person". In doing so, he expressly indicated, at p. 717, that age could be considered by the jury for two distinct purposes, namely (1) for the purpose of "assessing the gravity of the provocation addressed to the accused" and (2) for the purpose of "determining what is the degree of selfâcontrol to be expected of the ordinary person with whom the accused's conduct is to be compared". In other words, <i>Camplin</i> would allow a particular physical attribute such as the accused's age to be taken into account for the purpose of evaluating the gravity of the provocation. It would also allow particular mental attributes or personality traits such as the accused's immaturity to be taken into account for the purpose of determining the standard of selfâcontrol against which his conduct is to be measured. The former holding undermines the <i>Bedder</i> and <i>Parnerkar</i> line of cases, whereas the latter reasoning tends to undermine the objectivity of the "ordinary person" standard as expressed in <i>Lesbini</i>, <i>Salamon</i> and <i>Wright.</i></span></p>

This, however, does not conform to reality since an insulting remark or gesture has to be placed in context before the extent of its provocativeness can be realistically assessed.

It would stultify much of the mitigation of the previous harshness of the common law in ruling out verbal provocation as capable of reducing murder to manslaughter if the jury could not take into consideration all those factors which in their opinion would affect the gravity of taunts or insults when applied to the person whom they are addressed.</span></p>

In <i>Daniels</i>, <i>supra</i>, for example, where the accused was a woman who stabbed her husband's mistress during a verbal altercation, the jury obviously must take into account the factual context to the extent of recognizing that the accused's marriage had been broken up by the victim even though, following the reasoning in <i>Bedder</i> and <i>Parnerkar</i>, one could say that the "ordinary person" was not married to Mr. Daniels and would therefore not be similarly affected by a verbal slight from his mistress. </span></p>

This use of the accused's attributes does not, in my view, undermine the objective standard because it is done purely for the purpose of putting the insult into context and assessing its gravity. A certain type of jeer or derisive remark may mean something to a teenager and be meaningless to an adult. The insult to the accused in <i>Parnerkar</i> would only be perceived as an insult by a jury cognizant of the accused's race. The objective standard and its underlying principles of equality and individual responsibility are not, in my opinion, undermined when such factors are taken into account only for the purpose of putting the provocative insult into context.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By way of contrast, it would certainly undermine the principle of equality if the jury in <i>ParÂ­nerkar</i> were instructed to evaluate the accused in accordance with a standard of behaviour peculiar to his race. Whereas it is permissible to take into account factors such as the ethnic identity, language or physical infirmity of an accused for the purpose of giving the insult context, it would violate the principle of equality to assert that the reaction of a person of a certain ethnic or linguistic group to an insulting remark must be measured against a different standard from that applicable to others. Likewise, it would undermine the principle of individual responsibility if the jury in <i>Bedder</i> were instructed to fashion a special standard of behaviour against which to measure the actions of a person with his particular physical disability. Thus, impotent men are not excused for having a lower provocation threshold than that expected of "ordinary" people but rather are measured against the standard of an ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted. The objective standard applies to mental states rather than to attributes which simply go to placing the insult in its proper context. Accordingly, the most appropriate formulation of the objective standard in the first stage of the provocation defence is that of the ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted. The jury must be instructed to put themselves, as the embodiment of the ordinary person, in the accused's shoes to the extent that they perceive themselves as confronted with a remark that has the same insulting effect on them as the actual remark had on the accused. </span></p>

As indicated earlier, Lord Diplock allowed the age of the accused to be incorporated as an attribute of the "ordinary person" not only for the purpose of giving the insult context but also for the purpose of establishing the standard of selfâcontrol against which the youthful defendant should be measured. He specifically formulated this exception to the objective standard as an excuse premised on the sympathy which the courts must show for an accused who cannot meet the requisite standard of selfâcontrol when the usual objective standard is applied. In Lord Diplock's reknowned phraseology (at p. 717): "But to require old heads upon young shoulders is inconsistent with the law's compassion to human infirmity...." It is evident that this reasoning cannot be stated as a universally applicable principle since the special treatment accorded an accused who for some reason evokes the court's compassion necessarily embodies a violation of the underlying principles of equality and individual responsibility.</span></p>

Thus, in effect, he is stating that sixteen year olds cannot be held to the same level of selfâcontrol as can the "ordinary person" who is several years older. He is asking that youthful accused persons be treated unequally and not be held responsible for their actions in the same way as older accused persons.

On the other hand, the legal system has traditionally differentiated between children and adults to the extent that children may be denied the right to vote, to drink alcoholic beverages, etc. Indeed, this Court has held that the right to equality before the law in the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> is not violated by different penalties for criminal offences being imposed on youthful offenders from those imposed on their adult counterparts: <i>R. v. Burnshine</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 693. This position may be contrasted with the interpretation given to equality rights in <i>R. v. Drybones</i>, [1970] S.C.R. 282, where it was held that such differentiations are impermissible as between different ethnic groups.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This legal recognition of only partial rights and responsibilities invested in children is usually found in legislation and can often be attributed to policy considerations designed to ensure the protection of young people from their own actions and the actions of others or to protect others from the actions of young people. Such statutory measures as the prohibition of underage drinking, child labour laws establishing minimum ages for fullâtime employment, and licensing requirements restricting the operation of motor vehicles to persons over a certain age may be said to fit into this category. In addition, however, one finds indications in the law that the attribution of only partial rights to children goes beyond the legislative policy of the day and represents a principle upon which a great deal of common law thinking has been based. For example, from very early times the common law has deemed children as lacking the capacity to contract: <i>Wittingham v. Hill</i> (1619), Cro. Jac. 494; 79 E.R. 421. Similarly, the standard of care in negligence has been adjusted so that a child will not be measured against the same objective standard as an adult: <i>McEllistrum v. Etches</i>, [1956] S.C.R. 787. Thus, in a variety of different contexts, the law has recognized a general incapacity in children to act in a fully rational and responsible manner and has accordingly refrained from the rigorous application to them of the principles of equality and individual responsibility applied to adults. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concern over the legal responsibility of children for their actions has to some extent been addressed by Parliament in the <i>Young Offenders Act,</i> 1980â81â82â83, (Can.), c. 110. Persons under certain specified ages who are charged with criminal offences are removed from the usual adjudicative process and dealt with in specially devised forums. The statute is silent, however, on how children are to be treated who do not fall within its provisions for special procedures. Specifically, it does not address the concern the law has always had over holding young people, who for many purposes are not equal to adults in their legal rights and responsibilities, to a standard of behaviour which embodies this precise notion of equality of responsibility. Thus, the fact that some children are by virtue of this legislation completely removed from the ordinary processes of criminal justice does not answer the question how the actions of young people who do come before the ordinary criminal courts are to be evaluated.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, if the legal system is to reflect accurately the view of children as being in the developmental stages <i>en route</i> to full functioning capacity as adults, the standard against which children's actions are measured must be such as can logically culminate in the objective standard of the ordinary person upon their arrival at full adulthood. In negligence law, for example, whereas an extremely young infant assumes almost no legal liability for his or her actions (Walmsley v. Humenick, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 232 (B.C.S.C.)), older children are expected to conform to the standard appropriate for ordinary children of the same age: see Fleming, <i>The Law of Torts</i> (6th ed. 1983), pp. 107â08. Accordingly, it has been determined that the standard of care applicable to children is only partially objective in that it must be adjusted incrementally in accordance with the age of the child in question: <i>McHale v. Watson</i> (1966), 115 C.L.R. 199 (Aust. H.C.) At some point, of course, there must be a cutâoff so that the fully objective standard of the ordinary person can operate. Until this point is reached it stands to reason that the reduced legal standard of responsibility to which children are held is reflected in the semiâobjective standard of the ordinary thirteen year old, fourteen year old, etc.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying this reasoning to the case at bar, the standard of the ordinary person applicable to adults raising the provocation defence must be adjusted to an incremental scale reflecting the reduced responsibility of the young accused. The measure of selfâcontrol properly applicable to the respondent, therefore, is that of the ordinary sixteen year old. This is not, however, conceptually premised on what Lord Diplock refers to as the law's "compassion for human infirmity" since such compassion, in my view, finds its proper place only in the sentencing process. Rather, the incorporation of the accused's age into the objective "ordinary person" standard is an attempt to reflect the extent of the legal rights and responsibilities of children in the legal system. The law treats all persons as equal members of society and holds them responsible on an equal basis for their actions except to the extent that they are in a developmental stage en route to achieving full adulthood and full legal rights and duties. This process of maturation into fully responsible actors in the legal system is reflected in the incrementally adjusted measure of legal responsibility accorded to the actions of youthful accuseds. </span></p>

The submission rather is that the sex of the accused may be considered for the purpose of putting the wrongful act or insult into context and, as Lord Diplock expressed it in <i>Camplin</i>, "assessing the gravity of the provocation addressed to the accused". It seems to me that if the objective test is, as I have concluded, the "ordinary person" similarly situated and similarly insulted, then the fact that the victim of the sexual assault, the accused, is a male and that the attack is a homosexual one may properly be considered.</span></p>

The jury must be directed to consider any facts which make the wrongful act or insult comprehensible to them in the same way as it was comprehended by the accused and then, having appreciated the factual context in which the wrongful act or insult took place, must measure the accused's response to this insult against the objective standard of the ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted.</span></p>

This reduction in the standard against which young accused persons are measured merely reflects the fact that the law does not attribute to individuals in the developmental stage of their youth the same degree of responsibility as is attributed to fully adult actors. This developmental process is properly embodied in an incrementally adjusted formulation of the "ordinary person" test in accordance with the age of the accused. In this way the basic principles of equality and individual responsibility are embodied in the test to an extent commensurate with the age and capacities of the accused.</span></p>

In assessing the reaction of the ordinary person to a sexual assault it is the ordinary person who is a male subjected to a homosexual assault which must be considered.</span></p>

The jury may well, on the basis of the judge's charge and having regard to the existing state of the jurisprudence in Canada, have rejected the respondent's defence because they measured his conduct against a higher standard.

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion the age of the accused is relevant in a case such as this to the standard of selfâcontrol of the ordinary person rather than to the gravity of the provocation. With respect, this appears to me to have been the view of Lord Diplock in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin</i>, [1978] A.C. 705. I think this appears clearly from Lord Diplock's use of the words "power of selfâcontrol" and "standard of selfâcontrol" in association with the age of the accused on pp. 717â18, and particularly from what he said on p. 718 should be the judge's direction to the jury: "He should then explain to them that the reasonable man referred to in the question is a person having the power of selfâcontrol to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him...". I am content, with great respect, to accept the <i>rationale</i> or justification suggested by Lord Diplock for regarding the youth of an accused as relevant to the standard of selfâcontrol of the ordinary person.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree, however, with Wilson J. that sex is not relevant to the standard of selfÂ­control of the ordinary person, but it was obviously relevant in this case to the nature and gravity of the provocation claimed by the accused. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues have quoted the relevant passages in the trial judge's charge to the jury. The critical words for purposes of the issue in the appeal are those which appear in the direction with reference to the requirement that the accused must have acted upon the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool. After telling the jury that they must first decide whether the words and acts "were sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his selfâcontrol", the trial judge said: "If you find that they were, you will then secondly consider whether the accused acted on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool. In deciding this question you are not restricted to the standard of the ordinary person. You will take into account the mental, the emotional, the physical characteristics and the age of this accused." With great respect for what the Chief Justice has said with reference to the common sense of the average jury, I have been unable to avoid the conclusion that it was a clear implication of this direction that the age of the accused should not be taken into consideration in deciding whether there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of selfâcontrol. The further reference to age in a later passage of the charge (which, because of what preceded it, must be regarded as also related to the requirement that the accused must have acted upon the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool), could only serve to reinforce this impression, or at the very least to leave the jury with some confusion as to the relevance of age. This in my opinion is sufficient for the disposition of the appeal. It is one thing to consider whether the trial judge was required to make any reference to the relevance of the age of the accused in his charge to the jury; it is another thing to consider whether the reference which he did in fact make was misleading.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to what, if anything, the trial judge was required to say concerning the age and sex of the accused, I am inclined on the whole to agree with the Chief Justice, with some reservation concerning the question of age. The sex of the accused and its relevance to the gravity of the provocation claimed were, of course, obvious and did not require any observation from the trial judge. The relative youth of the accused would also presumably be obvious, but its relevance as a matter of law to the question whether there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of selfâcontrol might be less obvious to a jury and should probably have been drawn to their attention.</span></p>
