 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">An application for information concerning defence counsel’s fees in connection with a criminal prosecution involves the fundamental values of criminal law and procedure, such as the accused’s right to silence and the protection against self-incrimination.&nbsp; The preservation of those values leads to the conclusion that no&nbsp; distinction should be drawn between a fact and a communication in determining whether the solicitor-client privilege applies to lawyers’ billings for fees and disbursements.&nbsp; The existence of the fact consisting of the bill of account and its payment arises out of the solicitor-client relationship and of what transpires within it.&nbsp; That fact is connected to that relationship and must be regarded, as a general rule, as one of its elements.&nbsp; The fact consisting of the amount of the fees must therefore be regarded, in itself, as information that is generally protected by solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; While that presumption does not create a new category of privileged information, it will provide necessary guidance concerning the methods by which effect is given to solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; Because of the difficulties inherent in determining the extent to which the information contained in lawyers’ bills of account is neutral information, and the importance of the constitutional values that disclosing it would endanger, recognizing a presumption that such information falls <i>prima facie</i> within the privileged category will better ensure that the objectives of the solicitor-client privilege are achieved and helps keep impairments of solicitor-client privilege to a minimum.&nbsp; In this case, the Crown neither alleged nor proved that disclosure of the amount of the appellant’s billings would not violate the privilege that protected his professional relationship with his client and that information therefore had to remain confidential. </span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Deschamps J.:&nbsp; There was agreement with the conclusions of the majority regarding the deficiency of the information and regarding the crime exception.&nbsp; However, it is preferable not to characterize the amount of the fees paid by a client as a matter protected by solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; The ultimate purpose of this privilege is to enable every individual to exercise his or her rights in an informed manner.&nbsp; The protection extends to advice given in both criminal and civil cases, without distinction.&nbsp; Not all communications with a lawyer will be protected by privilege.&nbsp; It is the context in which the communication takes place that justifies characterizing it as privileged.&nbsp; In order to ensure that solicitor-client privilege continues to serve its purpose, the amount of the fees billed should not be protected unless, due to context, it is found to fall within the ambit of the privilege.&nbsp; Here, the amount of the fees and disbursements is relevant for the purpose of proving the charge of possession of the proceeds of crime or money laundering, but it does not provide any indication as to the nature of the legal advice given, and is not likely to draw a court into an examination of the advice given or the professional services performed by the lawyer.&nbsp; In a context in which the information discloses nothing, there is no reason to justify finding that the information is of as much importance as the legal advice itself.&nbsp; When a lawyer submits a bill of account, he or she does so as a supplier of a service.&nbsp; The lawyer’s relationship with the client is one of creditor to debtor.&nbsp; The amount owing takes on an identity distinct from the service itself.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not appropriate to grant it the same sort of protection given to the legal advice.&nbsp; It is in the interests of the administration of justice and of society in general for there to be greater transparency in respect of the amount of the fees that lawyers charge their clients.&nbsp; </span></p>

C.</i>”), to be unconstitutional, have been applied and developed.&nbsp; For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and set aside the appeal decision.&nbsp; Like the trial judge, I find that the common law rules that must govern authorizations to seize materials from lawyers’ offices, and the execution of those authorizations, were violated.&nbsp; As well, in my opinion, the lawyers’ billings must be deemed, in the context in which this case arose, to fall within the category of information protected by solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; It also seems to me that the crime exception was not properly relied on by the Court of Appeal and does not apply in this case.</p>

Normand Leblanc, a member of the RCMP, filed an application for authorization to search Mr.&nbsp;Maranda’s office.&nbsp; The application covered all documents relating to fees and disbursements billed to or paid by Mr.&nbsp;Charron.&nbsp; It also covered all documents relating to the ownership of a Bentley automobile that Mr.&nbsp;Charron had transferred to his lawyer, in payment for certain accounts for professional services, according to the police.</p>

Leblanc’s affidavit failed to meet the duty to establish that the things or information sought could not reasonably have been obtained by other means.&nbsp; Second, Béliveau J. stated that solicitor-client privilege, as defined by the common law rules that apply in criminal law, covers the amount of fees and disbursements billed by a lawyer to his or her client, even in the absence of any other details concerning the nature of the professional services rendered.&nbsp; Third, the trial judge concluded that the authorizing judge must, at this stage, try to minimize any violations of privilege and of the confidentiality of the information covered by it.&nbsp; The fact that there was no minimization clause could make the search unreasonable.&nbsp; The judge pointed out that in this case, merely inspecting the lawyer’s accounting records would have been sufficient to achieve the objectives of this search.</p>

C</i>. were likely to jeopardize the privileged nature of solicitor-client communications.&nbsp; This Court’s decision then clarified and strengthened the common law rules described in <i>Mierzwinski</i>.&nbsp; As defined in the reasons for judgment of Arbour J., those common law rules are meant to consolidate solicitor-client privilege, by placing the Crown under a clear duty to minimize any impairments of that privilege that might arise out of the search and seizure procedure.&nbsp; The rules are also intended to facilitate intervention by the lawyer concerned, by requiring that he or she be notified in time to be able to invoke the solicitor-client privilege in the information covered by the search warrant effectively:</p>

The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, which stressed the social importance of that privilege, whose purpose is to protect the confidentiality of communications between solicitor and client (<i>R. v.

Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 1999), at pp. 713-15; <i>Gruenke</i>, at pp. 286-87).</p>

Burgess</i>, [1989] S.J. No.&nbsp;240 (QL) (Q.B.); <i>R. v. Joubert</i> (1992), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 553 (B.C.C.A.)).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal also relied on a decision, in which I wrote the reasons, where it had concluded that solicitor-client privilege, in Quebec law, did not protect the information contained in billings that did not contain any details concerning the nature of the services rendered (<i>Kruger Inc. v. Kruco Inc.</i>, [1988] R.J.Q. 2323 (C.A.)).&nbsp; Other judgments have taken a position in favour of applying privilege in those circumstances.&nbsp; The most important of those judgments is undoubtedly the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in <i>Stevens v. Canada (Prime Minister)</i>, [1998] 4 F.C. 89.&nbsp; In that case, although it dealt with the problem of applying federal access to information legislation, Linden&nbsp;J.A. had concluded that the amount of fees fell within the framework of the solicitor-client relationship and had to be protected (paras. 29-30).&nbsp; His reasons stressed the importance of the information that able counsel could sometimes extract from apparently neutral information such as the mere amount of the fees paid by opposing counsel’s client (para.&nbsp;46) (see also, for example: <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms </i>(1988), 55&nbsp;D.L.R. (4th) 577 (B.C.C.A.);<i> Madge v. Thunder Bay</i> <i>(City)</i> (1990), 72&nbsp;O.R. (2d) 41 (S.C.);<i> Municipal Insurance Assn. of British Columbia v.

B-1, s.&nbsp;75; <i>By‑law respecting accounting and trust accounts of advocates</i>, R.R.Q. 1981, c.

In my view, this approach&nbsp; promotes the due administration of justice, since it protects all communications made by the client to his or her lawyer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, while not unduly impairing the search for truth.&nbsp; I am therefore of the view that it is preferable not to characterize the amount of the fees paid by a client as a matter protected by solicitor-client privilege.&nbsp; On the question of the rules that apply to the issuance of a warrant, I am of the opinion, like LeBel J., that the information was deficient.&nbsp; I also concur with his conclusions regarding the crime exception.</p>

I believe that the moneys spent by Alain CHARRON (DOB: 48-06-08) and referred to above are profits derived directly from his activities in connection with narcotics trafficking.</p>

McClure</i>, [2001] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 445, 2001 SCC 14, offers another example of an exception: when an accused’s innocence depends on privileged information being admitted in evidence, the court will be justified in authorizing disclosure.&nbsp; In any case, finding these exceptions is not a task to be undertaken lightly: <i>R. v. Brown</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 185, 2002 SCC 32.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

B-1, r. 1, contains provisions regarding how fees are to be established:</p>

R.C.</i>, [2003] R.J.Q. 2027 (C.A.).&nbsp; I therefore believe that in order to ensure that solicitor-client privilege continues to serve its purpose, the amount of the fees billed should not be protected unless, due to context, it is found to fall within the ambit of professional privilege as defined in <i>Solosky</i>.</p>

Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2002] 3&nbsp;S.C.R. 209, 2002 SCC 61, I would conclude, like LeBel J., that the issuing judge should have attached conditions to the warrant to ensure that the intrusion inherent in the search was minimized.&nbsp; The facts do not indicate that there was any particular urgency, and there was no allegation made from which it might be believed that the lawyer had participated in the crime.&nbsp; It would have been easy to notify him.&nbsp; His participation would have made it possible to conduct the search with due regard for the premises concerned.&nbsp; The information sought was narrowly focussed and the lawyer was in the best position to direct the search efforts of the officers responsible for executing the warrant.</p>
