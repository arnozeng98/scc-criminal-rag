(dissenting):&nbsp; The threshold test for leaving the defence of provocation with the jury has not been met in this case.&nbsp; With respect to the objective element of the test, there is no evidence on which a reasonable jury, acting judicially, could find a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive the ordinary person of the power of self‑control.&nbsp; The victim's statements prior to the shooting or the fact that he may have positioned the accused's wife between himself and the accused cannot constitute a wrongful act or insult.&nbsp; Those actions are not contemptuous or scornful; they are legitimate reactions to a dangerous situation.&nbsp; As well, the fact that the victim had a personal relationship with the accused's wife is not a wrongful act or insult sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose the power of self‑control.&nbsp; It would be a dangerous precedent to characterize involvement in an extramarital affair as conduct capable of grounding provocation, even when coupled with the victim's reactions to the dangerous situation he faced.&nbsp; In any event, even if the objective element of the test for provocation had been met, the subjective element was not met since there is no evidence that the accused acted on the sudden.&nbsp; The accused's mind was not unprepared for the sight of his wife with the victim such that he was taken by surprise and his passions were set aflame.&nbsp; The accused had known of his wife's involvement with the victim for some time; he knew his wife wanted to leave him, and he had seen the victim with his wife earlier that day.&nbsp; The defence therefore should not have been left with the jury.&nbsp; This was an error that did not prejudice the accused.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

(3d) 538 (N.S.C.A.), at p. 542, that:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
