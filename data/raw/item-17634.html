He sought bail for the first time in respect of these charges on November&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2016, but his application was dismissed, as the judge was not satisfied that any terms of release would adequately address the risk that M would, if released, commit other offences or interfere with the administration of justice. Later that month, M sought a review of his detention order under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec520" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;520<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which was denied on the basis that the judge saw no significant change that would justify releasing M. In March 2017, Crown counsel asked the defence whether M wished to pursue a 90‑day bail review under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec525" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;525<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Given the existence of competing lines of authority, the British Columbia Supreme Court heard submissions from both parties on the correct approach to the review under s.&nbsp;525. It concluded that the correct test at a s.&nbsp;525 hearing involves a two‑step process: the accused must first convince the reviewing judge either that there has been an unreasonable delay in the proceedings on the Crown’s part or that the passage of time has had a material impact on the initial basis for detaining the accused, and, if either of these thresholds is met, the judge must then determine whether the detention of the accused remains justified within the meaning of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec515subsec10" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;515(10)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

Since M is no longer in pre‑trial custody, his appeal to the Court is moot; however, as guidance is needed to establish the correct approach to a detention review hearing under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec525" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;525<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, the Court exercised its discretion to hear the appeal on the merits.</span></p>

 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the Court must apply the principles of statutory interpretation to determine the correct approach to a detention review under s.&nbsp;525, and to explain the place of such a review within the larger context of pre‑trial custody in Canada. In Canadian law, the pre‑trial release of accused persons is the cardinal rule and detention, the exception. Yet practices vary widely in terms of when s.&nbsp;525 detention review hearings happen, whether they are mandatory, what factors are considered and which test is applied.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the s.&nbsp;525 hearing is to prevent accused persons from languishing in pre‑trial custody and to ensure a prompt trial. Parliament sought to achieve this purpose by subjecting lengthy pre‑trial detentions to judicial oversight at set points in time, by affording an opportunity to have a judge consider whether the continued detention of an accused person is justified, and by conferring on the judge a discretion to expedite the trial of an individual in pre‑trial detention. The right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause, which is enshrined in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">e<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, operates as a key organizing principle of Part XVI of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Release is favoured at the earliest reasonable opportunity and on the least onerous grounds. The experience of pre‑trial detention can have serious detrimental impacts on an accused person’s ability to raise a defence. It also comes at a significant cost in terms of their loss of liberty, the impact on their mental and physical well‑being and on their families, and the loss of their livelihoods. Parliament intended s.&nbsp;525 to operate as a safeguard. This section imposes an independent responsibility on the reviewing judge to consider whether the continued detention of the accused is justified, and establishes a discretionary mechanism designed to prevent unreasonable delay and to expedite the trials of individuals in remand.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The correct approach to the s.&nbsp;525 detention review is as follows. First, the jailer has an obligation to apply for the detention review hearing immediately upon the expiration of 90 days following the day on which the accused was initially taken before a justice under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec503" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;503<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Where there is an intervening detention order under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec520" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;520<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec521" target="_blank">521<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> or<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec524" target="_blank"> 524<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> following the initial appearance of the accused and before the end of the 90‑day period, the 90‑day period begins again. Accused persons who have not had a full bail hearing are also entitled to a review under s.&nbsp;525, since the fundamental purpose of s.&nbsp;525 is to afford an opportunity to have a judge scrutinize the detention itself, and these individuals should not be denied that safeguard. Upon receiving the application from the jailer, the judge must fix a date and give notice for the hearing. The s.&nbsp;525 hearing is an automatic procedure, and the mandatory obligations to make the application and to fix a date lie with the jailer and the judge respectively. Form letters that place the burden on the accused to pursue a s.&nbsp;525 hearing are inconsistent with the law. The hearing must be held at the earliest opportunity. At the hearing, the reviewing judge may refer to the transcript, exhibits and reasons from any initial judicial interim release hearing and from any subsequent review hearings, and should show respect for any findings of fact made by the first‑level decision maker if there is no cause to interfere with them. Both parties are also entitled to make submissions on the basis of any additional credible or trustworthy information which is relevant or material to the judge’s analysis, and pre‑existing material is subject to the criteria of due diligence and relevance.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hearing, unreasonable delay is not a threshold that must be met before the detention of the accused is reviewed. Parliament did not intend to restrict the court’s ability to review the detention of an accused at a s.&nbsp;525 hearing to situations in which there has already been an unreasonable delay. The overarching question is only whether the continued detention of the accused in custody is justified within the meaning of s.&nbsp;515(10), which sets out three possible grounds on which the detention of an accused in custody may be justified: where it is necessary in order to ensure the attendance of the accused in court; where it is necessary for the protection or safety of the public; and where it is necessary in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. In determining whether the detention of the accused is still justified, the reviewing judge may consider any new evidence or change in the circumstances of the accused, the impact of the passage of time and any unreasonable delay on the proportionality of the detention, and the rationale offered for the original detention order, if one was made. If there was no initial bail hearing, the s.&nbsp;525 judge is responsible for conducting one, taking into account the time the accused has already spent in pre‑trial custody. Ultimately, s.&nbsp;525 requires a reviewing judge to provide accused persons with reasons why their continued detention is — or is not — justified. Finally, the judge should make use of his or her discretion under ss.&nbsp;525(9) and 526 to give directions for expediting the trial and related proceedings where it is appropriate to do so. Directions should be given with a view to mitigating the risk of unconstitutional delay and expediting the trials of accused persons who are subject to lengthy pre‑trial detention.</span></p>

C.</i>, and to explain the place of such a review within the larger context of pre-trial custody in Canada. For the reasons that follow, I find that Parliament intended s. 525 to operate as a safeguard. This section imposes an independent responsibility on the reviewing judge to consider whether the continued detention of the accused is justified, and establishes a discretionary mechanism designed to prevent unreasonable delay and to expedite the trials of individuals in remand. Given that Mr. Myers’ appeal is moot, I would simply allow the appeal and make no further order.</p>

He was charged with a number of offences, including intentionally discharging a restricted or prohibited firearm; occupying a motor vehicle knowing that there was a firearm in the vehicle; using a firearm in committing an indictable offence; possessing a restricted or prohibited firearm; and possessing a weapon and/or ammunition contrary to a lifetime firearms ban.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par6" class="">6</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Myers was already on bail for unrelated break and enter charges when he was arrested. He had various prior convictions, was on probation, and was under multiple court-ordered prohibitions against possessing firearms and ammunition. He was also the subject of a Canada-wide warrant for charges that had been laid in Alberta in 2015.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par7" class="">7</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of his arrest, Mr. Myers consented to detention without a bail hearing. About 4 months later, he pled guilty to the outstanding break and enter charges and was sentenced to 14 months incarceration. His release date in relation to those offences would have been in October 2016, taking time served into account. As of October 2016, Mr. Myers was no longer detained on any matter other than the new charges related to his arrest on January 4.</p>

He was in a reverse onus position at the bail hearing: s. 515(6) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> The judge considered the relative strength of the Crown’s case, Mr. Myers’ criminal record and, to a lesser extent, his other outstanding charges. The judge noted that Mr. Myers had a history of failing to follow court orders, and of then committing other offences. Defence counsel had submitted that Mr. Myers, who was only 26, had an opiate addiction and that it was the root cause of his criminal history. The defence proposed that Mr. Myers therefore be released into a residential drug treatment facility, and suggested cash bail, a daily reporting requirement, an ankle bracelet and electronic monitoring as additional conditions. However, the judge was not satisfied that any terms of release would adequately address the risk that Mr. Myers would, if released, commit other offences or interfere with the administration of justice. He therefore dismissed the application and ordered that Mr. Myers be detained on the basis of the ground set out in s. 515(10)(b).</p>

Counsel for Mr. Myers immediately sought a review of Mr. Myers’ detention under s. 520 on the basis of this new weakness in the Crown’s case. That review application was denied on the basis that the judge saw no significant change that would justify releasing Mr. Myers at that time.</p>

In the resulting hearing on July 21 of that year, given the existence of competing lines of authority, Riley J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court heard submissions from both parties on the correct approach to take under s. 525.&nbsp; His reasons for judgment were released on September 27, 2017.</p>

He found that the accused must first convince the reviewing judge either that there has been an unreasonable delay in the proceedings on the Crown’s part <i>or</i> that the passage of time has had a material impact on the initial basis for detaining the accused. If either of these thresholds is met, the judge must then determine whether the detention of the accused remains justified within the meaning of s. 515(10).</p>

However, he pled guilty on January 29, 2018 to one count of occupying a motor vehicle knowing there was a firearm in it under s. 94(1) <i>Cr. C.</i>, and one count of possessing ammunition contrary to a prohibition under s. 117.01(1) <i>Cr.

As he is no longer in pre-trial custody, the appeal is moot.</p>

Despite the fact that pre-trial detention is governed by federal law, there has been a widespread, and systemic, divergence in the approaches taken to 90-day detention reviews by courts across Canada. All the parties have made submissions to the effect that guidance from this Court is needed in order to determine which of these competing approaches should apply and to establish clarity in the law. The Court has therefore exercised its discretion to hear the appeal on the merits: see <i>Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at pp. 358-63.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par16" class="">16</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties suggest that the choice before this Court is between two competing approaches to s. 525 hearings. According to the first approach, unreasonable delay in getting the case to trial is a threshold condition. In the absence of an unreasonable delay, the judge at a s. 525 hearing cannot ask whether the detention remains necessary on the basis of the grounds set out in s. 515(10): see, e.g., <i>R. v. Gill</i>, 2005 CanLII 22214 (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v. Kissoon</i>, 2006 CanLII 40493 (Ont. S.C.J.); <i>R. v. Jerace</i>, 2012 BCSC 2007; <i>R. v. Whiteside</i>, 2016 BCSC 131; <i>R. v. Elmi</i>, 2016 BCSC 376; <i>R. v. Russell</i>, 2016 NLTD(G) 208, 34 C.R. (7th) 262; <i>R. v. Cheeseman</i>, 2017 NLTD(G) 114.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par17" class="">17</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the alternative approach, unreasonable delay is not a threshold condition. Instead, the judge at a s. 525<i> </i>hearing simply considers whether the continued detention of the accused is necessary on the basis of s. 515(10), and unreasonable delay is one possible factor in that analysis: see, e.g., <i>R. v. Thorsteinson</i>, 2006 MBQB 184, 206 Man. R. (2d) 188; <i>R. v. Sawrenko</i>, 2008 YKSC 27; <i>R. v. Sarkozi</i>, 2010 BCSC 1410; <i>R. v. McCormack</i>, 2014 ONSC&nbsp;7123; <i>R. v. Vandewater</i>, 2014 BCSC 2502; <i>R. v. Haleta</i>, 2015 BCSC 850; <i>R. v. Goudreau</i>, 2015 BCSC 1227; <i>R. v. Piazza</i>, 2015 QCCS 707.</p>

However, this case requires the Court to do more than simply choose one approach or the other. Like <i>Antic</i>, it concerns a provision of federal law that has been applied inconsistently across the country: paras. 6 and 65-66.&nbsp; Practices vary widely from place to place in terms of when s. 525<i> </i>hearings happen, whether they are mandatory, what factors are considered and which test is applied. It is up to this Court to apply the principles of statutory interpretation in order to resolve this issue.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par19" class="">19</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modern approach to statutory interpretation requires the Court to read the words of s. 525,<i> </i>‛‟in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”’: <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership&nbsp;v. Rex</i>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, both quoting E. Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i> (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87. When Parliament adopted s. 525, its purpose was clear and unambiguous. A straightforward reading of the provision, viewed properly in its legislative context, is the one which best supports that purpose.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par20" class="">20</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reference purposes, s. 525 is reproduced in its entirety in the attached Appendix together with ss. 515(10) and 526. While I will generally be referring to the “90-day” review, these reasons apply with equal force, and with any necessary modifications, to the “30-day review”, that is, they apply regardless of whether the accused is being prosecuted in proceedings by way of indictment or by way of summary conviction: s.&nbsp;525(1).</p>

In a speech at second reading in the House of Commons, then <span class="st">Justice Minister John N. </span><em><span style="font-style:normal">Turner summarized the purposes of the Act as follows:</span></em></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:13.7pt">The objectives of this bill are fourfold: First, to avoid unnecessary pre-trial arrest and detention; second, to ensure that in cases where arrest with or without warrant has taken place, the person accused, whatever his means, is not unnecessarily held in custody until his trial; third, to ensure an early trial for those who have been detained in custody pending trial; fourth, to provide statutory guidelines for decision making in this part of the criminal law process relating to arrest and bail and thereby preclude the possibility of “discretionary injustice”.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="margin-left:0in">(<i>House of Commons Debates</i>, vol. III, 3rd Sess., 28th Parl., February 5, 1971, at p. 3116)</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par22" class="">22</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court has recognized that Parliament’s overarching vision of the <i>Bail Reform Act</i> was the creation of ‘“a liberal and enlightened system of pre-trial release”’ in which accused individuals would normally be granted bail: <i>R. v. Morales</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 711, at p. 725, quoting <i>R. v. Bray</i> (1983), 40 O.R. (2d) 766 (C.A.), at p. 769; <i>Antic</i>, at para. 29. The purpose of that Act, which was influenced by both the academic work of Professor Martin L. Friedland and the findings of the Ouimet Report, as delivered by the Canadian Committee on Corrections examining the law on bail, was to reform a system that many experts saw as punitive, arbitrary, and inconsistent with the presumption of innocence: M. L. Friedland, <i>Detention before Trial: A Study of Criminal Cases Tried in the Toronto Magistrates’ Courts </i>(1965); Canadian Committee on Corrections, <i>Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections — Toward Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections</i> (1969). There was also particular concern regarding the relationship between prolonged pre-trial detentions and induced guilty pleas. In Minister Turner’s words:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">. . . there is an indication that those who are held under pre-trial detention will have, on the basis of statistics, a lesser opportunity for an acquittal and, certainly, they will have less of an opportunity to present a reasonable defence and assemble the evidence necessary for that defence. I think that we cannot ignore, either, Mr. Speaker, the high incidence of guilty pleas by persons who are detained and kept in custody under pre-trial detention. [p. 3115]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par23" class="">23</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third purpose of the <i>Bail Reform Act</i> as articulated by Minister Turner — to ensure an early trial for those who have been detained in custody — is of specific relevance to this appeal. It is a longstanding principle of our criminal justice system that individuals in pre-trial custody should be given a certain priority in scheduling trials. This general guiding premise has not been displaced by <i>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Jordan</i>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. Sections 525(9) and 526, which confer on the reviewing judge a discretion to give directions for expediting the trial of and any proceedings in relation to an accused, continue to operate as a reflection of that principle. In discussing these provisions, Minister Turner stated specifically:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">[T]here are important new proposals in the bill which provide that where an accused does not achieve bail after an arrest, there are methods for expediting his trial . . . . The provisions of the bill also ensure that where an accused is being held in custody pending his trial, or pending an appeal of his conviction, the situation must be reviewed by the courts within set periods of time, and directions may be given by the courts for getting the case on to trial. . . . [p. 3117]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par24" class="">24</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless of which test is applied, courts across Canada share an overarching consensus that the purpose of the s. 525 hearing is to prevent accused persons from languishing in pre-trial custody and to ensure a prompt trial: see, e.g., <i>Fraser Regional Correctional Centre v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, 1993 CanLII 354 (B.C.S.C.), at pp. 2-3; <i>Gill</i>, at para. 3; <i>Sawrenko</i>, at para. 26 (CanLII);<i> Sarkozi</i>, at paras. 8-11 (CanLII);<i> Haleta</i>, at paras. 8-10. It is, moreover, clear that Parliament sought to achieve this purpose by subjecting lengthy pre-trial detentions to judicial oversight at set points in time, by affording an opportunity to have a judge consider whether the continued detention of an accused person is justified, and by conferring on the judge a discretion to expedite the trial of an individual in pre-trial detention.&nbsp;</p>

In this case, the Crown relies almost exclusively on the heading under which s. 525 appears (“Review of Detention where Trial Delayed”) to support an argument that Parliament did intend to do so. In the Crown’s view, although the passage of 90 days might have been synonymous with “unreasonable delay” in 1972, this is no longer the case. The Crown suggests that Parliament has simply failed to amend the legislation in order to reflect the modern life cycle of a trial, and that s. 525 hearings were only ever intended to be held in exceptional circumstances involving unreasonable delay.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par30" class="">30</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In line with this view, some courts have developed a test to the effect that unreasonable delay is a precondition to reviewing the detention of the accused at a s.&nbsp;525 hearing: see, e.g., <i>Jerace</i>, at paras. 8-12 (CanLII). The Crown submits that the result of this interpretation of s. 525 is that the detention of the accused should rarely be scrutinized, because there will rarely have been an unreasonable delay when the 90-day mark is reached. The Attorney General of Ontario argues that the correct approach is one according to which the judge does not schedule a hearing at all unless he or she is satisfied that there has been an unreasonable delay.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par31" class="">31</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, the view that the judge <i>must </i>consider unreasonable delay but that the operative word for reviewing the detention of the accused is only “<i>may</i>”<i> </i>represents precisely the opposite of what the provision says:</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast"><b>(4)</b> If, following the hearing described in subsection (1), the judge is not satisfied that the continued detention of the accused in custody is justified within the meaning of subsection 515(10), the judge shall order that the accused be released . . . .</p>

C.</i>; <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-i-21-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">Interpretation Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-i-21-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 11<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>. Notably, the heading itself refers only to the trial being “delayed”, and <i>not</i> to an “unreasonable delay”, which suggests that Parliament simply intended the word “delayed” to refer to situations in which “the trial has not commenced” before the prescribed time. As well, the use of the word “any” in s. 525(3) makes it clear that there may or may <i>not</i> have been an unreasonable delay before the s. 525 hearing. Simply put, it is an error of law to treat unreasonable delay as a precondition for a review of the continued detention of the accused.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par33" class="">33</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no principled basis for this Court to “read in” a more restrictive test. It does not frustrate Parliament’s purpose to take the provision at face value, nor does it result in absurdity, waste or redundancy to do so. As the intervener Canadian Civil Liberties Association reminds us, “[t]oday, as before, three months is a long time for a person who is presumed innocent to be held in jail awaiting trial”: I.F., at para. 1. The Crown argues that this timeline is no longer realistic given the increased length and complexity of modern criminal trials. But even if that were true, the appropriate solution would be for Parliament to modify these clearly expressed requirements, not for this Court to read in a threshold that was never intended and that the words of the provision do not support. Circumstances that favour the release of the accused, issues related to unreasonable delay, or the need for a court to intervene to expedite the trial will not always have arisen when the 90-day mark is reached. Instead, 90 days following the last detention order against the accused is simply the point at which Parliament has specified that a judge must determine whether the continued detention of the accused is justified. The impact of the passage of time generally (and of unreasonable delay specifically) may be properly considered in the judge’s analysis at that time.</p>

C.</i> For indictable offences, as in Mr. Myers’ case, the relevant time is 90 days: s. 525(1)(a) <i>Cr. C.</i>&nbsp; The precise timing is made somewhat unclear by the use of the word “forthwith” in s. 525(1), which provides that the application must be made “forthwith on the expiration of those ninety . . . days”. The French version of the same passage connotes immediacy — “<i><u>dès</u> l’expiration de ces quatre-vingt-dix jours</i>” — and indicates more clearly that the obligation to make the application arises as soon as the 90-day period has expired.&nbsp; I would therefore take the provision to mean that the application must be made immediately upon the expiration of 90 days following (i) the date on which the accused was taken before a justice under s. 503, or (ii) the later of the date on which the accused was taken into custody and the date of a detention order under s. 520, 521 or 524.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par36" class="">36</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would pause to note that it has been suggested that an accused person could apply for a s. 520 review at some point before the end of the 90-day period only to have a s. 525 hearing held just weeks or days later, which would be wasteful or redundant: G. T. Trotter, <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i> (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at pp. 8-51 to 8-55. While this may have been an issue before amendments made to s. 525 in 1997 introduced a reference to s. 520 into s. 525(1)(a)(ii), it is no longer of concern: <i>Criminal Law Improvement Act, 1996</i>, S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 61(1). Section 525(1)(a)(ii) now indicates that the 90-day period is determined in relation to any order made pursuant to s.&nbsp; 521, 524 <i>or</i> 520.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par37" class="">37</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rule is therefore as follows: the person having custody of the accused must ordinarily apply to the judge immediately upon the expiration of 90 days following the day on which the accused was initially taken before a justice under s.&nbsp;503: s. 525(1)(a)(i) <i>Cr. C.</i> Where, however, a new detention order is made against the accused — or a decision is made to continue an existing order — under s. 520, 521 or 524 after the initial appearance of the accused under s. 503, the result of s. 525(1)(a)(ii) is that the 90-day period will effectively begin again. By way of example, if an accused person is taken before a justice under s. 503 and detained in custody on day 1, then applies to a judge for a review of that decision under s. 520<i> </i>on day 50 and the detention is confirmed, the jailer’s obligation to make the application will not arise until 140 days following the day on which the accused person was first detained in custody. In addition to conforming to the words of s. 525(1), this interpretation minimizes the risk of redundancy, addresses any concerns related to the scarcity of judicial resources and limits the applicability of s. 525 to situations in which the accused has actually been in custody for a long period without judicial oversight.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par38" class="">38</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v.

The deadlines imposed by Parliament for an application under s. 525 are known to and foreseeable by all involved, including the correctional facility, the Crown and the court. It may well be that administrative reforms are required in order to ensure that s. 525 applications are made on time every time, for every eligible accused person. Delays in routine bail and detention matters are a manifestation of the culture of complacency denounced by this Court in <i>Jordan</i>, and must be addressed.</p>
 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Judge’s Obligation to Fix a Date and Hold the Hearing</p>

C.</i> How much time the judge has after receiving the application before the date must be fixed is not specified. In fixing a date, the judge does not have a statutory discretion to refrain from holding the hearing until there has been an unreasonable delay or until she or he believes that the test for the release of the accused will be met. For a judge to do so would have the effect of creating a threshold condition for the hearing where it is plain that none exists in the language of s. 525. Moreover, such a practice could easily result in longer periods of unnecessary pre-trial detention than there would have been had the accused simply appeared before the judge at a properly conducted review hearing at the time Parliament intended. Thus, in order for the s. 525 hearing to fulfill its purpose of meaningfully safeguarding the accused person’s liberty, the jailer must make the application within the appropriate time limit, and the court must fix the date of the hearing without delay. And upon receiving the application from the jailer, the judge must schedule the hearing for the first available date.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par40" class="">40</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the hearing date, the Crown and the accused must appear before the judge. In oral argument in this Court, it was suggested that the judge could then routinely exercise his or her discretion to adjourn the s. 525 hearing until a later time.&nbsp; With respect, I disagree with this position. I am prepared to accept that occasionally, and in limited circumstances, an adjournment could be compatible with the purpose of s. 525 and with Parliament’s intent. However, as with the process of fixing a date for the hearing, it would be improper to adjourn merely because the judge does not believe that a full review of the detention would result in the release of the accused or because an unreasonable delay has not yet occurred.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par41" class="">41</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That being said, an adjournment should not be precluded where it clearly serves the interests of justice and the underlying purposes of the provision. For example — without limiting the foregoing — where a key piece of information is missing or a key event is pending, it would be entirely appropriate for the judge to adjourn the hearing until such time as the detention of the accused can be meaningfully assessed. The reviewing judge’s exercise of this supervisory authority must ultimately be guided by the overarching purpose of the provision, which is to prevent an accused person from languishing in pre-trial custody and to ensure a prompt trial by subjecting lengthy detentions to judicial oversight. As a result, adjournments must always be used in a manner that safeguards and is consistent with the right of the accused to a prompt and thorough review of his or her detention when the 90-day mark is reached. Reviewing judges must rely on good sense and experience in order to ensure that adjournments enhance rather than undermine the purpose of the s. 525 detention review.</p>

This would primarily be the case for individuals in a reverse onus position who have consented to remand, but it could also arise in other narrow circumstances. There is some disagreement over whether such an individual is entitled to a s. 525 hearing: see, e.g., <i>Sarkozi</i>, at para. 32; <i>R. v.

In theory, every accused person in custody will have been “taken before a justice under section 503” within the meaning of s. 525(1) and is therefore entitled to a hearing under s. 525. More to the point, the fundamental purpose of s. 525<i> </i>is to afford an opportunity to have a judge scrutinize the detention itself, and individuals who find themselves in these exceptional circumstances should not be denied that safeguard. I would echo the view that those who, for whatever reason, do not contest their initial detention “should not be punished for doing so, by depriving them of the potential benefits of s. 525 hearings, especially where their liberty and constitutional right to a trial within ‘a reasonable time’ is implicated”: <i>Saulnier</i>, at para. 10.</p>

The mandatory obligations to make the application and to fix a date lie with the jailer and the judge, respectively. In this case, the Crown sent defence counsel a letter in which it invited him to reply in order “to advise whether [Mr. Myers] wishes to pursue a bail review at this time, and if so, to arrange a mutually convenient date”: Appellant’s Condensed Book, Tab 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Form letters which place the burden on the accused to pursue a s. 525 hearing are inconsistent with the law. Such letters may disproportionately confuse or discourage unrepresented individuals, who are in particular need of the judicial oversight Parliament intended to ensure when it enacted s. 525. There may be circumstances in which an accused person, fully informed of his or her rights and the purpose of the provision, will decline what is intended to be an automatic hearing under s. 525. However, the words, the context and the purpose of the provision do not support an interpretation to the effect that s. 525 hearings are an “opt-in” affair.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par45" class="">45</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The overarching question at the s. 525 hearing is clear from the words of the provision. Section 525(1) explicitly states that the judge’s role is “to determine whether or not the accused should be released from custody”. Section 525(3) provides that the judge may, “in deciding whether or not the accused should be released from custody”, take any unreasonable delay into consideration. Section 525(4) instructs the judge to order the accused person’s release if the judge “is not satisfied that the continued detention of the accused in custody is justified within the meaning of subsection 515(10)”.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par46" class="">46</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question that the judge must answer at a s. 525 hearing is therefore as follows: <i>Is the continued detention of the accused in custody justified within the meaning of s. 515(10)?</i>&nbsp; Section 515(10) sets out three possible grounds on which the detention of an accused in custody may be justified: where it is necessary in order to ensure the attendance of the accused in court; where it is necessary for the protection or safety of the public; and where it is necessary in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(5)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nature of the Detention Review</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par47" class="">47</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question in the s. 525 review — whether the continued detention of the accused is justified — is somewhat different in nature than the question at the initial bail hearing or in a review under s. 520 or 521. While ss. 520 and 521<i> </i>exist for the purpose of reviewing a prior order, a review under s. 525 is more properly characterized as a review of the detention itself. Yet there is no indication that Parliament intended the judge presiding a s. 525<i> </i>detention review hearing to reconduct the original bail hearing in its entirety simply because 90 days have elapsed. Mr. Myers himself concedes as much: he argues only that a s. 525 hearing requires a “multi-factorial analysis”: A.F., at para. 89. This means that the judge at the s. 525 hearing should in his or her analysis show respect for any findings of fact made by the first-level decision maker if there is no cause to interfere with them. Similarly, any balancing exercise or weighing of factors conducted by the initial bail judge must be reviewed in light of the time that has already elapsed and any other relevant considerations, as will be discussed below.</p>
 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau"><span style="text-decoration:none">(6)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Material Available to the Judge</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par48" class="">48</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 525 offers little guidance on the record available to the judge at the hearing. However, as Veale J. pointed out in <i>Sawrenko</i>, at para. 31, s. 525(8) serves to incorporate ss. 517 to 519, with any necessary modifications. Under s. 518(1), the prosecutor may show the circumstances of the alleged offence and the judge has a wide discretion to make inquiries, as well as to receive and consider any evidence “considered credible or trustworthy” in the circumstances of the case. The judge at the s. 525 hearing is therefore free to make inquiries about the case, as well as to rely upon the transcript, exhibits and reasons from any initial judicial interim release hearing and from any subsequent review.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par49" class="">49</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, both parties are entitled to make submissions on the basis of any additional “credible or trustworthy” information which is relevant or material to the judge’s analysis. The admissibility of any material that existed at the time of the initial bail hearing but was not presented at that point should also be governed by the criteria of due diligence and relevance discussed in <i>St-Cloud</i>, at paras. 130-35. In the context of a s. 525<i> </i>review, the judge must be particularly attentive to any new evidence or material change in the circumstances of the accused and to its impact on the question whether his or her continued detention in custody is justified. For example, the period of pre-trial detention may have afforded the accused person time to make arrangements for a suitable surety, develop a comprehensive release plan or take other steps that would negate the initial basis for his or her detention under s. 515(10).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par50" class="">50</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining whether the detention remains justified under s. 515(10), the judge should also consider whether the time that has already elapsed has had — or the anticipated passage of time will have — an impact on the appropriateness or proportionality of the detention. In particular, it is necessary to be sensitive to whether the continued detention of the accused person could erode public confidence in the administration of justice: see, e.g., <i>McCormack</i>, at para. 29 (CanLII).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par51" class="">51</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is ultimately a question of proportionality. In some cases, the passage of time will have no impact on the necessity of continued detention. In other cases, it may be a very strong indicator that the accused should be released, with or without conditions. Reviewing judges must be particularly alert to the possibility that the amount of time spent by an accused in detention has approximated or even exceeded the sentence he or she would realistically serve if convicted: see, e.g., <i>Sawrenko</i>, at para. 43. The assessment must be informed by the need to reduce the risk of induced guilty pleas, which are profoundly detrimental to the integrity of the criminal justice system. As was noted in <i>R. v. White</i>, 2010 ONSC 3164, “public confidence in the administration of justice, and in particular in the judicial interim release regime, would be substantially eroded by pre-trial incarceration of presumptively innocent individuals to the equivalency or beyond the term of what would be a fit sentence if [they were] convicted”: para. 10 (CanLII).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par52" class="">52</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Determining, for the purposes of this analysis, the sentence the accused would potentially receive is not an exact science, nor does it require an exhaustive inquiry. However, the judge’s analysis should account for the circumstances of the case that were known at the time of the hearing and reflect the relevant sentencing principles: <i>St-Cloud</i>, at para. 65.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par53" class="">53</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other circumstances, accounting for the elapsed time or anticipated passage of time may require a more nuanced analysis of its impact on the three grounds which justify detention under s. 515(10). In <i>St-Cloud</i>, the Court indicated that a lengthy delay between the hearing and the eventual trial may be considered in determining whether detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, which is the tertiary ground: para. 71. In this sense, the analysis is not only retrospective, but also forward-looking. For example, let us consider a scenario in which an individual is detained on the basis of s. 515(10)(c), and at the time of the first detention order his trial is only two months away. If the trial date is then rescheduled for a date two years later and remains many months away at the time of s. 525 hearing, the continued detention of the accused may no longer be proportionate, or necessary, for the purposes of this third ground: see also <i>R. v. Whyte</i>, 2014 ONCA 268, 119 O.R. (3d) 305, at paras. 39-43; <i>Piazza</i>, at paras. 71-81 (CanLII). In an appropriate case, it may also be possible for the judge to conclude that a hypothetical risk in relation to the primary or secondary ground is simply outweighed by the certain cost of the accused person’s loss of liberty or of a loss of public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par54" class="">54</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of this analysis, the judge may consider whether either party has been responsible for any <i>unreasonable</i> delay in the trial of the charge: s. 525(3) <i>Cr. C.</i> If an unreasonable delay in getting the case to trial can be attributed to one of the parties, that factor will be relevant in determining whether the continued detention of the accused is proportionate or appropriate. Thus, if the accused appears to have engineered an unreasonable delay in his or her own trial, the basis for making a release order will clearly be weaker, but if the Crown is responsible for an unreasonable delay, this will weigh in favour of release. While the term “unreasonable delay” in s. 525 clearly cannot have the same meaning as it does in the context of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s. 11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">b<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, the two can be seen to be conceptually related. That being said, not every delay in getting a matter to trial will be unreasonable, and the accused does not have a right to be at any particular point in the process when the 90-day mark is reached. The judge must therefore rely on his or her judgment and experience in determining what impact, if any, the passage of time and an unreasonable delay should have on the continued detention of the accused.</p>

While any previous bail decisions will be relevant and will likely inform the proceedings, reviewing judges must be careful not to simply “rubber-stamp” such decisions. As I noted above, s. 525 creates an independent safeguard function that is particularly important for unrepresented individuals, who may not have had the means, the capacity or the awareness to apply for a s. 520 review but are now appearing before a judge at a s. 525<i> </i>hearing. For example, if when the accused appears at the s. 525<i> </i>hearing it becomes clear that the initial bail judge made an error of law — perhaps by failing to apply the bail principles enunciated by this Court in <i>Antic</i>, at para. 67, — and that this resulted in an unnecessary detention, it would be wasteful to tell the accused at that point to make a separate application for a different review process under s. 520. &nbsp;The need to revisit an initial detention order will not arise in every case, and in the absence of a basis for judicial intervention, there is no need for a s. 525 hearing to become a protracted or formal proceeding. However, the judge must be alive to these issues when they arise, and must be prepared to respond to them appropriately.</p>

To give proper effect to s. 525 in such situations, the judge is required to conduct the full bail hearing “from the ground up” in accordance with the ladder principle articulated in <i>Antic</i>, taking into account the time the accused has already spent in pre-trial custody. I wish to mention here that it has been suggested that allowing a full bail hearing to proceed before a superior court judge at the s. 525 stage would encourage “judge shopping” or would afford the accused some kind of procedural advantage that would for him or her justify spending three months in custody. In my view, this argument strains credulity.&nbsp; To quote O’Neill J. in <i>McCormack</i>, “<span style="background:white">I am not at all sure that many jailed accused would ever resort to paying the 90 day price for that strategy”: para. 26.</span></p>

For these provisions to operate as meaningful safeguards against unreasonable delay and excessively long pre-trial detention, all stakeholders — including the prosecution, defence counsel and the courts — must take an active role in ensuring the timely progress of the trial.</p>

Individuals in pre-trial detention, who are presumed innocent, bear a particularly high cost in terms of loss of liberty while awaiting their day in court. The judge should always determine whether the case presents an appropriate occasion to exercise his or her discretion to give directions for expediting the trial and related proceedings under ss. 525(9) and 526. Also, a judge who finds that the continued detention of the accused is justified on the basis of the grounds set out in s. 515(10) must look ahead to ensure that the accused will not be in a “time served” position before the prospective trial date.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par60" class="">60</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In deciding whether to give directions under s. 525(9) or 526, the reviewing judge must consider all the circumstances of the case and any relevant submissions by the parties. Relevant factors could include the relative complexity of the case, the involvement of co-accused individuals, the completeness of disclosure, problems related to evidence, the presence of any exceptional circumstances and the typical delay in getting comparable matters to trial in the jurisdiction in question. The analysis should be forward-looking.&nbsp; It should also be realistic, as the purpose of s. 525 is not to provide a pretext for judicial micro-management. Usually, the case will be proceeding at an acceptable pace and no directions from the court will be required. However, there may sometimes be a need, for example, to review the state of the Crown’s disclosure to the defence, resolve an outstanding procedural issue or inquire into whether an earlier trial date can be secured. In these circumstances, a considered, principled and proactive intervention of a reviewing judge can have a real impact on the fairness and efficiency of the criminal justice process, and meaningfully safeguard the liberty interests of the accused.</p>

This can hardly be what Parliament intended in enacting s. 525. There is no question that accused persons have a right to understand the purpose of the hearing, regardless of whether they are represented by counsel. All participants in our criminal justice system bear a fundamental responsibility for ensuring that this is the case. In reality, the individuals who are at the greatest risk of languishing in custody are those who are unrepresented. Where an accused is fully informed and supported by counsel, a s. 525 hearing may be a brief formality or may be waived altogether. However where the state has not provided for some form of legal assistance and the rights of an unrepresented individual are concerned, the judge must take even greater care to safeguard the liberty of the accused in order to maintain public confidence in the justice system.</p>

First, the jailer has an obligation to apply for the hearing immediately upon the expiration of 90 days following the day on which the accused was initially taken before a justice under s. 503. Where there is an intervening detention order under s.&nbsp;520, 521 or 524 following the initial appearance of the accused and before the end of the 90-day period, the 90-day period begins again. Accused persons who have not had a full bail hearing are nonetheless entitled to one under s. 525. Upon receiving the application from the jailer, the judge must fix a date and give notice for the hearing. The hearing must be held at the earliest opportunity.&nbsp; In his or her analysis, the judge may refer to the transcript, exhibits and reasons from any initial judicial interim release hearing and from any subsequent review hearings. Both parties are also entitled to make submissions on the basis of any additional “credible or trustworthy” information which is relevant or material to the judge’s analysis, and pre-existing material is subject to the criteria of due diligence and relevance discussed in <i>St-Cloud</i>, at paras. 130-35.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par63" class="">63</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, unreasonable delay is not a threshold that must be met before reviewing the detention of the accused. The overarching question is only whether the continued detention of the accused in custody is justified within the meaning of s. 515(10). In determining whether the detention of the accused is still justified, the reviewing judge may consider any new evidence or change in the circumstances of the accused, the impact of the passage of time and any unreasonable delay on the proportionality of the detention, and the rationale offered for the original detention order, if one was made. If there was no initial bail hearing, the s. 525 judge is responsible for conducting one, taking into account the time the accused has already spent in pre-trial custody. Ultimately, s. 525 requires a reviewing judge to provide accused persons with reasons why their continued detention is — or is not —justified. Finally, the judge should make use of his or her discretion under ss. 525(9) and 526 to give directions for expediting the trial and related proceedings where it is appropriate to do so. Directions should be given with a view to mitigating the risk of unconstitutional delay and expediting the trials of accused persons who are subject to lengthy pre-trial detention.</p>
 <p class="Title1LevelTitre1Niveau-AltL"><span style="text-decoration:

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par64" class="">64</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will not carry out the full exercise of applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case, given that the appeal is moot and the accused has pled guilty. I will, however, make three brief observations.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par65" class="">65</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the 90-day period applicable to Mr. Myers’ s. 525 hearing should have begun on November 24, 2016, which was the date of his s. 520 review. At that point, his sentence for the unrelated break and enter charges had been served, and he was not detained on any other matter: ruling on judicial interim release application, at para. 34. However, counsel for Mr. Myers was not contacted with regard to a s. 525 hearing until 110 days later (on March 14, 2017): Appellant’s Condensed Book, Tab 8. The hearing itself did not take place until October 5, 2017, over 300 days after Mr. Myers’ s. 520 review. While it is true that this case is exceptional in that Riley J. was asked to give a preliminary ruling on s. 525, the fact remains that Mr. Myers waited a very long time for the hearing to occur. I would reiterate that when an accused is not required to be detained in custody in respect of any other matter for 90 days following a review under s. 520, the application for the hearing must be made immediately upon the expiration of 90 days, and the judge has an obligation to schedule that hearing without delay.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par66" class="">66</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, I would note that the parties faced various barriers in fixing a date for trial. Dates were offered in March, June, October and November 2017. Counsel for Mr. Myers submits that he offered to re-arrange his caseload to accommodate more dates and proposed to make considerable admissions based on the preliminary inquiry evidence in order to shorten the trial. He also applied unsuccessfully for severance of Mr. Myers from his co-accused, Mr. Richardson. Despite these efforts, a trial that was initially scheduled for late 2016 was ultimately set for March 2018, 4 months before the presumptive 30-month ceiling: <i>Jordan</i>, at para. 5. While this type of scheduling challenge is not uncommon, the delays were, as the Crown concedes, unfortunate. Nevertheless, scheduling issues caused by the fact that the Crown was proceeding jointly against Mr. Myers and Mr. Richardson appeared to have been a more significant factor in the delays than unreasonable behaviour on the part of either the Crown or the accused. It is possible that directions given under s. 525(9) or 526 could have prevented or mitigated the delays.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par67" class="">67</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Mr. Myers was detained exclusively on the basis of the second ground under s. 515(10), despite the fact that he had a release plan involving a closely supervised treatment facility to address his substance abuse problems and multiple proposals to address the concern that he posed a risk to the public. It was within the bail judge’s discretion to determine whether the release strategies presented by counsel addressed the risk that if released from custody, Mr. Myers would commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice within the meaning of s. 515(10)(b). That being said, judges and justices presiding over bail hearings should always give very careful consideration to release plans that involve supervised treatment for individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues. Release into treatment with appropriate conditions will often adequately address any risk raised under s. 515(10), and such a strategy is a less onerous alternative than provincial remand. It may also substantially address the root causes of the accused person’s alleged criminal behaviour and reduce the likelihood of future criminal conduct. In accordance with the principles articulated in <i>Antic</i>, we must not lose sight of the fact that pre-trial detention is a measure of last resort.</p>
