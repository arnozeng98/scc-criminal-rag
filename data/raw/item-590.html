 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused was charged with sexual offences against his natural daughter, the complainant, who was in his custody subsequent to the death of her mother.&nbsp; At trial, the issue was not who had committed the offences but whether the complainant should be believed.&nbsp; The complainant testified that the acts of sexual misconduct by the accused began in 1981 when she was eleven years old and continued for almost two years.&nbsp; According to her testimony, the acts occurred two or three times a week, progressing from fondling to oral sex, sexual intercourse and buggery.&nbsp; On occasion, she and the accused urinated on each other.&nbsp; To support her testimony, the Crown sought to introduce evidence that in 1975 the accused had had sexual relations with a 15‚Äëyear‚Äëold girl, M.H.S., the daughter of his common law wife, with whom he had also enjoyed a father‚Äëdaughter relationship.&nbsp; M.H.S., who was at the time already sexually active, testified that within a year of living in their home, the accused began making sexual advances towards her.&nbsp; It started with fondling and, ultimately, the accused had intercourse with her five or six times.&nbsp; In addition, oral sex and masturbation occurred.&nbsp; In his ruling on the</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> voir dire</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">, the trial judge set out the proper test for the reception of similar fact evidence but later stated that the admissibility of M.H.S.'s testimony depended on "whether the similarities are sufficient to show that the accused had common characteristics in the methods he used in the sexual acts with [the complainant and M.H.S.] and that it is likely that they are one and the same man".&nbsp; He admitted the evidence and, at the end of the trial, convicted the accused.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the similar fact evidence was properly admitted and upheld the conviction.&nbsp; This appeal is to determine whether the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the evidence was admissible, notwithstanding the trial judge's reference to identity and the distinctions relied on by the accused between the case alleged against him and the similar fact evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge did not err in admitting the evidence of M.H.S.&nbsp; He set out the proper test for the reception of similar fact evidence and clearly proceeded on the assumption that the evidence was</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> prima facie</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> inadmissible.&nbsp; The trial judge's concern with the degree of similarity between the two stories was proper.&nbsp; While his comment suggesting that the similar fact evidence related to the identity of the perpetrator, which was not in issue, was in error, his reasons for convicting show that he was not at all concerned with identity, and considered the central issue of the case to be whether the complainant should be believed.&nbsp; The fact that a trial judge misstates himself at one point should not vitiate his ruling if the preponderance of what was said shows that the proper test was applied and if the decision can be justified on the evidence.&nbsp; In the context of the ruling as a whole and all the circumstances, the error was not material and did not undermine the validity of the trial judge's decision.&nbsp; In general, however, a trial judge should, in cases involving highly prejudicial similar fact evidence, clearly indicate the issue to which the evidence is relevant.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt"> mens rea</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> is not in issue, similar fact evidence may be useful in providing corroboration.&nbsp; Indeed, where, as in this case, the word of the child alleged to have been sexually assaulted is pitted against the word of the accused, similar fact evidence may be helpful on the central issue of credibility.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it cannot be concluded from the similarities and dissimilarities between the evidence of the complainant and the similar fact evidence of M.H.S., and from the considerable lapse of time between the two alleged relationships, that the evidence necessarily fails the "high probative value" test.&nbsp; The fact that in each case the accused established a father‚Äëdaughter relationship with the girl before the sexual violations began might arguably go to show, if not a system or design, a pattern of similar behaviour suggesting that the complainant's story is true.&nbsp; The question then is whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; Even if the admissibility of the evidence is borderline, this Court should not interfere with the conclusion of the trial judge, who was charged with the task of weighing the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect in the context of the case as a whole.&nbsp; Where the law accords a large degree of discretion to a trial judge, appellate courts should be reluctant to interfere with the exercise of that discretion in the absence of a demonstrated error of law or jurisdiction.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; There is no special rule with relation to similar fact evidence in sexual offences.&nbsp; Similar fact evidence, to be admitted, must have relevance to an issue in the case other than to simply show a general disposition to commit the crime charged; and, if it does, its probative value must exceed its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; The identification of the probative value of the evidence is thus a crucial factor in the application of the similar fact rule.&nbsp; Evidence adduced solely for the purpose of showing propensity is inadmissible.&nbsp; In some circumstances, however, the acts of an accused are admissible, notwithstanding their tendency to show propensity, if those acts have a close or striking similarity to the act charged.&nbsp; The admission of similar fact evidence on this basis does not depart from the policy that evidence of propensity alone is not to be admitted.&nbsp; There is a distinction between evidence of general character and</span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> modus operandi</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

letter-spacing:-.15pt"> modus operandi</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt"> is tantamount to evidence that the accused left his calling card.&nbsp; The process of reasoning which connects the accused to the crime charged is the same as in the case of other evidence of identification and is distinguishable from the prohibited line of reasoning.&nbsp; In short, the basis for admitting the evidence is relevance other than mere propensity.</span></p>

It started with fondling and progressed from there.&nbsp; Ultimately, the accused had intercourse with her five or six times.&nbsp; In addition, fellatio, cunnilingus and masturbation occurred.&nbsp; In late 1975, M.H.S. moved out of the house to live with another man, with whom she also had intercourse.&nbsp; After returning briefly to her mother's home, she moved out for good at age seventeen.&nbsp;&nbsp; At eighteen she became a prostitute, and remained one for three years.</span></p>
