text-indent:.8in;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The trial judge reviewed the case law in which the use of such psychiatric evidence had been discussed (<i>i.e.,</i> <i>R. v. Lupien</i>, [1970] S.C.R. 263; <i>R. v. Robertson</i> (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 385 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. McMillan</i> (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v.

inter-ideograph;text-indent:20.9pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Evidence that the offence has distinctive features which identified the perpetrator as a person possessing unusual personality traits constituting him a member of an unusual and limited class of persons would render admissible evidence that the accused did not possess the personality characteristics of the class of persons to which the perpetrator of the crime belonged.</span></p>

inter-ideograph;text-indent:20.9pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I leave open, until the question is required to be decided, whether when the crime is one assumed to be committed by normal persons, <i>e.g.</i>, rape, psychiatric evidence is admissible to show that the accused is a member of an abnormal group, possessing characteristics which make it improbable that he committed the offence, <i>e.g.</i>, that he is a homosexual with an aversion to heterosexual relations.&nbsp; I am disposed, however, to think that such evidence is admissible.</span></p>

inter-ideograph;text-indent:20.9pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">With respect, I think the learned trial judge was in error, in that he ruled on the sufficiency of the evidence of Dr. Hill, not its admissibility.&nbsp; It was up to the jury to consider what weight should be given to the expert opinion.&nbsp; Crown counsel suggested on appeal that the trial judge was ruling on the qualifications of the expert witness to give the opinion that he did.&nbsp; I do not think that is a correct interpretation of the trial judge's reasons.&nbsp; Dr. Hill's qualifications are outstanding and no attempt was made at trial to challenge them. I think the trial judge was saying that Dr. Hill's personal experience in dealing with sex-offending physicians and the lack of scientific literature specific to such physicians did not justify Dr. Hill giving the opinion that he did.&nbsp; In my opinion, in restricting his interpretation of Dr. Hill's testimony to "doctors who commit sexual assaults on patients", the trial judge misapprehended the opinion of Dr. Hill and the broad psychiatric experience upon which it was based.</span></p>

text-indent:57.55pt;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Relevance is a threshold requirement for the admission of expert evidence as with all other evidence.&nbsp; Relevance is a matter to be decided by a judge as question of law.&nbsp; Although <i>prima facie</i> admissible if so related to a fact in issue that it tends to establish it, that does not end the inquiry.&nbsp; This merely determines the logical relevance of the evidence.&nbsp; Other considerations enter into the decision as to admissibility.&nbsp; This further inquiry may be described as a cost benefit analysis, that is "whether its value is worth what it costs."&nbsp; See <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> (3rd ed. 1984), at p.&nbsp;544.&nbsp; Cost in this context is not used in its traditional economic sense but rather in terms of its impact on the trial process.&nbsp; Evidence that is otherwise logically relevant may be excluded on this basis, if its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect, if it involves an inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate with its value or if it is misleading in the sense that its effect on the trier of fact, particularly a jury, is out of proportion to its reliability.&nbsp; While frequently considered as an aspect of legal relevance, the exclusion of logically relevant evidence on these grounds is more properly regarded as a general exclusionary rule (see <i>Morris v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190).&nbsp; Whether it is treated as an aspect of relevance or an exclusionary rule, the effect is the same.&nbsp; The reliability versus effect factor has special significance in&nbsp; assessing the admissibility of expert evidence.</span></p>

Béland</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, at p. 434, with respect to the evidence of the results of a polygraph tendered by the accused, such evidence should not be admitted by reason of "human fallibility in assessing the proper weight to be given to evidence cloaked under the mystique of science".&nbsp; The application of this principle can be seen in cases such as <i>R. v. Melaragni</i> (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 348, in which Moldaver J. applied a threshold test of reliability to what he described, at p.&nbsp;353, as "a new scientific technique or body of scientific knowledge".&nbsp; Moldaver&nbsp;J. also mentioned two other factors, <i>inter alia</i>, which should be considered in such circumstances (at p. 353):</span></p>

Not only however was the evidence which King called relevant to this case:&nbsp; its admissibility was placed beyond doubt by the whole substance of Lowery's case.</span></p>

Lupien</i>, <i>supra</i>, is a good starting point.&nbsp; It involved a respondent who was convicted of attempting to commit an act of gross indecency, and whose defence was that he lacked the requisite intent to commit the act because he thought his companion was a woman.&nbsp; He sought to prove his "lack of intent" by tendering psychiatric evidence which showed that he reacted violently against any type of homosexual activity and, therefore, could not have knowingly engaged in an act of gross indecency.&nbsp; Ritchie&nbsp;J. concluded, at pp. 277-78, that the evidence was admissible for the following reasons:</span></p>

Thompson</i> [(1917), 13 Cr. App. R. 61 at 81].&nbsp; In any event, it appears to me that the question of whether or not a man is homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually perverted is one upon which an experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express an opinion and that if such opinion is relevant it should be admitted at a trial such as this even if it involves the psychiatrist in expressing his conclusion that the accused does not have the capacity to commit the crime with which he is charged.</span></p>

Chard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;270.&nbsp; The basic rationale of these cases is that "normal" human behaviour is a matter which a judge or jury can assess without the assistance of expert evidence.&nbsp; Canadian cases have extended the exception to include what has been described as sexually deviant behaviour.&nbsp; See Rosemary Pattenden, "Conflicting Approaches to Psychiatric Evidence in Criminal Trials:&nbsp; England, Canada and Australia", [1986] <i>Crim. L.R.</i> 92, at p.&nbsp;100.&nbsp; The rationale underlying this extension is the relevance of the evidence based on the distinctiveness of the behavioural traits of either the putative perpetrator of the crime or the accused. This distinctiveness tends to exclude the accused from the category of persons that could or would likely commit the crime.</span></p>

text-indent:.8in;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">There are other reasons why the use of the term "abnormal" is no longer satisfactory.&nbsp; Even in medical circles there are differing views as to what constitutes abnormality.&nbsp; See Pattenden, <i>supra</i>, at p. 100, and David C. Rimm and John W. Sommervill, <i>Abnormal Psychology</i> (1977), at pp.&nbsp;31 and 32.&nbsp; Moreover, it imports a value judgment on the lifestyle of some groups in society.&nbsp; This is aptly illustrated by considering the statement of Lord Sumner in <i>Thompson v.

text-indent:57.55pt;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The difficulty in defining what is abnormal was recently referred to by McCarthy J.A. in <i>R. v. Garfinkle</i> (1992), 15 C.R. (4th) 254.&nbsp; At pages&nbsp;256-57, speaking for the court, he stated:</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:20.9pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">What dispositions are to be classified as abnormal, as outside ordinary human experience, for the purpose of admitting psychiatric evidence may be a difficult question.&nbsp; A disposition for sadism is clearly abnormal.&nbsp; Dispositions for violence (short of sadism or something akin thereto), or for dishonesty, are clearly too common to be classified as abnormal.&nbsp; In sexual offences, classification is less easy.&nbsp; However, it seems to me that, whether it be called pedophilia or something else, a disposition in an adult to use boys of 10 and 11 for sexual gratification must be classified as abnormal.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the present case, psychiatric evidence is admissible to show that Garfinkle does not have such a disposition.</span></p>

text-indent:57.55pt;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In my opinion, the term "distinctive" more aptly defines the behavioural characteristics which are a pre-condition to the admission of this kind of evidence.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.8in;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">How should the criteria for the admission of this type of evidence be applied?&nbsp; I find the following statement of Professor Mewett, <i>supra</i>, at p. 36, to be an apt characterization of the nature of the decision which the trial judge must make:</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The categorization of crimes into the "ordinary" and the "extraordinary" is therefore a legal question to be determined by the judge, as is the "normality" or "abnormality" of the accused <sup>__</sup> to the despair, no doubt, of psychiatrists.&nbsp; But admissibility of evidence is a legal question and depends primarily upon relevance, that is, upon its assistance to the trier of fact in his inference-drawing process, and this is governed, not by expertise, but by common sense and experience; words like "ordinary", "extraordinary" or "abnormal" are not meant to be scientific expressions but assessments of relevance and are thus clearly within the domain of the judge.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:57.55pt;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Before an expert's opinion is admitted as evidence, the trial judge must be satisfied, as a matter of law, that either the perpetrator of the crime or the accused has distinctive behavioural characteristics such that a comparison of one with the other will be of material assistance in determining innocence or guilt.&nbsp; Although this decision is made on the basis of common sense and experience, as Professor Mewett suggests, it is not made in a vacuum.&nbsp; The trial judge should consider the opinion of the expert and whether the expert is merely expressing a personal opinion or whether the behavioural profile which the expert is putting forward is in common use as a reliable indicator of membership in a distinctive group.&nbsp; Put another way:&nbsp; Has the scientific community developed a standard profile for the offender who commits this type of crime?&nbsp; An affirmative finding on this basis will satisfy the criteria of relevance and necessity.&nbsp; Not only will the expert evidence tend to prove a fact in issue but it will also provide the trier of fact with assistance that is needed.&nbsp; Such evidence will have passed the threshold test of reliability which will generally ensure that the trier of fact does not give it more weight than it deserves.&nbsp; The evidence will qualify as an exception to the exclusionary rule relating to character evidence provided, of course, that the trial judge is satisfied that the proposed opinion is within the field of expertise of the expert witness.</span></p>

text-indent:57.55pt;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I take the findings of the trial judge to be that a person who committed sexual assaults on young women could not be said to belong to a group possessing behavioural characteristics that are sufficiently distinctive to be of assistance in identifying the perpetrator of the offences charged.&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that the alleged perpetrator was a physician did not advance the matter because there is no acceptable body of evidence that doctors who commit sexual assaults fall into a distinctive class with identifiable characteristics.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the opinion of Dr. Hill, the trial judge was also not satisfied that the characteristics associated with the fourth complaint identified the perpetrator as a member of a distinctive group.&nbsp; He was not prepared to accept that the characteristics of that complaint were such that only a psychopath could have committed the act.&nbsp; There was nothing to indicate any general acceptance of this theory.&nbsp; Moreover, there was no material in the record to support a finding that the profile of a pedophile or psychopath has been standardized to the extent that it could be said that it matched the supposed profile of the offender depicted in the charges.&nbsp; The expert's group profiles were not seen as sufficiently reliable to be considered helpful.&nbsp; In the absence of these <i>indicia</i> of reliability, it cannot be said that the evidence would be necessary in the sense of usefully clarifying a matter otherwise unaccessible, or that any value it may have had would not be outweighed by its potential for misleading or diverting the jury.&nbsp; Given these findings and applying the principles referred to above, I must conclude that the trial judge was right in deciding as a matter of law that the evidence was inadmissible.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:57.55pt;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The Court of Appeal also supported the admissibility of the evidence on the basis that Dr. Hill's evidence tended to rebut alleged similarities between the evidence on the respective counts.&nbsp; On this point, Finlayson J.A. stated at p.&nbsp;178:</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Where, as here, the Crown alleges that the probative value of the similar fact evidence arises from the circumstance that the acts compared are so unusual and strikingly similar that their similarities cannot be attributed to coincidence, the defence is equally entitled to lead evidence as to features of the alleged acts which demonstrate dissimilarities....</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The judgment of the Court of Appeal was not supported on this ground either in the respondent's factum or in the oral argument.</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.8in;line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The use to which the jury could put the evidence was explained by the trial judge in his charge to the jury.&nbsp; The key passage in the charge in this respect was the following:</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-indent:20.9pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">If you conclude when considering any of the specific counts that evidence relating to any or all of the other counts is <u>so similar that common sense dictates the relevancy of such evidence</u> to one or more of the issues I mentioned earlier, then you may not must, draw the inferences to which I have referred.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The similarities, which were detailed by the judge, were with respect to the <i>modus operandi</i> of the perpetrator of the acts which were the subject of the individual counts.&nbsp; No objection was taken to this aspect of the charge.&nbsp; This use of the similar fact evidence relates to a different issue from the subject matter of the proposed evidence of Dr. Hill.&nbsp; As discussed above, the dissimilarities addressed in Dr. Hill's proposed evidence are not as to <i>modus operandi</i> but rather with respect to the comparative psychological make-up of the respondent on the one hand and the alleged perpetrator of the acts charged, on the other.&nbsp; Furthermore, whether a crime is committed in a manner that identifies the perpetrator by reason of striking similarities in the method employed in the commission of other acts is something that a jury can, generally, assess without the aid of expert evidence.&nbsp; As stated by the trial judge, it is a matter of common sense.</span></p>
