24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A mature woman with a mental disability was seen being put into the accused‚Äôs car parked outside the psychiatric hospital where the woman resided.&nbsp; After conducting a search which lasted over seven hours, the police located the car, with the woman and the accused, in a remote area.&nbsp; Her shorts and underwear were in disarray.&nbsp; She had bruises and scratches on her body. The woman made out-of-court statements to the police constable who found her and to the doctor who first examined her.&nbsp; Pointing to her injuries, she communicated that the man in the car had done it.&nbsp; The accused was charged with kidnapping and sexual assault.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The trial judge was told that the complainant would be unable to give detailed evidence in court since her mental development was equivalent to that of a three- or four-year-old child and her memory of the events was poor.&nbsp; Crown counsel applied to admit the earlier out-of-court statements made to the doctor and the police officer, some of which had been videotaped, as a substitute for the complainant‚Äôs direct testimony at trial.&nbsp; Defence counsel opposed the application, arguing that the out-of-court statements were unreliable and moreover were unnecessary in light of the complainant‚Äôs availability to testify in person.&nbsp; A <i>voir dire</i> was held on the issue.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Based on one doctor's testimony and the complainant‚Äôs videotaped statement, the trial judge found it unnecessary to have the complainant herself called at the <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; The out-of-court statements were admitted.&nbsp; The accused was convicted of kidnapping, acquitted of sexual assault, but convicted of assault causing bodily harm.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in admitting the hearsay evidence when the complainant herself was available to testify and there was no expert suggestion that she would suffer any trauma or adverse effect by appearing in court. The curative proviso of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>was applied to maintain the conviction with respect to kidnapping but the conviction with respect to assault causing bodily harm was quashed and a new trial was ordered.&nbsp; The Crown appealed against the setting aside of the assault verdict.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Major, Bastarache, Binnie and Arbour JJ.:&nbsp; The procedure adopted in this case raises two distinct though related issues, firstly the admissibility of the expert evidence at the <i>voir dire</i>, and secondly the admissibility of the complainant's out-of-court statements at the trial.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">With respect to the first issue, there was no necessity shown at the <i>voir dire</i> for the expert medical evidence.&nbsp; Trial judges are eminently qualified to assess such matters as ‚Äúchildlike mental condition‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor ability to sustain questioning‚Äù without expert assistance.&nbsp; The complainant was available to testify and there was no suggestion that she might be harmed thereby.&nbsp; At the time the expert testimony was called, there was no basis laid for its reception.&nbsp; The complainant herself did not testify.&nbsp; The expert evidence was thus improperly admitted at the <i>voir dire</i>. As a consequence, the trial judge had no admissible evidence on which to exercise a discretion to admit the complainant‚Äôs out-of-court statements. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">On the second issue, even if the expert medical evidence had been properly admitted and accepting the trial judge's view that the out-of-court hearsay evidence was ‚Äúreliable‚Äù, the trial judge nevertheless erred in finding its admission to be ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù.&nbsp; If a witness is physically available and there is no suggestion that she would suffer trauma by attempting to give evidence, as was the case here, that evidence should generally not be pre-empted by hearsay.&nbsp; There were no exceptional circumstances in this case to displace the general rule.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Stereotypical assumptions about persons with disabilities, be it testimonial competency or trauma, should be avoided. The video of the complainant‚Äôs out-of-court statement could not afford evidence of any subsequent deterioration in her recollection of the events or her ability to communicate them.&nbsp; The trial judge having misdirected himself on the admissibility issue, his ruling must be set aside and the majority decision of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal ordering a new trial on the assault charge affirmed.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√©, Gonthier and LeBel JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; While it is generally a prudent practice for the Crown to put the complainant forward as a witness in order for the trial judge to evaluate her testimonial capacity, it is not an absolute legal requirement in every case.&nbsp; The trial judge‚Äôs inquiry was much broader than a limited application of a test of mental competence.&nbsp; The trial judge must assess the whole condition of the witness and balance the potential value of the evidence which may result from <i>viva voce</i> testimony against the potential prejudice to the witness.&nbsp; Potential trauma to the witness is one instance in which the Crown is not obliged to call her before the court in order to establish necessity.&nbsp; Other possibilities include circumstances in which it would be harmful to the witness or serve no real purpose to do so.&nbsp; Here, it would have served no real purpose for the trial judge to examine the complainant on the <i>voir dire</i>, given the evidence of necessity already before him.</span></p>

Khan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531;&nbsp; <i>R. v. Smith</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; and <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 2000 SCC 40.&nbsp; See also J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 1999), at pp. 189-201.)&nbsp; When dealing with young children or people with mental disabilities, this approach seeks to address the necessity and reliability required for the admission of the evidence while at the same time safeguarding the dignity and integrity of the complainants or witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

What these situations will have in common is that the relevant direct evidence is not, for a variety of reasons, available. Necessity of this nature may arise in a number of situations. Wigmore, while not attempting an exhaustive enumeration, suggested at ¬ß 1421 the following categories:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">(2) The assertion may be such that we cannot expect, again or at this time, <u>to get evidence of the same value</u> from the same or other sources.... The necessity is not so great; perhaps hardly a necessity, only an expediency or convenience, can be predicated. But the principle is the same.</p>

Rockey</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 829, at para. 17.&nbsp; However, the case law does not mandate that any particular kind of evidence must be adduced in order to demonstrate necessity.&nbsp; As McLachlin J. viewed it, while writing for the majority in <i>F. (W.J.)</i>, at para. 41, necessity may be founded on ‚Äúthe facts and circumstances of the case as revealed to the trial judge, or from evidence called by the Crown‚Äù.&nbsp; In keeping with the overriding principle of flexibility, the key is that necessity be grounded in evidence that is appropriate to the circumstances.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Given her communication difficulties and the apparent limitations, if not absence, of her long time memory, it may readily be inferred that calling her as a witness would have merely confirmed what is already clear from the record the trial judge had before him.&nbsp; It would have also deprived her of that degree of respect that every disabled person is entitled to (see <i>Quebec (Public Curator) v.&nbsp; Syndicat national des employ√©s de l‚Äôh√¥pital St-Ferdinand</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 211, at para. 108, <i>per</i> L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√© J.).</p>

The trial judge had to assess the condition of the complainant as a whole.&nbsp; This involved matters which were outside his traditional expertise, and which required expert assistance.&nbsp; With this assistance, the judge was able to acknowledge the childlike mental condition of the complainant and&nbsp; her fragile emotional state in addition to her poor ability to sustain questioning.&nbsp; In the present case, the nurse gave factual evidence about the complainant‚Äôs&nbsp; character and condition.&nbsp; The doctors testified on the basis of both their observations of the witness and their professional experience in matters which fell squarely within their competence on questions that went to the medical and psychological condition of the witness.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the hearsay evidence was admitted and used in accordance with the relevant legal rules.</p>

(W.J.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; underscored the need for a sensitive and practical approach to those matters.&nbsp; While assessing the requirement of necessity, she held that courts should avoid preordained classifications.&nbsp; Instead, while circumstances warrant, they must look at the whole environment and use all the facts they already know. <i>&nbsp;</i>At&nbsp; paras. 36-37, she wrote:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Necessity&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; should not be approached on the basis that the case must fit into a preordained category.&nbsp; It is a matter of whether, on the facts before the trial judge, direct evidence is not forthcoming with reasonable effort.&nbsp; The reasons for the necessity may be diverse ‚Äî ranging from total testimonial incompetence to traumatic consequences to the witness of testifying.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This prudent approach should be used in the case of witnesses like the complainant who have the mental age of such a child.&nbsp; The absence of direct evidence should not lead courts to presume the absence of trauma nor that the experience would not&nbsp; adversely and painfully affect a victim like the complainant.&nbsp; The law in this area does not include any inflexible rule requiring courts to drag witnesses into the courtroom in cases where all the known circumstances indicate they will be unable to testify usefully.&nbsp; Such a situation was foreseen by McLachlin J. in <i>F. (W.J.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 41:</p>

24.4pt">1.&nbsp; The expert evidence was improperly admitted at the <i>voir dire</i>.&nbsp; Trial judges are eminently qualified to assess the testimonial competence of a witness.&nbsp; The trial judge, after all, was to be at the receiving end of the complainant‚Äôs communication, and could have determined whether or not she was able to communicate her evidence to him.&nbsp; If she had been called and it became evident that the trial judge required expert assistance to draw appropriate inferences from what he had heard her say (or not say), or if either the defence or the Crown had wished to pursue the issue of requiring an oath or solemn affirmation, expert evidence might then have become admissible to assist the judge.&nbsp; At the time the expert testimony was called, it had not been shown that expert evidence as such was necessary, and the testimony of Drs. Gillespie, Morley and Parsons was therefore inadmissible:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">2.&nbsp; Consequently, the trial judge erred in ruling at the conclusion of the <i>voir dire</i> that the complainant's out-of-court statements would be admissible at trial.&nbsp; Having dispensed with hearing from the complainant, and the expert medical testimony having been improperly admitted, the trial judge had no admissible evidence on which to exercise a discretion to admit the complainant‚Äôs out-of-court statements.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It is unnecessary, I think, for the respondent to rely on Nurse Miller‚Äôs testimony or for an appellate court to parse the conflicting interpretations of the other evidence.&nbsp; The principal concern with the <i>voir dire</i> has nothing to do with the trial judge‚Äôs assessment of the evidence that was given or his preference for one expert over another.&nbsp; The concern is with the evidence that was available but was <i>not</i> given.&nbsp; It comes down to the Crown's failure to pave the way for admission of the out-of-court statements either by calling the complainant to show that the testimonial competence she exhibited at the time of making the out-of-court statements had been lost, or by providing some other legally sound basis for excusing her non-appearance.</p>
