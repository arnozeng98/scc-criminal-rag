200%"><span lang="EN-GB">The military judge did not err in his application of s.&nbsp;39(1) of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; In interpreting the phrase “no more force than is necessary” in s.&nbsp;39(1), an inquiry should be made into whether the force used was “reasonable in all the circumstances”.&nbsp; The reasonableness of “all the circumstances” necessarily includes the accused’s subjective belief as to the nature of the danger or harm.&nbsp; It also includes an objective component, which requires that the subjective belief be based on reasonable grounds.&nbsp; In this case, the military judge did exactly what he was required to do: he determined whether the accused had used no more force than was necessary to defend his possession in all the circumstances based on both subjective and objective criteria.&nbsp; He accepted the sentimental value of the diploma from the accused’s perspective, and considered the risk of harm to which the diploma had been exposed by the wife’s throwing it on the floor. He also took into account the fact that the diploma was replaceable, the nature of the force used by the accused, the accused’s admission that he may have gone too far in the anger of the moment, and the wife’s extensive bruises.&nbsp; The military judge concluded that the accused lost his self‑control for a short period of time during which he “physically manhandled” his spouse causing her to fall and suffer injuries.&nbsp; The military judge found the use of such force in the circumstances to be disproportionate. This conclusion is eminently justified based on the legal and factual contexts.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; In this case, the military judge’s reasons fell short of the standard of adequacy set out in <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>, 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, because they do not explain the basis on which it could be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused used more force than was necessary.&nbsp; The military judge did cover the “what” of the case — the finding that the use of force was excessive — but he was also required to go further and describe “why” he reached the conclusion that he did.&nbsp; His reasons do not disclose to the accused or to the appellate court the required logical connection between the “what” and the “why”. </span></p>

R.E.M.</i>, 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, in which it was held unanimously that reasons for judgment “must be sufficient to fulfill their functions of explaining <u>why</u> the accused was convicted or acquitted, providing public accountability and permitting effective appellate review” (para. 15 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; In my view the military judge’s reasons in this case fell short of that standard.&nbsp; With respect, I therefore disagree with the disposition of the appeal by Justice Abella.</p>
