The Queen</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824, where the accused called evidence that his wife was psychopathic, making her the likely killer of an infant, the Court held that the Crown could adduce evidence of the accused’s similar disposition.&nbsp; Otherwise the jury would have been left with an entirely distorted picture.&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, where the defence had vigorously attacked the credibility of the Crown witnesses, making much of their criminal records, Dickson C.J. held that “a serious imbalance would have arisen” had the jury not been apprised of the accused’s criminal record (p. 690).&nbsp; This opened up the opportunity for a more extensive cross-examination on the accused’s criminal record that might otherwise be viewed as unduly prejudicial. Therefore, whether or not it is appropriate for the trier of fact to consider that the accused <i>may have</i> a motive to lie because of his or her interest in the trial will depend on the evidence and the issues raised at trial.</p>

line-height:200%">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>An absolute rule as proposed would also be contrary to established principles of appellate review.&nbsp; It should now be regarded as trite law that a trial judge’s reasons should be read as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the issues and the arguments at trial, together with “an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered”:&nbsp; <i>R. v. R.E.M</i>., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 16.&nbsp; Consistent with this approach, courts have not held that the trial judge commits an error of law simply by making reference to or taking account of an accused’s motive to lie.&nbsp; It all depends on the context: <i>R. v. Murray</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 230-31;<i> R. v. Poitras </i>(2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at paras. 15-19; <i>R. v. D. (S.)</i>, 2007 ONCA 243, 218 C.C.C. (3d) 323, at para. 37; <i>R. v. Parnell</i> (1995), 59 B.C.A.C. 291,<i> </i>at paras. 42-43; <i>R. v. Silverquill</i>, 1999 BCCA 128, 121 B.C.A.C. 126, at paras. 14-18; <i>R. v. Khuc</i>, 2000 BCCA 20, 132 B.C.A.C. 139, at para. 35; <i>R. v. Green</i>, 2002 BCCA 269 (CanLII), at paras. 11-12.</p>

line-height:200%">[17]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>In reviewing a trial judge’s reasons for disbelieving the accused, a court should also be mindful of the useful distinction drawn by Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), where he cautioned against reading a trial judge’s reasons as if they were an instruction to a jury.&nbsp; The Court has repeatedly endorsed his observations (at p. 204):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:200%">A trial judge’s reasons cannot be read or analyzed as if they were an instruction to a jury.&nbsp; Instructions provide a road‑map to direct lay jurors on their journey toward a verdict.&nbsp; Reasons for judgment are given after a trial judge has reached the end of that journey and explain why he or she arrived at a particular conclusion.&nbsp; They are not intended to be, and should not be read as a verbalization of the entire process engaged in by the trial judge in reaching a verdict.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">See for example <i>R.E.M</i>., at para. 18 and <i>R. v. C.L.Y.</i>, 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para.&nbsp;11, where Abella J. has endorsed this approach.&nbsp; Of course, it may be clear that a judge, in part of the reasons, is in fact describing the road-map or process he or she engaged in.&nbsp; Again here, any impugned passage in a trial judge’s reasons must be read in the context of the entire reasons.</p>

line-height:200%">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>It follows from these principles that the trial judge’s consideration of Mr.&nbsp;Laboucan’s “very great motive to be untruthful” must be placed within the context of the trial and the reasons as a whole.&nbsp; At the end of the day, the determining question is whether the trial judge’s comments undermined the presumption of innocence.&nbsp; The majority in the Court of Appeal concluded that they did.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; In my respectful view, the majority erred by effectively considering the impugned statement in isolation. As I read their reasons, the fact that “[t]he motivation was described as a motivation to be untruthful, not simply a motivation to be acquitted” (para. 22) effectively drove their conclusion.&nbsp; It mattered not what the trial judge wrote elsewhere in his reasons or in what context the words were chosen.&nbsp; In their view, the reference to the accused’s motivation to be untruthful, as opposed to his motivation to secure an acquittal, was irreconcilable&nbsp; with the teachings in <i>W. (D.)</i> and “constituted a material flaw in the assessment of credibility bearing upon the substance of the judgment” (para. 31).</p>

 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>As I indicated at the outset, I agree with Rowbotham J.A.’s conclusion that the trial judge committed no error.&nbsp; I am also in substantial agreement with her analysis.&nbsp; In my view, she considered the impugned comments in their appropriate context.&nbsp; In the “road-map” part of the judgment where the trial judge instructed himself on the law, she noted that he correctly instructed himself as to the applicable <i>W. (D.)</i> principles and the burden of proof.&nbsp; Therefore, this is not a situation where the reviewing court has to rely on the presumption that the trial judge knows the law on credibility.&nbsp; His reasons make it clear that he did.&nbsp; The trial judge then faithfully followed the principles he had set out in analysing the evidence.</p>

line-height:200%">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Rowbotham J.A. then reviewed at some length the numerous reasons given by the trial judge for disbelieving the accused’s testimony, at paras. 50-58.&nbsp; I need not repeat those reasons here.&nbsp; They are numerous and well founded in the evidence.&nbsp; They include: material inconsistencies between Mr. Laboucan’s evidence at trial and his evidence given at a preliminary inquiry; further inconsistencies between his evidence at trial and that given in statements to police; his admission that he had made up an elaborate fiction concerning a murder he had witnessed, where he implicated real people even though they had no involvement whatsoever in the actual murder at which he was present; the fact that there was no medical evidence to support his claim that he entered into a state of shock which prevented him from responding to the events at the scene; and the stark conflict between his evidence and the evidence of every other&nbsp; witness present at the scene.</p>

line-height:200%">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Finally, Rowbotham J.A. held that the comparison to the motivations of the witnesses in para. 202(e) was entirely appropriate in this case, given the defence position at trial.&nbsp; In my view, the defence position is a very important contextual factor that explains the language used by the trial judge.&nbsp; Central to this trial was the fact that the credibility of each of the main witnesses was challenged by Mr. Laboucan on the basis that they had a motive to lie and fabricate evidence against him, either to exculpate themselves in other proceedings or to minimize their participation in the crime.&nbsp; The trial judge was appropriately mindful of the defence position throughout his review of their evidence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>In these circumstances, where the defence theory rested on the contention that each witness who implicated Mr. Laboucan lied out of self-interest, it was entirely appropriate for the trial judge to consider that the witnesses would have had no, or less reason, to be untruthful on <i>particular points </i>of evidence in respect of which Mr.&nbsp;Laboucan provided radically inconsistent testimony.&nbsp; The trial judge’s careful and detailed review of the evidence belies any contention that Mr. Laboucan’s testimony was inappropriately isolated and subjected to greater scrutiny than the other witnesses on the basis of his status as an accused.&nbsp; Further, Mr. Laboucan’s testimony and position regarding the witnesses had implications for the co-accused, Mr. Briscoe.&nbsp; Therefore, unlike Rowbotham J.A. who concluded that the impugned comments were “harmless and unnecessary” (para. 63), it is my view that, within the context of this trial, it was a crucial and unavoidable aspect of determining the credibility issues that the trial judge consider Mr.&nbsp;Laboucan’s own motives.</p>
