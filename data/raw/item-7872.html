 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence established that Pickton frequented the [downtown eastside of Vancouver] DTES and used the services provided by sex trade workers.&nbsp; He lured these women away from their usual working areas to his Port Coquitlam farm 30 kilometres away by offering additional money, drugs, or both.&nbsp; A firearm consistent in its calibre and class characteristics with the gun used to kill three of the women was found in the laundry room of his residential trailer.&nbsp; Pickton had lived in this trailer, situated at the north end of the 17 acre farm, since 1997.&nbsp; Various restraint devices, some bearing DNA matched to Pickton, were found in his bedroom and in a duffle bag in the loft area of his workshop, one of a number of outbuildings at the north end of the property used by Pickton in his daily activities.&nbsp; Personal belongings and trace DNA of four of the six victims were found throughout Pickton’s trailer.&nbsp; Together with the recovered bodily remains, all this evidence was located within a 70 metre radius of his trailer.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pickton was a butcher by avocation.&nbsp; He had the tools of the trade and slaughtered pigs in his slaughterhouse on the farm on a weekly basis.&nbsp; The state of the remains of three of the victims (bisected skulls, hands and feet) showed unmistakable signs of having been butchered in a manner similar to the way Pickton butchered large pigs, including the vertical bisection of the skull using a saw and the removal of the hands and feet by a process known as disarticulation.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pickton told Andrew Bellwood that he lured sex trade workers from the DTES to his home, had sex with them, restrained them with handcuffs, strangled them with a piece of wire, butchered them in his slaughterhouse and disposed of their remains, including at a rendering plant.&nbsp; Pickton regularly disposed of barrels of offal at a rendering plant near the DTES.&nbsp; Recovered from the headboard of Pickton’s bed was a knotted length of insulated electrical wire capable of being used as a ligature.&nbsp; Pickton made no mention of others in his description of this scheme.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Bellwood and Ellingsen provided statements to the police recounting this confession and this eyewitness account before any remains of the victims had been found at the north end, Pickton’s end, of the farm.</span></p>

(dissenting, but not on this point) noted in <i>R. v. Rose</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262:&nbsp; “The notion that it is sufficient for the accused to respond to the ‘Crown theory of the case’ also suffers from the practical difficulty that the Crown’s theory of the case is a moving target that has to adjust to meet new or changing circumstances during the trial, including what the Crown hears in the defence closing address” (para. 27).&nbsp; Counsel also takes no issue with the principle that “a trial judge has a duty to instruct the jury on all routes to liability which arise from the evidence, even if the Crown chooses not to rely on a particular route”.&nbsp; He concedes that, as a general rule, the trial judge has that obligation (A.F., at para. 83).&nbsp; The issue, he argues, is whether in the particular circumstances of this case, the Crown’s so-called change in position and the trial judge’s amendment of the instructions after the jury asked their question undermined the fairness of the trial.&nbsp; In effect, he contends that the defence was unfairly taken by surprise by this turn of events.</span></p>

Ranger</i> (2003), 178 C.C.C. (3d) 375.&nbsp; In that case, Ranger and an individual named Kinkead were both charged with murder in relation to the stabbing of two sisters, but were tried separately.&nbsp; At Ranger’s trial, it was the Crown’s theory that Ranger, who had been in a relationship with one of the sisters and was upset over her intention to leave the country, had gone to her house to kill her and had enlisted Kinkead to help him.&nbsp; The Crown’s case, as put to the jury, relied on proving that Ranger and Kinkead were in the home together and that one or both had killed one or both sisters.&nbsp; Ranger’s defence was based, in part, on alibi evidence.&nbsp; Ultimately, the trial judge’s instructions left it open to the jury to find Ranger guilty, even if they did not accept that he was present at the time of the killings, if they were satisfied that he somehow aided or abetted Kinkead in the killings.&nbsp; In light of what had happened at trial, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was reasonable for defence counsel to have understood that Ranger’s conviction would be grounded on proving that he was in the house at the time of the murders.&nbsp; Consequently, by putting the additional theory to the jury without prior notice to the defence, the trial judge had undermined Ranger’s ability to make full answer and defence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify"><span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The defence team was composed of experienced criminal defence counsel who could not have failed to be aware throughout of a co-party route to liability, as much as they might have wished to avoid it by confining the Crown to its sole-perpetrator theory.&nbsp; Nor could they not have known of the legal duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury on any party route to liability that emerged from the evidence.&nbsp; They could not have confined the court in the manner they hoped to confine the Crown.&nbsp; An examination of the record makes this very apparent.&nbsp; [para. 121]</span></p>

While the wording contained in earlier drafts differed somewhat from para. 8 reproduced above (see discussion at paras. 250-51 of Donald J.A.’s dissenting reasons), the crux of the anticipated other suspects instructions was the same:&nbsp; it did not matter whether Mr. Pickton acted alone or with others, for he could be found criminally liable, provided that he “actively participated” in the killings, and thus had a physical role in them.&nbsp; As we shall see, the impugned answer to the jury question was consistent with this instruction. In answer to the question whether they could find that Mr. Pickton was the killer if they inferred that he “acted&nbsp; indirectly”, the members of the jury were ultimately instructed that they could do so, provided they found that he “was otherwise an active participant” in the killings.&nbsp; The contention that the defence was somehow taken by surprise by this course of events is not, therefore, borne out on the record.</span></p>

Thatcher</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, “[t]he whole point of s. 21(1) is to put an aider or abettor on the same footing as the principal” (p. 689).&nbsp; The determinative question is whether the trial judge correctly instructed the jury as to the essential elements which the Crown had to prove to establish Mr. Pickton’s liability for the murders.&nbsp; Clearly, he was guilty of murder if the Crown proved the elements of the offences as explained in the charge to the jury.&nbsp; I therefore conclude that there was no legal error.</span></p>

Bernardo</i> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 123 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 19: “[D]etached and reflective appellate review of the trial process is perhaps most important in notorious, emotion-charged cases involving the least deserving accused.” </span></p>

Even if the instruction receives a new label of “other suspects” liability, this cosmetic, rhetorical change does not dispel the error or change the reality of what happened during the trial. The re-charge whereby the trial judge instructed the jury that they could convict Mr. Pickton if they found he was the actual shooter or “was otherwise an active participant” in the killings clearly opened up party liability as an alternate route to conviction.&nbsp; That having been done, it was an error for the trial judge not to have left a full aiding and abetting instruction with the jury in order to set out the alternate route properly by which the jury could convict Mr. Pickton for the six murders with which he was charged. The phrases “active participation”, “acting in concert”, or “joint venture” do not in and of themselves adequately convey the law of party liability to a trier of fact.</span></p>

She concludes that “[t]he instructions could not have led the jury into improper reasoning” (para. 34). It is indeed hazardous to speculate on the process of the jury’s deliberation, but, the unusual verdict of second degree murder returned by the jury after they posed their question may well suggest that the instructions in this case were inadequate. However, as there exists on the record overwhelming evidence of Mr. Pickton’s guilt, and no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by this error in the instructions, I would apply the curative proviso found in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec686" target="_blank">s. 686<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;</span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Mr. Pickton was tried on six counts of first degree murder. The trial itself took almost a year to complete, and a total of 129 witnesses were called by both the Crown and the defence. Mr. Pickton himself did not testify, although the Crown relied on inculpatory admissions made by Mr. Pickton in a formal statement to the police, and later to an undercover officer in one of the police cells. The defence challenged the reliability and credibility of those inculpatory statements, as well as the testimony of a number of key Crown witnesses, and pointed to evidence that implicated at least two other individuals in the murders.</span></p>

The Crown relied on a similar fact inference to prove that the other victims had been murdered in the same manner.&nbsp; The logical conclusion from this accepted fact, as it was presented to the jury, was then that only one person, i.e. the person wielding the gun, could have caused the deaths of the victims in each of the counts, although others may have been involved to various degrees in the surrounding circumstances.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.8in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person commits an offence if he, alone or along with somebody else or others, personally does everything necessary to constitute the offence. Accordingly, it is not necessary for you to find that Mr. Pickton acted alone in order to find him guilty of the offence. You may find that Mr. Pickton acted in concert with other persons, although you may not know who they are. It is sufficient if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, having considered all the evidence, that he actively participated in the killing of the victim. It is not sufficient that he was merely present or took a minor role.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:46.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">It is not your concern whether some other person or persons have neither been charged or found guilty of the offence of murder.

It went on to consider whether the trial judge’s failure to relate the law of aiding and abetting to the evidence was an error in that case.&nbsp; In finding that the failure to do so was not wrong in that case, our Court stated:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:46.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of carving his jury charge into discrete sections in which he reviewed the evidence consistent with Thatcher having personally committed the murder, Thatcher having committed the murder by means of s. 21(1), and, finally, Thatcher not having committed the murder at all, the trial judge simply went through the evidence of each witness in turn. I do not think he was wrong in this. <u>Much of the Crown evidence was consistent with either Crown theory, and much of the defence evidence was consistent with either Thatcher’s innocence or his guilt under s. 21(1).</u> It is not incumbent on a trial judge to go through the evidence in a repetitive fashion which could only have bored the jury. Nor do I think we should assume jurors are so unintelligent that they will fail to see the obvious: the presence of a government car at the home of the victim, when combined with evidence suggesting that the man in the car was not Thatcher, may point to Thatcher’s having aided and abetted; and surely they can discern that the alibi evidence, if believed, when combined with the murder weapon evidence, may point to a similar conclusion.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:46.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, it is obvious that the two Crown theories are not legally different views of what happened. <u>The whole point of s. 21(1) is to put an aider or abettor on the same footing as the principal.</u> To stress the difference between the Crown theories might leave a jury with the erroneous impression that it is vital for the jurors to decide individually and collectively which way the victim was killed.

First, if there is evidence admitted at trial which properly supports an alternate mode of liability under s. 21, an instruction on that section should be left with the jury, even though the identity of the other participant or participants is unknown, and even though the precise part played by each participant may be uncertain. Second, it is not necessary for the trial judge to relate the law to the evidence which could support the alternate theory of aiding and abetting where evidence adduced by the Crown relates to either mode of participation, and evidence adduced by the defence relates to either the accused’s innocence or the accused’s guilt under the relevant subsection(s) of s. 21. Finally, a jury need not be unanimous on the nature of the accused’s participation in the offence, so&nbsp; long as it is satisfied that the accused either committed the offence personally or, alternatively, aided and abetted another to commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did one or the other.</span></p>

The potential liability of Mr. Pickton as an aider and abettor was not before the jury in any meaningful way. It therefore cannot be said that the jury was properly informed of the legal principles which would have allowed them as triers of fact to consider evidence of Mr. Pickton’s aid and encouragement to an unknown shooter, as an alternative means of imposing liability for the murders.</span></p>

As stated by the majority of this Court in <i>R. v.

McMaster</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 740.&nbsp; In a joint beating case, since each accused commits each element of the offence of murder (the entire <i>actus reus</i> and <i>mens rea </i>of the offence), and only factual causation may be uncertain (which person delivered the “fatal” blow), legal causation will allow for uncertainty as to the actual act which caused the death.&nbsp; The only requirement for “causation of death” is that related to murder/manslaughter generally. It must be established that each accused’s assault of the victim was a “significant contributing cause” (for manslaughter or murder generally) or an “essential, substantial and integral part of the killing” (for first degree murder under s. 231(5)): <i>Nette</i>, at para. 73.</span></p>

Indeed, many other offences without causal requirements would lend themselves more clearly to a “co-principal” type situation, as they are offences which are often committed by more than one person, such as robbery, kidnapping, or breaking and entering. In those cases, the <i>actus</i> <i>reus </i>or acts that make up the offence can extend over minutes or hours or days, and different elements or portions of the offence can be completed by different persons (if one person breaks the window of a premises, and both persons enter it, they are both still actually committing the same break and enter).&nbsp; In this way, co-principal liability can arise whether the acts of each accused are committed sequentially (one acts first, the other acts second, and the <i>actus reus </i>of the offence is only complete after the second act), or whether the acts are concurrent (both accused persons act at the same time, each committing the entire <i>actus reus</i>).</span></p>

Whether one assault, or some combination of the two, caused the death is irrelevant for co-principal liability, as long as both assaults are found to be a “significant contributing cause” of death.</span></p>

The insertion of the words “or was otherwise an active participant in [the] killing” impermissibly opened up the possibility of Pickton’s having acted <i>as an aider and abettor</i> without any further instruction on that route of liability.</span></p>

 <p class="1" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">[</span><a class="" name="par81"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">81</span></a><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a final note, there appears to have been some uncertainty, during the course of the trial, as to whether similar fact evidence could have been used to support an alternate theory of aiding and abetting, had Mr. Pickton’s liability for the murders as a party under s. 21 been left with the jury (see the respondent’s factum at p. 53, fn. 25, concerning the potential applicability of the decision in <i>R. v. Mercer</i>, 2005 BCCA 144, 202 C.C.C. (3d) 130, leave to appeal refused, [2005] 2 S.C.R. x). This may have been the source of the Crown’s decision to proceed strictly on a “sole perpetrator” theory, as the admission of similar fact evidence was crucial to a conviction on all counts, and particularly in relation to counts 4 through 6.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="1" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">[</span><a class="" name="par82"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">82</span></a><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This problem was addressed by Low J.A. for the majority of the Court of Appeal, in finding that the admission of count-to-count similar fact evidence was not restricted to the sole perpetrator route to liability. Justice Low explained that such evidence “was admissible because of a pattern of events and a pattern of conduct linking the appellant to those events that merited consideration on each count of the evidence on all counts, and the evidence of Ellingsen [one of the witnesses] on all counts” (para. 177). Furthermore, he concluded that no special instruction to the jury was required with respect to that evidence, and that <i>R. v. Perrier</i>, 2004 SCC 56, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 228, did not apply to this case:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:46.0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No such link [as explained in <i>Perrier</i>] became necessary in the present case. The evidence was capable of establishing that the appellant was the one constant in the sequence of events that I have described more than once in these reasons. In admitting the similar fact evidence, the trial judge was satisfied that there was evidence tending to connect the appellant to all six murders, an issue not contested by the appellant at trial or on appeal. There was no suggestion, even by the defence, that there might have been a group of murderers and that the appellant might have been a participant in one or more of the murders but not in the others. The evidence supported the conclusion that the appellant committed each of the killings or that he actively participated in each of them (or one or more of them) in concert with another person. I agree with the Crown that the probative value of the similar fact evidence was the same regardless of the route to criminal liability each juror preferred. The concern addressed in <i>Perrier </i>does not arise. [para. 181]</span></p>

But the requisite pattern of conduct must be sufficiently connected to both possibilities on all of the counts.</span></p>

Van</i>, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at para. 34). </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%"><span style="color:black;letter-spacing:.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Other errors may be more serious, but the proviso will also apply because there is overwhelming evidence of the guilt of the accused and, on that evidence, a properly instructed jury would necessarily return a verdict of guilty (<i>R. v. Trochym</i>, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, at para. 82). In my view, this is the case in the instant appeal. As mentioned above, there were serious errors in relation to a key issue at trial, criminal participation in the offences, in both the instructions to the jury and in response to its question. Nevertheless, in order to assess the possible impact of these errors, the context of the trial as a whole must be kept in mind.</span></p>

I will not attempt to review here all of the evidence offered by the Crown during what was a very long trial. However, on a review of the record, in my opinion, the Crown presented compelling, overwhelming evidence of the participation of Mr. Pickton in the murders. From whichever perspective we consider the participation of Mr. Pickton, on the evidence, he was necessarily either a principal or an aider or abettor. It would surpass belief that a properly instructed jury would not have found him guilty of murder in the presence of such cogent evidence of his involvement. Indeed, this properly instructed jury would likely have convicted Mr. Pickton of first degree rather than second degree murder.</span></p>

Despite the errors set out above, there was no miscarriage of justice occasioned by the trial proceedings. Mr. Pickton was entitled to the same measure of justice as any other person in this country. He received it. He is not entitled to more.</span></p>
