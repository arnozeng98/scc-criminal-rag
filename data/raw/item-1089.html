 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, s. 56(2)(<i>a</i>) provides that, along with the requirement of the specific procedures in s. 56(2)(<i>b</i>), the statement must be voluntary.&nbsp; Further, s. 56(1) provides that subject to the specific requirements of the rest of the section, the law relating to the admissibility of statements made by persons accused of committing offences applies in respect of young persons.&nbsp; The effect of these two subsections is clearly to incorporate the common law relating to the voluntariness of statements made by accused persons, including any special requirements applicable in the case of young persons.&nbsp; An analysis of the common law with respect to advising a young person over age 14 of the possibility of being tried in adult court demonstrates that this was considered to be an important consideration in determining voluntariness where the statement was tendered in adult court following a successful transfer application (<i>R. v. Yensen </i>(1961), 130 C.C.C. 353 (Ont. H.C.)).&nbsp; In <i>Yensen</i>, McRuer C.J.H.C. stated at p. 358 that while he did not have to decide the case on this ground (the young person not having been properly warned as to his right to remain silent), he had "very grave doubts" as to the right to use the statement of a juvenile in adult court "unless great care is taken to give a full explanation to the accused that that is the course that events might take."&nbsp; Likewise, in cases where, as here, the statement was only offered as evidence in youth court, the absence of such a warning was held to be an important factor in determining whether or not the statements were voluntary (<i>R. v. D.M. and J.P.</i> (1980), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 373 (Ont. Prov. Ct.); <i>R. v. A.</i> (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 537 (Alta. S.C.T.D.)).&nbsp; It is important to note, however, that in none of the above cases was it held to be a hard and fast rule in all cases that a young person over 14 years of age be warned that they could be raised to adult court.&nbsp; Rather, the presence or absence of such a warning was one factor to be considered in determining whether the statement was voluntary.</span></p>

Strachan</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, a majority of this Court, <i>per</i> Dickson C.J., endorsed the approach of Le Dain J. in <i>Therens</i> with respect to the necessary connection to operationalize s. 24(2), stating the following in that regard, at pp. 1001-2:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Therens</i> and held that it did not stand for the proposition that s. 24(2) requires a causal nexus.&nbsp; In his view the language of s. 24(2) militated against such an interpretation.&nbsp; If present, a causal link was one factor to take into account in the later s. 24(2) determination whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. . . .</span></p>
