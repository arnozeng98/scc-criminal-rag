Sometime during the next 48 hours, she died from asphyxiation.&nbsp; During an RCMP undercover operation, the accused told a police officer that he had been involved in the robbery and death. The accused was charged with first degree murder under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec231subsec5" target="_blank">s. 231(5)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> -- murder while committing the offence of unlawful confinement -- and tried before a judge and jury.&nbsp; At trial, he claimed that he had fabricated the admission. He testified that he had gone alone to the victim‚Äôs house only with intent to break and enter, that the back door to the house was open as though someone already had broken into the home, and that he left after finding the victim already dead in her bedroom.&nbsp; The trial judge charged the jury on manslaughter, second degree murder and first degree murder under s. 231(5) of the <i>Code</i>. In response to a request from the jury that he clarify the elements of first degree murder and the ‚Äúsubstantial cause‚Äù test, the trial judge essentially reiterated his charge. Overall, he charged that the standard of causation for manslaughter and second degree murder was that the accused‚Äôs actions must have been ‚Äúmore than a trivial cause‚Äù of the victim‚Äôs death while, for first degree murder under s. 231(5), the accused‚Äôs actions also must have been a ‚Äúsubstantial cause‚Äù of her death. On two occasions, however, once in the main charge and once in the re-charge, he described the standard of causation for second degree murder as ‚Äúthe slight or trivial cause necessary to find second degree murder‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmore than a trivial cause‚Äù.&nbsp; The jury found the accused guilty of second degree murder and the Court of Appeal upheld that verdict.&nbsp; The only ground of appeal both before the Court of Appeal and this Court concerned the test of causation applicable to second degree murder. </span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Iacobucci, Major, Binnie, Arbour and LeBel JJ.: Responsibility for causing a result, in this case death, must be determined both in fact and in law. Factual causation concerns how the victim came to death in a medical, mechanical, or physical sense and the accused‚Äôs contribution.&nbsp; Legal causation concerns the accused‚Äôs responsibility in law and is informed by legal considerations such as the wording of the offence and principles of interpretation. These considerations reflect fundamental principles of criminal justice. The inquiry to find legal causation can be expressed as determining whether the result can fairly be said to be imputable to the accused. Although the jury does not engage in a two-part analysis of causation, the charge to the jury should convey the requisite degree of factual and legal causation. The starting point is usually the unlawful act itself.&nbsp; It will rarely be necessary to charge the jury on the standard of causation if the requisite mental element for the offence exists because the <i>mens rea</i> requirement usually resolves concerns about causation.&nbsp; The law of causation is in large part judicially developed but it is also expressed in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Where a factual situation does not fall within a statutory rule of causation, the criminal common law applies. The civil law of causation is of limited assistance in elucidating the criminal standard of causation.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">It is not appropriate in jury charges to formulate a separate causation test for second degree murder. The causation standard expressed in <i>Smithers </i>is still valid and applicable to all forms of homicide. The standard, however, need not be expressed as ‚Äú</span>a contributing cause of death, outside the <i>de minimis</i> range‚Äù. The concept of causation and the terminology used to express that concept are distinct. Latin expressions or the formulation of the test in the negative are not useful means of conveying an abstract idea. It is preferable to use positive terms such as ‚Äúsignificant contributing cause‚Äù rather than ‚Äúnot a trivial cause‚Äù or ‚Äúnot insignificant‚Äù.&nbsp; Also, because causation issues are case-specific and fact-driven, trial judges should have discretion to choose terminology relevant to the circumstances of the case. In the case of first degree murder under s. 231(5) of the <i>Code</i>, a jury must also consider the additional <i>Harbottle</i> ‚Äúa substantial causation‚Äù standard but only after finding the accused guilty of murder.&nbsp; This standard, which indicates a higher degree of legal causation, comes into play at the stage of deciding whether the accused‚Äôs degree of blameworthiness warrants the increased penalty and stigma of first degree murder.&nbsp; Such a high degree of blameworthiness would only be established where the actions of the accused were found to be an essential, substantial and integral part of the killing of the victim. The <i>Harbottle</i> standard stresses the increased degree of participation required before an accused may be convicted of first degree murder under s. 231(5).</p>

<div class="Section5">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The difficulty in establishing a single, conclusive medical cause of death does not lead to the legal conclusion that there were multiple operative causes of death.&nbsp; In a homicide trial, the question is not who or what caused the victim‚Äôs death but whether the accused caused the death. The fact that other persons or factors may have contributed to the result may or may not be legally significant in the trial of the one accused charged with the offence.&nbsp; It will be significant, and exculpatory, if independent factors, occurring before or after the acts or omissions of the accused, legally sever the link that ties him to the prohibited result. This case involves neither multiple causes nor intervening causes nor a thin-skull victim so it was unnecessary to instruct the jury on the law of causation beyond stating the need to find that the accused caused the victim‚Äôs death. However, in relation to the charge of first degree murder under s. 231(5) of the <i>Code</i>, it was necessary for the trial judge to instruct the jury in accordance with <i>Harbottle</i>.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt">The trial judge accurately stated the correct standard of causation for second degree murder. Although, on two occasions, he misspoke in describing the appropriate test, by contrasting the high standard of causation for first degree murder with ‚Äúthe slight or trivial cause necessary to find second degree murder‚Äù, these errors would not have caused the jury to believe that the applicable standard of causation for second degree murder was lower than the <i>Smithers</i> standard of ‚Äúmore than a trivial cause‚Äù. Given that the jury found the accused guilty of second degree murder, it must be concluded that the jury found that the accused had the requisite intent for the offence of murder, namely subjective foresight of death. The jury‚Äôs conclusion with respect to intent could not have been affected by the instructions on causation.&nbsp; No reasonable jury could have had any doubt about whether the accused‚Äôs actions constituted a significant, operative cause of the victim‚Äôs death. Whatever the jury‚Äôs reasons for acquitting the accused of first degree murder, the jury‚Äôs verdict of second degree murder is unimpeachable.</p>

24.4pt"><i>Per</i> McLachlin C.J. and L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√©, Gonthier and Bastarache JJ.: The test for causation for culpable homicide set out in <i>Smithers</i> should not be changed from ‚Äúa contributing cause of death, outside the <i>de minimis</i> range‚Äù into ‚Äúa significant contributing cause‚Äù.&nbsp; The current language is the correct formulation and should be used to express the standard of causation to the jury for all homicide offences. To avoid a Latin expression, an appropriate version would be ‚Äúa contributing cause [of death] that is not trivial or insignificant‚Äù. The terms ‚Äúnot trivial‚Äù and ‚Äúnot insignificant‚Äù accurately express a standard that has withstood the test of time as an authoritative test of causation.

24.4pt">There is a meaningful difference between ‚Äúa contributing cause [of death] that is not trivial or insignificant‚Äù and a ‚Äúsignificant contributing cause‚Äù. The suggested change in terminology drastically changes the substance of the causation test and ignores the reason for using a double negative. A ‚Äúsignificant contributing cause‚Äù standard calls for a more direct causal relationship than the ‚Äúnot insignificant‚Äù or ‚Äúnot trivial‚Äù test, thus raising the threshold of causation for culpable homicide from where it currently stands.&nbsp; The word ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù implies an elevated contribution and is not equivalent to ‚Äúnot insignificant‚Äù.&nbsp; It is crucial to use exact language because language is the medium through which law finds expression and language is an outward sign of our legal reasoning.<b> </b>Trial judges should continue to use the current language of ‚Äúa contributing cause [of death] that is not trivial or insignificant‚Äù for all homicide offences.</p>

24.4pt">I submit that there is a material difference between describing something as ‚Äúnot an insignificant cause‚Äù on the one hand, and as ‚Äúa significant cause‚Äù on the other.&nbsp; To ignore this difference is to ignore the reason for the use of a double negative in the first place.&nbsp; While the former description focuses the inquiry at the lower end of the scale of degrees of causation, the latter does not invoke such a focus.&nbsp; Using another set of words to illustrate my argument, when Mary says that she does not dislike John, she means, at most, that she is impartial towards him rather than that she likes him.</p>

Likewise, to consider things that are not dissimilar to be similar would amount to an erroneous interpretation. In the same vein, a substantial difference exists between the terms ‚Äúnot insignificant‚Äù and ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù, and there is no doubt in my mind that to remove the double negative formulation from the <i>Smithers </i>causation test<i> </i>would effect a radical change to the law. I therefore agree with the position of both the respondent and the intervener that a ‚Äúsignificant contributing cause‚Äù calls for a more direct causal relationship than the existing ‚Äúnot insignificant‚Äù or ‚Äúnot trivial‚Äù test, thus raising the standard from where it currently stands. As the respondent explains (see paras. 74 and 76 of the respondent‚Äôs factum):</p>

24.4pt">It is further submitted that the term ‚Äúsignificant cause‚Äù can also imply too high a causation standard. Like the term substantial, <u>‚Äúsignificant‚Äù implies an elevated contribution</u>, as the definition of the term includes ‚Äúconveying information about the value of quantity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. important, notable, consequential.‚Äù (<i>The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary</i>, <i>supra</i> at 2860); The Respondent respectfully disagrees with the analysis of Lambert J.A. in the Court of Appeal below .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the term significant can be equated with the term ‚Äúnot insignificant.‚Äù The term insignificant is defined as that which is ‚Äúof no importance; trivial; trifling; contemptible.‚Äù (<i>The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary</i>,<i> supra</i> at 1379). Something that is not trivial or not trifling is not necessarily something that is important.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">The difference between this test [of a ‚Äúsignificant contributing cause‚Äù] and the one of ‚Äúbeyond the de minimis range‚Äù is clearly seen when we place the discussion in the context of the tests for factual and blamable causation. First, the prosecution will have established factual causation if the triers of fact were satisfied that the proscribed result would not have occurred but for the defendant‚Äôs conduct. As noted earlier, this ‚Äúbut-for‚Äù test is made out if the defendant‚Äôs conduct was found to have been a more than trivial or negligible contribution of the result. Passing this initial test renders the defendant‚Äôs conduct a ‚Äúcontributing‚Äù cause to the result. The prosecution must then proceed to establish blamable causation by <u>persuading the triers of fact that the defendant‚Äôs conduct was not just a contributing cause but that it ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù contributed to the result</u>.

In my view, describing a contributing cause as having a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù impact attaches a greater degree of influence or importance to it than do the words ‚Äúnot insignificant‚Äù. As a recent editorial of the <i>Criminal Law Journal</i> observes: ‚ÄúSemantics, popular usage of words and expressions, and common sense all have their respective critical roles to play in the determination of causation in the criminal law‚Äù (‚ÄúSemantics and the threshold test for imputable causation‚Äù (2000), 24 <i>Crim.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Our law is a law of words. Although there are several major sources of law in the Anglo-American tradition, all consist of words. Morality or custom may be embedded in human behavior, but law -- virtually by definition -- comes into being through language. Thus, the legal profession focuses intensely on the words that constitute the law, whether in the form of statutes, regulations, or judicial opinions.</p>

The words we use provide a filter through which we view and acknowledge legal concepts (see G. A. Weissman, ‚ÄúLegal Esoterica: Reality is shaped by the language we use: ‚ÄòJack and the Beanstalk‚Äô as told by a judge, a psychiatrist, and an economist‚Äù (1986), 29 <i>Advocate</i> (Idaho) 22). It is therefore crucial to our analysis that we use exact language.&nbsp; For the introduction of his book <i>The Word of the Law</i> (1992)<span lang="EN-GB">, D. R. Klinck, a law professor at McGill University, finds inspiration in the teaching of Chinese philosopher Confucius: ‚ÄúWhen asked what he would do first if invited to administer a country, Confucius replied: ‚ÄòIt would certainly be to correct language‚Äô‚Äù (p. 8). Confucius added: ‚ÄúIf language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success‚Äù.</span>&nbsp; <span lang="EN-GB">In <i>Deeks v.

One would have thought it most natural for a literary man, writing a book for popular perusal, to clothe in his own language the historical facts taught him by his authorities rather than to use the terminology of the expert original. <u>Where we have a subject like law -- in which a statement is to be accepted because of the position of the person who makes it, his precise words may be and in many cases are of importance and should be given <i>verbatim</i></u>, but this is not the case where the statement is one of a fact.

I have found no legitimate reason to reformulate the <i>Smithers</i> test, rather it is my opinion that such alteration should be strenuously proscribed since it will elevate the threshold of causation.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The third element is that the accused must have caused the death.&nbsp; In connection with this element you must satisfy yourselves that the accused caused the death in two separate senses.&nbsp; First, are you satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of Mrs. Loski was caused by the acts of the accused Nette, by Mr. Quesnel, or both of them, rather than her death being caused by some other matter?</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In this connection I must tell you that the law provides that as long as some action of the accused or a joint action of the two accused pursuant to a common intention contributed to her death and was more than a trivial cause thereof, as long as some action of theirs contributed to her death and was more than a trivial cause thereof, he may be found, for purposes of murder and manslaughter, to have caused her death notwithstanding that there were other causes involved for which he was or may not have been responsible.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Thus, if there was evidence that Mrs. Loski had died from causes totally unconnected with the actions of the accused he would not have caused her death, but if his or their common actions were one of the causes of her death and were more than a trivial cause, you may find that he caused her death if you are satisfied of that beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

In the first case, <i>R. v. Cribbin</i> (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 548, the Court of Appeal held that the <i>Smithers</i> test was the appropriate standard to support a conviction of second degree murder and was essentially the same as the standard in England or Australia, although different terminology was used to express the standard.&nbsp; In the second case, <i>R. v. Meiler</i> (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 11, the Court of Appeal also concluded that the <i>Smithers</i> test was the proper test for second degree murder.</p>

Motor Vehicle Act</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 513; <i>R. v. Vaillancourt</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636,&nbsp; at p. 652-53; <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 336; <i>R. v. Creighton</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at p. 17; <i>Cribbin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 568.&nbsp; In determining whether legal causation is established, the inquiry is directed at the question of whether the accused person should be held criminally responsible for the consequences that occurred.&nbsp; The nature of the inquiry at the stage of determining legal causation is expressed by G. Williams as follows in his <i>Textbook of Criminal Law</i> (2nd ed. 1983), at pp. 381-82, quoted in <i>Cribbin</i>, at p. 568:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">When one has settled the question of but-for causation, the further test to be applied to the but-for cause in order to qualify it for legal recognition is not a test of causation but a moral reaction.&nbsp; The question is whether the result can fairly be said to be imputable to the defendant. . . .&nbsp; If the term ‚Äúcause‚Äù must be used, it can best be distinguished in this meaning as the ‚Äúimputable‚Äù or ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù or ‚Äúblamable‚Äù cause, to indicate the value-judgment involved.&nbsp; The word ‚Äúimputable‚Äù is here chosen as best representing the idea.&nbsp; Whereas the but-for cause can generally be demonstrated scientifically, no experiment can be devised to show that one of a number of concurring but-for causes is more substantial or important than another, or that one person who is involved in the causal chain is more blameworthy than another.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The issue before this Court was whether the trial judge had properly charged the jury with respect to s. 214(5).&nbsp; The appellant conceded that he was a party to the murder of the victim while participating in her forcible confinement or sexual assault, but he argued that the words ‚Äúcaused by that person‚Äù in s. 214(5) of the <i>Code</i> meant that he could only be found guilty of first degree murder if his actions in holding down the victim‚Äôs legs were the diagnostic cause of death.&nbsp; The medical evidence revealed that the diagnostic cause of death was asphyxia.&nbsp; Clearly the asphyxia was not directly caused by the holding of her legs but rather by the actions of the appellant‚Äôs accomplice in strangling her.&nbsp; The Crown argued that the words ‚Äúcaused by that person‚Äù in s. 214(5) did not create a causation requirement distinct from the causation required for murder generally.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
