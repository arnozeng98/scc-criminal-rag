The trial judge made a short address and, towards the end, told the jury that:&nbsp; "While matters of evidence are entirely up to you, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suggest if you accept the evidence of [the police officer] the Crown has a very powerful case.&nbsp; If you have a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence then the accused should be found not guilty.&nbsp; The matter is entirely up to you."&nbsp; The jury continued to deliberate for another hour before retiring.&nbsp; They reconvened the next day at 9&nbsp;a.m. and delivered a guilty verdict at 9:59&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction, holding that the jury was not prejudicially influenced by the trial judge's opinion on the strength of the Crown's case.&nbsp; This appeal is to determine whether a trial judge should give his opinion on matters of fact while exhorting a deadlocked jury to reach a verdict.</span></p>

(p. 418).&nbsp; The disagreement between the majority, <i>per</i> Gibbs J.A. and the dissent, <i>per</i> Lambert J.A., centered on the propriety and the potential effect of the trial judge's statement of opinion as to the strength of the Crown's case when exhorting the jury to reach a verdict.</span></p>

(p. 418).&nbsp; Gibbs J.A. found that the members of the jury "could never have been in any doubt, or under any misapprehension, about their duty or their critical role in the process" (p. 419).&nbsp; Gibbs J.A. also regarded the sequence of events following the exhortation as significant to the issue of whether the appellant had been prejudiced.&nbsp; Distinguishing <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 402 (B.C.C.A.), where a verdict was returned 15 minutes after an impugned exhortation, he concluded that the hour of deliberation, followed by some overnight thinking time, then followed by another hour of deliberation, negated concern that the jury might have been prejudicially influenced by the trial judge's opinion on the strength of the Crown's case. </span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 332, and R. E. Salhany, <i>Canadian Criminal Procedure</i> (5th ed. 1989), at pp. 291-92.&nbsp; This raises a threshold issue: is an exhortation to a deadlocked jury to be viewed as a continuation of the charge or do different considerations apply?</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

McKenna</i> (1960), 44 Cr. App. R. 63.&nbsp; The trial Judge equally must avoid the use of language which is likely to convey to a juror that, despite his own doubts, genuinely entertained, he is, none the less, entitled to give way and agree with the majority of his colleagues in the interest of achieving unanimity: see <i>R. v. Davey</i> (1960), 45 Cr. App. R. 11.</span></p>

Palmer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 412, Bull J.A. speaking for the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated the following:</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious, from their very nature and purpose, that all exhortations of unanimity to a jury are of a very delicate nature and the greatest care must be taken by a trial Judge to ensure that no such criticism, always lurking at the edge, can arise.&nbsp; It must be in very few cases that a trial Judge would intentionally try to influence a jury one way or the other, and there certainly could not be the slightest suggestion that in this case the learned trial Judge was doing anything else than endeavouring fairly and impartially to have the jury come to grips with the problems they had been sworn to decide.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, such exhortations, no matter how benevolent in tone and purpose, must be examined with the greatest of care to ensure that no prejudice to the accused has resulted therefrom.&nbsp; This may be particularly so where, as in this case, an exhortation to strive to reach a verdict given after many hours of apparent disagreement is followed very shortly by a guilty verdict.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jury system places a heavy responsibility in the hands of jury members.&nbsp; Individuals are asked to make grave decisions bearing upon the rights and liberties of their peers.&nbsp; It is a burden which may prey heavily on the minds of some.&nbsp; While deadlock may reflect dispassionate disagreement among jury members, on occasion it may also arise from an inability or unwillingness by the jury or its specific members to accept that the future of a fellow citizen lies in their hands.&nbsp; The trial judge's exhortation reminds the jury that their oath requires them to discharge the onerous responsibility which has been placed on them on behalf of society.&nbsp; If the judge expresses an opinion at this point, it may give troubled jury members an easy means of escape from their responsibilities.&nbsp; They may fasten onto the opinion of the trial judge and thereby reach a verdict without truly having deliberated and been convinced of the guilt of the accused.&nbsp; At this point, the trial judge must encourage such jurors to have faith in their own judgment.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I conclude that the dangers associated with a trial judge offering his or her opinion on issues of fact during an exhortation to a deadlocked jury are of such potential detriment to an accused's fair trial interest that judges as a general rule should refrain from offering such comments.&nbsp; An exception may arise in the case where the jury requests the judge's view or where it is apparent from the jury's questioning that the jury requires further clarification.&nbsp; Even then, the judge should be careful to offer the required opinion in a balanced and fair way which will not sway the process of decision-making in which the jury is involved to one side or the other.</span></p>

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">(2) <i>Application of the Rule to this Case</i></span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In exhorting the jury to reach a verdict, the trial judge offered his opinion that "if you accept the evidence of Sergeant Ross the Crown has a very powerful case."&nbsp; This constitutes a statement of opinion on the evidence, and a strong one.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is argued that the statement is conditional ("if you accept the evidence . . ."), and does not direct the jury to accept or reject the evidence.&nbsp; But this argument misses the point.&nbsp; The danger of the statement lies not in the effect it might have on the jury's acceptance or rejection of the evidence, but in the inference it invites the jury to draw from the evidence.&nbsp; The record discloses no serious issues of credibility; Sergeant Ross in cross-examination agreed with the accused's version of the statements he had made to the police.&nbsp; The problem lay, rather, in what inferences should be drawn from the statements.&nbsp; None of the statements alleged to have been made by the accused constituted a clear confession of guilt.&nbsp; For example, one could infer guilt from the statement about killing or being charged with killing a 71-year-old woman; or one could take it merely as an expression of concern over the charge.&nbsp; The choice of inference, not credibility, was the critical issue.&nbsp; In stating that if the jury accepted the evidence of the Sergeant, the Crown had a very powerful case, the trial judge was throwing his weight behind the inference of guilt.&nbsp; As Lambert J.A. put it, the trial judge was suggesting that unless the jury disbelieved Sergeant Ross, Sims was guilty.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is argued that taken in its context, the appellant's statements to Sergeant Ross in Toronto clearly indicated guilt, so that the trial judge's comment was justified.&nbsp; For the reasons I have just given, I cannot agree.&nbsp; </span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is argued that the trial judge's expression of opinion could not have created prejudice because of his repeated statements to the jury, including one connected to that very statement, that matters of evidence were entirely up to them.&nbsp; Such reminders do not negate the possibility that the communication of the judge's opinion might have lead the jury to decide a question of evidence one way as opposed to the other.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is argued that the fact that the jury deliberated almost two hours after the exhortation establishes that they were not influenced by the trial judge's comment.&nbsp; I concur with Lambert J.A.'s finding on this point (at p. 410):</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My view is that the time lapse from when the trial judge made his observation that the Crown had a very powerful case until the delivery of the jury's verdict was just about the amount of time that would have been required for the members of the jury who were in favour of a guilty verdict to emphasize to the member or members of the jury who were in favour of a not guilty verdict that the trial judge had expressed&nbsp; his view and that view was that unless they were prepared to say that they disbelieved Sergeant Ross then Sims was guilty.</span></p> 
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
