   <p class="Keywords">Criminal Law — Attempted murder — Mens rea — Whether requisite mens rea restricted to intent to kill or recklessly cause bodily harm known to likely cause death — Whether s. 24 in combination with construc­tive murder sections can form basis for attempted murder — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 24(1), 212 (a)(i),(ii), 213(d).</p> 
   <p class="SummaryCxSpFirst">Respondent, who wanted to speak with his estranged wife, broke into an apartment building with a loaded sawed-off shotgun. Kurely, the man with whom his wife had been living, went to investigate the sound of break­ing glass and threw the chair he was carrying at respondent when he saw him climbing the stairs. The gun discharged, missing Kurely, and a struggle followed. Shortly after his arrest, respondent stated to police that he "had him [Kurely] by the throat and I would have killed him." The trial judge found respondent had broken into the apartment building with the intent to use the shotgun to force his wife to leave and convicted him of attempted murder. The Court of Appeal over-turned that conviction and ordered a new trial. At issue here is whether the <i>mens rea </i>in attempted murder is limited to an intention to cause death or to cause bodily harm knowing it to be likely to cause death, or whether the <i>mens rea </i>required extended to the intention to do some action constituting murder as defined by ss. 212 or 213 of the <i>Code.</i></p>

   <p class="SummaryCxSpFirst"><i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Per </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson JJ.: The <i>mens rea </i>for attempted murder is the specific intent to kill and a mental state falling short of that level, while it might lead to convic­</span>tion for other offences, cannot lead to a conviction for an<span style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> attempt. The completed offence of murder involves kill­ing and any intention to complete that offence must include the intention to kill. An attempt to murder should have no lesser intent. Nothing illogical arises from the fact that in certain circumstances a lesser intent will suffice for a conviction for murder. A person cannot intend to commit the unintentional killings </span>described in ss. 212 and 213 of the<span style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="SummaryCxSpMiddle"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The crime of attempt developed as, and remains, an offence separate and distinct from murder.

   <p class="Para">I would therefore allow this appeal.</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">The judgment of Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIn­tyre, Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson JJ. was deliv­ered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">MCINTYRE </span>J.—This appeal involves consider­ation of the mental element required for proof of the crime of attempted murder, the subject of this Court's earlier judgment in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Lajoie v. The Queen, </span></i>[1974] S.C.R. 399.</p> 
   <p class="Para">At the date of the events which give rise to this appeal the respondent had been married some twenty-five years. His wife had left the matrimoni­al home and was living with one Kurely. The respondent was depressed and had been drinking to excess on the date in question. He telephoned his wife at Kurely's residence and told her he was afraid that their twenty-three year old son was about to commit suicide and asked her to meet him. She refused to cooperate. Later the same evening the respondent broke into a friend's home while its owners were absent and took away three shotguns. He sawed off the barrel of one, loaded it, and taking some extra ammunition with him went to Kurely's apartment building and gained entry by breaking the glass in the front door. On hearing the noise caused by the breaking glass, Kurely came from his bedroom to investigate, carrying a chair with a jacket hanging on it. He saw the respondent, carrying the shotgun, ascending the stairs to the second floor. He threw the chair and jacket, hitting the respondent. The gun went off. The blast missed Kurely by some three feet but put a hole in the jacket which had been on the chair. A struggle followed in which Kurely appears to have wrested the gun from the respondent. When the police arrived, having been called during</p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 228]</p> 
   <p class="Para">the course of the fight between the two men, Kurely was on the floor with his head partly under a bed and with the respondent upon him striking him weakly.</p> 
   <p class="Para">Shortly after his arrest the respondent stated to the police:</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">I just went over to see my wife. I had phoned her earlier.</span> I broke the window and went in. Then I heard what <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">sounded like a gun go off. You are lucky you got there</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">when you did. I had him by the throat and I would have</span> killed him.</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">According to the respondent's account of events, the gun was discharged accidentally, although under tests conducted by the police the weapon was not found to be prone to accidental discharge.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">The respondent was charged with a number of offences arising out of this affair but only one, that of attempted murder, is involved in this appeal. It was contained in the first count of the information and was in these terms:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">... did attempt to murder Michael KURELY by disc<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">harging a sawed-off shotgun at him contrary to s. 222</span> of the Criminal Code of Canada.</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">He elected trial by judge alone and was convicted. The conviction was quashed in the Court of Appeal and a new trial directed. This appeal is taken by leave of this Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">The trial judge disposed of the other charges against the respondent and made a finding that he had broken into Kurely's apartment building with intent to use the shotgun to force his wife to leave. He said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">I turn now to the very real point of the charge of attempted murder, and having made the finding I have of the break and enter at the house at 108 6th Street, <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">with intent to commit an indictable offence, wither [sic]</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">forceable confinement or worse. Forceable confinement</span> if you accept the evidence of the Accused, I feel prob­ably worse than that.</p> 
   <p class="Para">He then referred to s. 213(d) of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">Criminal </span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Code</span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt"></span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> </span></i>which is in these terms:</p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 229]</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">213. Culpable homicide is murder where a person <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">causes the death of a human being while committing or</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">attempting to commit ... kidnapping and forcible con</span>finement ... breaking and entering ... whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being, if</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon his person</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit the offence, or</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(ii) during or at the time of his flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence,</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">and the death ensues as a consequence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">Noting that breaking and entering with intent to commit an indictable offence is one of the offences named in the section, he convicted the respondent of attempted murder on the basis that the respond­ent had carried and used a weapon in the course of a breaking and entry with intent to effect forceable confinement of his wife.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">The judgment of the Court of Appeal (MacKin­non A.C.J.O., Dubin and Lacourcière JJ.A.) was written by MacKinnon A.C.J.O. He accepted the submission by counsel for Ancio that the findings of fact which formed the basis of the conviction were that the respondent committed the offence of breaking and entering Kurely's residence and that he had in his possession a weapon during the commission of the offence. He then considered whether these findings of fact in the absence of any finding of an intent to kill or cause bodily harm were sufficient to support a conviction for attempted murder by the interaction of ss. 24(1) and 213(d) of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal Code, </span></i>and said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">There is no question in the instant appeal that the trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to break and enter the Kurrelli <i><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">[sic] </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">premises and intended to have in his possession the</span> sawed-off shotgun. The appellant was charged with the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">offence of attempted murder and the "offence" referred</span> to in s. 24(1) is the offence of "attempted murder" and not the offence of break and enter while carrying a <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">weapon on his person.

At trial the judge instructed the jury that in order to convict the appellant upon the attempted murder charge they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that in shooting at the victim the accused had the intent to kill him. He declined to act on the Crown's request to charge the jury to the effect that, if they were not satisfied on the question of the intent to kill, a conviction of attempted murder could also rest upon proof of an intent to cause the appellant bodily harm, knowing it to be likely to cause death and being reckless whether death ensued or not.

   <p class="Page">[Page 233]</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">authorities which have dealt with this question concluded his reasons by saying, at p. 399:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">It was ably argued by Mr. Lecovin, counsel for the respondent, that the word "attempt" relates, in the first place, to an endeavour to commit a crime, and accord­ingly there cannot be an attempt unless the respondent was trying to commit the crime — in this case, to kill. <span lang="FR-CA">I cannot accept this submission. I do not go so far as to suggest that a trial judge must, in every case of attempted murder, charge on the indirect intent found in s. 201(a)(ii). In some special set of circumstances it may be inappropriate to charge on the indirect intent found in this subsection. (I do not find it necessary, in this case, to consider subss. (b) and (c) of s. 201.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">However, upon the facts in this case I have no doubt that the indirect intent described in s. 201(a)(ii) should have been drawn to the jury's attention in order that the jurymen could consider whether, in the circumstances, the accused meant to cause the victim bodily harm that he, the accused, knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Taggart J.A. dissented. He recognized that there was authority which would support the positions taken by both parties to the appeal, and he dealt with the leading cases and reached the conclusion that to obtain a conviction for attempted murder the Crown must prove that the accused intended to kill the victim.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In the Supreme Court of Canada the appeal was dismissed. Martland J. wrote the judgment of the Court and after a brief statement </span><span lang="FR-CA">of <span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">the facts stated the question in issue, at p. 401, in these words:</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">The question of law, which is in issue in this appeal, as a result of the dissent of Taggart J.A. in the Court of Appeal, is as to whether the learned trial judge should have directed the jury that the intent, which must be established to support a charge of attempted murder, is proven if the jury is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not. Branca J.A. and Nemetz J.A. were of the opinion that the learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury in this way. Taggart J.A. took the opposite view.</p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 234]</p> 
   <p class="Para">He recognized that there was conflicting authority upon the question, but he expressed agreement with the majority <i>of </i>the Court <i>of </i>Appeal and he said, at p. 405:</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">Section 210 of the Code provides that every one who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life. Murder may be committed if the accused means to cause death, but it may also be committed if he means to cause bodily harm knowing that it is likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not. If it can be established that the accused tried to cause bodily harm to another of a kind which he knew was likely to cause death, and that he was reckless as to whether or not death would ensue, then, under the wording of s. 210, if death did not ensue an attempt to commit murder has been proved.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para">He supported this conclusion by referring to the difference between s. 264 of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Criminal Code </span></i><i>of </i>1927, which was in these terms:</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">264. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life, who, with intent to commit murder,</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">(a) administers any poison or other destructive thing to any person, or causes any poison or destructive thing to be so administered or taken, or attempts to administer it, or attempts to cause it to be so administered or taken; or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">(b) by any means whatever wounds or causes any griev­ous bodily harm to any person; or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">(c) shoots at any person, or, by drawing a trigger or in any other manner, attempts to discharge at any person any kind of loaded arms; or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(d) attempts to drown, suffocate, or strangle any person; or</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(e) destroys or damages any building by the explosion of any explosive substance; or</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(f) sets fire to any ship or vessel or any part thereof, or any part of the tackle, apparel or furniture thereof, or to any goods or chattels being therein; or</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(g) casts away or destroys any vessel; or</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(f) by any other means attempts to commit murder. </p> 
   <p class="Para">and s. 210 <i>of </i>the 1953-54 <i>Code, </i>now s. 222:</p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 235]</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">210. Every one who attempts by any means to commit <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">murder is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to</span> imprisonment for life.</p> 
   <p class="Para">He observed that s. 264 of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">Criminal Code </span></i>in its opening sentence included the words "who, with intent to commit murder" and that these words were omitted and replaced with "who attempts … to commit murder" in the revision which resulted in the enactment of s. 210. <span lang="FR-CA">He concluded that it was the presence of the words "with intent to commit murder" in the former section 264 that led the court to conclude in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">R. v. Flannery, </span></i>[1923] 3 W.W.R. <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">97, </span></i>40 C.C.C. 263, that only a specific intent to kill would suffice to found a conviction for attempted murder and that it was that intent which was considered to be essential by Lord Goddard in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Whybrow </span></i>cited <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">infra. </span></i>In his view the omission of those words in the enactment of s. 210 justified a construction of s. 24 which would admit of a conviction for attempted murder without a specific intent to kill.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">He then referred to the decision of this Court in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">R. v. Trinneer, </span></i>[1970] <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">S.C.R. </span></i>638, which con­cerned the application of s. 21(2) of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Criminal Code </span></i>and which involved consideration of the words "the commission of the offence" as they appear in s. 21(2). The relevance of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Trinneer </span></i>case was explained on the basis that the Court had there decided that the words "the commission of the offence" meant commission in any of the ways contemplated by the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Code </span></i>and not merely its commission in the form of an intentional killing. He said, at p. 408:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">Similarly, in my opinion, when s. 24(1) refers to "an intent to commit an offence", in relation to murder it <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">means an intention to commit that offence in any of the</span> ways provided for in the Code whether under s. 201 (now 212) or under s. 202 (now 213).</p> 
   <p class="Para">There is no doubt that prior to this Court's judgment in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Lajoie </span></i>there was much uncertainty on this issue caused by the differing views expressed by the courts on the matter. In his dissenting reasons in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Lajoie </span></i>in the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Taggart J.A. illustrated this point by referring to many of the cases, including R. v.</p>

The Crown had argued that if the accused meant to cause bodily injury which he knew to be likely to cause death, and was reckless whether it did or not, the necessary intent for a conviction was present. This proposition was rejected and, at pp. <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">265-66, </span></i>Stuart J. said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">The contention was that the accused evidently did <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">intend to cause Mary Steele a bodily injury which was</span> known to him to be likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not, and that, there<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">fore, there was evidence of an intent to murder, the act</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">described in the section amounting to murder. </span><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">But the</span><span lang="FR-CA"> <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">fallacy of this reasoning is this, that it is simply because</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">the actual intent to kill may be absent that sub-sec. (b)</span> is thought necessary at all. If that intent exists then <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">clause (a) covers the case. Parliament evidently thought</span> that even though the actual intent to kill might not be shown, yet if the offender intends to cause and does cause an injury which be knows to be likely to cause <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">death and doesn't care whether it does or not</span> </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">and death </span></i><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">actually results, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">the offence should be treated as murder. But where death has not </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">in fact </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">resulted and <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">the charge is of an</span> </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">intention </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">to murder coupled with acts</span><span lang="FR-CA"> apparently done for the purpose of carrying out that <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">intention, i.e., of an "attempt" to murder, as is indicated</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">in the marginal words of the Cr. Code R.S.C. 1906, ch.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="FR-CA">[Page 237]</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">146, then we are of opinion that the actual intent to kill must be shown. In other words the accused is deprived of the benefit of an absence of actual intent to kill only where he has actually killed and has intended to do an injury which he knows is likely to kill and is reckless whether it does so or not. Where, luckily for him, the injured person does not die then we thought and so decided that the actual intent to kill must be shown. The obscurity or difficulty probably arises from the use in sec. 264 of the words "intent to commit murder" instead of the words "intent to cause death." The word "murder" being used, which, by virtue of sec. 259 covers a number of different sets of facts and is, therefore, pregnant with legal significance, one is in danger of being led to include in the meaning of the word as used in sec. 264 everything that is to be found in the defini­tion of murder given in all the clauses of sec. 259. But if this method of interpretation were followed then reading 259 and 264 together we would have the expression "with <i><span style="letter-spacing:.4pt">the intention to mean </span></i>to cause to a person (not killed in fact) an injury which, &amp;c."</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">This was obviously not intended by Parliament and I think the expression "with intention to commit murder" must refer to that simple ordinary type of murder which is covered by clause (a) of sec. 259, namely, where "the offender means to cause the death of the person killed."</p>

There were three separate judgments written but all supported the proposition that an intent to kill was a neces­sary element which must be shown by the Crown to procure a conviction for attempted murder. The position taken by the court on this point is summa­rized in the words of Hyde J., at p. 287:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">All murder involves homicide and there can be no <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">attempt to murder without an attempt to kill. Basically,</span> murder is committed when a person "means to cause death" and does so (s. 201). By para. (c) of s. 201 the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">intent to cause death is replaced by the commission of</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">an act, for an unlawful object, "that he knows or ought</span> to know is likely to cause death" so that when death <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">occurs the assailant</span> <span style="letter-spacing:.35pt">is </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">presumed to have intended it even</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">though he may have desired "to effect his object without</span> causing death or bodily harm to any human being".

Owens, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">[1970] 2 C.C.C. 38 (B.C.C.A.), supports the proposition that the specific intent to kill must be shown in attempted murder, as does the English case of <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">R. v. Loughlin, [1959] </span></i>Crim. L.R. 518 (C.C.A.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para">The opposing view to that expressed in the cases cited above finds expression in R. v. <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Walker </span></i>in the Quebec Court of Appeal, <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">R. v. Ritchie </span></i>in the Ontario Court of Appeal and, particularly, in <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">Lajoie </span></i>in this Court. In <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">R. v. Walker </span></i>the accused was charged with attempted murder. He had been the driver of the car in which his companions arrived at the scene of the crime and attempted to make their escape after the commission of the robbery. In the pursuit which followed one of the accused's companions fired several shots from the moving car and wounded one of the pursuing officers. The appellant Walker was charged with attempted murder. His guilt depended upon proof of a common unlawful purpose under s. 21(2) of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Criminal Code. </span></i>The trial judge directed the</p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 239]</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">jury that to convict they would have to find that the unlawful purpose which was shared by the accused was to shoot some person. The court held (Rinfret J.A. dissenting) that if the accused and his companions formed an intention in common to commit armed robbery and to drive away with the proceeds they were all guilty as parties to any offence, such as attempted murder committed by one of them, if he knew or should have known that it would be a probable consequence of carrying out the intention. It was therefore possible upon such a direction that a conviction for attempted murder could be recorded without a specific intent to kill. Rinfret J.A. in a dissenting opinion adopted the view expressed in <i>Ménard </i>and <i>Tousignant </i>and concluded that the appeal should have been allowed, because the specific intent to kill had not been demonstrated and accordingly a conviction for attempted murder could not be made.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In <i>R. v. Ritchie </i>the Ontario Court of Appeal (Schroeder, McGillivray and Evans JJ.A.) held that a conviction of attempted murder would prop­erly be made if the jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused meant to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not. Schroeder J.A., who wrote the judgment of the court, chose between the opposing lines of authority with these words, at p. 343:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">The trend in modern criminal law is towards the expansion of the concept of <i><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">mens rea </span></i>to include reckless­ness as well as intention, and that is clearly exemplified in ss. 201 and 202 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>It is not easy to discern the logic which underlies the view that the mental element required for an attempt is that of a direct intention to bring about the <i>actus reus </i>of the crime intended. I adopt the opinion expressed in R. v. <i>Walker, </i>cited <i>supra, </i>and R. v. <i>McLennan, </i>cited <i>supra, </i>in preference to the opinions expressed in the other cases which have been cited. I am free to do so since I am unaware of any Ontario decision in which the principle relied upon by appellant's counsel was adopted and applied.</p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 240]</p> 
   <p class="Para">A great deal of the confusion surrounding the nature of the intent required to found a conviction for attempted murder may well stem from an assumption that murder and attempted murder are related offences which must share the same mental elements. A brief review of the historical development of the law relating to the two offences demonstrates that the crime of attempt developed as a separate and distinct offence from the offence of murder.</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">In very early times murder was simply the kill­ing of a human being. The law was concerned with the injury done to the family of the deceased and the compensation which should follow. The conse­quence of the killing was the important feature and the intent or <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">mens rea </span></i>was of little if any significance. Special mental elements were recog­nized in statutes as early as the thirteenth century, and by the fourteenth century the concept of malice aforethought had developed (see 13 Rich­ard 2, Stat. 2, c. 1). Thus two elements came to be recognized in murder: the killing, and the malice aforethought, which in modern times has come to mean the necessary intent or intents.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">As the common law developed, the mental ele­ment required for the commission of murder expanded to include both constructive intent and knowledge of the likelihood of death as a result of a person's acts, with recklessness as to whether death ensued or not. Murder was thus defined in the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Criminal Code </span></i>when it was enacted in 1892 in ss. 227 and 228 in these words:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">227. Culpable homicide is murder </span><span lang="FR-CA">in </span><span lang="FR-CA">each of the following cases:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(a) If the offender means to cause the death of the person killed;</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(b) If the offender means to cause to the person killed <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be</span> likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(c) If the offender means to cause death or, being so <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">reckless as aforesaid, means to cause such bodily injury</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">as aforesaid to one person, and by accident or mistake</span> kills another person, though he does not mean to hurt the person killed;</p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 241]</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(d) If the offender, for any unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be likely to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired that his object should be effected without hurting any one.</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">228. Culpable homicide is also murder in each of the following cases, whether the offender means or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to ensue:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(a) If he means to inflict grievous bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the offences in this section mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury; or</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(b) If he administers any stupefying or overpowering thing for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from the effects thereof; or</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">(c) If he by any means wilfully stops the breath of any person for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from such stopping of the breath.</p> 
   <p class="Citation1">2. The following are the offences in this section referred to: —Treason and the other offences mentioned in Part IV. of this Act, piracy and offences deemed to be piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody, resisting lawful apprehension, murder, rape, forcible abduction, robbery, burglary, arson.</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In s. </span><i>228 </i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">as originally enacted there was no provi­sion equivalent to </span><i>s. </i>213(d) <i>of </i><span style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="Page">[Page 242]</p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">(ii) during or at the time of his flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">I would first observe that ss. 212 and 213 of the present <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Criminal Code </span></i>prescribe the various mental elements which, if accompanied by a kill­ing, may amount to murder. It is trite to say then that murder may be a killing with intent to kill and it may also be a killing with a variety of other intents which involve no intent to kill.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA">The offence of attempts developed much later than the offence of murder. In early times an attempt to commit an offence was not itself a crime. It was considered that in the absence of a guilty act intention alone was not punishable. The modern offence of attempting the commission of a crime is said to have its origins in the Court of Star Chamber. An early venture into this field is found in <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">The Case of Duels </span></i>(1615), 2 St. Tr. 1033, which involved proceedings against one William Priest for sending a written challenge to duel and one Richard Wright for carrying it and a stick that was to be the measure of the length of the weapons to be employed. It was asserted by Sir Francis Bacon, then Attorney General, at p. 1041, that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">For the Capacity of this Court, I take this to be a <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">ground infallible: that wheresoever an offence is capital,</span> or matter of felony, though it be not acted, there the combination or practice tending to that offence is pun­<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">ishable in this court as a high misdemeanor. So practice</span> to impoison, though it took no effect; waylaying to <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">murder, though it took no effect; and the like; have been</span> adjudged heinous misdemeanors punishable in this court. Nay, inceptions and preparations in inferior <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">crimes, that are not capital, as suborning and preparing</span> <span style="letter-spacing:
-.2pt">of witnesses that were never deposed, or deposed nothing</span> material, have likewise been censured in this court, as appeareth by the decree in Garnon's Case.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="FR-CA">[Page 243]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The court in its decree gave effect to the Attorney General's submission saying, in part, at p. 1046:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">And the court with one consent did declare their opin­<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">ions: That by the ancient law of the land, all inceptions,</span> preparations, and combinations to execute unlawful acts, though they never be performed, as they be not to <span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">be punished capitally, except it be in case of treason, and</span> some other particular cases of statute law, so yet they <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">are punishable as misdemeanors and contemps: and that</span> this court was proper for offences of such nature.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The practice of the Court </span><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.8pt">of </span><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Star Chamber in this respect became firmly established in that court (see Hall, </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">General Principles of Criminal Law </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:

It has been said that the origin of the doctrine of crimi­nal attempt as it </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">is </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">known in the common law was Lord Mansfield's judgment in </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">R. v. Scofield </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">(1784), Cald. Mag. Rep. 397. Scofield was charged in an indictment </span><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.8pt">with </span><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">"wickedly, unlaw­fully and maliciously intending devising and con­triving to feloniously set fire to, burn and consume a certain house". Lord Mansfield said, at p. 402-03:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">The next question is, Whether an act done in pursu­ance of an intent to commit an act, which, if compleat­ed, would be a misdemeanor only, can itself be a misdemeanor? <span lang="FR-CA">It was objected, that an attempt to commit a misdeameanor was no offence: but no authority for this is cited; and there are many on the other side: as the case cited; of The </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">King v. Johnson, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">the </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">King v. Sutton, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">which was an indictment for having in custody and possession stamps </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">with intent </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">to impress septres on sixpences, etc. And there the court say "lading wool is lawful, but, if it be with </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">an intent </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">to transport it, that makes it an offence. Here the intent is the offence; and the having in his custody, an act that is the evidence of that intent." But in the case of the wool, the transport­<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">ing of it was only a misdemeanor, yet an act done to that</span> end was held indictable. In the </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">King v. Taylor, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">the Court granted an information as for a nuisance for keeping great quantities of gunpowder to the endanger­<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">ing of the church and houses where the defendant lived.</span> There is also the case cited of the </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">King v. Samuel Vaughan, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA">which is founded upon the same principle as that of the </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">King v.

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">corporation elections is an offence, for which an infor­<span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">mation will lie: the case of</span> <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Vaughan </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:

Langley </span></i>that words directly tending to a breach of the peace, are indictable.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1">There was a distinction made at the bar between an act done with an intent to commit a felony and an act done with an intent to commit a misdemeanor. In the <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">degrees of guilt there is great difference in the eye</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">of </span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">the</span> <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">law, but not in the description</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">of </span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">the offence. So long as</span> <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">an act rests in bare intention, it is not punishable by our</span> laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and, if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes criminal and punishable. The case cited of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:

   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">2. The question whether an act done or omitted with intent to commit an offence is or is not only preparation for the commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit it, is a question of law.</span></p>

   <p class="Citation1">Since the mischief contained in an attempt depends upon the nature of the crime intended, the criminality lies much more in the intention than in the acts done.</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">This proposition was accepted by Lord Goddard in </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">Whybrow, supra, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">at p. 147, where he stated that "the intent becomes the principal ingredient of the crime".</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The common law recognition of the fundamen­tal importance of intent in the crime of attempt is carried forward into the </span><i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal Code. </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">A reading of s. 24 of the </span><i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Code </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">and all its predecessors since the enactment of the first </span><i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Code </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">in 1892 confirms that the intent to commit the desired offence is a basic element of the offence of attempt. Indeed, because the crime of attempt may be complete without the actual commission of any other offence and even without the performance of any act unlawful in itself, it is abundantly clear that</span></p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 248]</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">the criminal element of the offence of attempt may lie solely in the intent. As noted by Glanville Williams, </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Criminal </span></i><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Law; The General </span></i><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Part </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(2nd ed., 1961), part 207, p. 642, in discussing attempts:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">An</span> <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">actus reus ... </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:
-.05pt">need not be a crime apart from the</span> state of mind. <span lang="FR-CA">It need not even be a tort or a moral wrong, or a social mischief.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The question now arises: What is the intent required for an attempt to commit murder? As has been indicated earlier, the Crown's position is that the intent required for a conviction on a charge of attempt to murder is the intent to do that which will, if death is caused, constitute the commission of murder as defined in ss. 212 and 213 of the </span><i>Code, so </i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">that a combination of ss. 24 and 213(d) can form the basis for a conviction of attempted murder. The respondent, on the other hand, argues that although the authorities presently limit the intent to that which would constitute murder as defined in s. 212 of the </span><i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Code, </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">logic and principle dictate that the intent should be limited to the specific intent to kill described in s. 212(a)(i).</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">While it is clear from ss. 212 and 213 of the </span><i><span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Criminal </span></i><i>Code</i><i></i><i> </i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">that an unintentional killing can be murder, it is equally clear that whatever mental elements may be involved and whatever means may be employed there cannot be a murder without a killing. </span><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Section 24 of the </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">Code </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">defines, in part, the offence of attempt as "having an intent to commit an offence". As Estey J. observed in R. v. </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Quinton, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">[1947] S.C.R. 234, at pp. 235-36, in referring to the then s. 72 (now s. 24):</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="FR-CA">This section requires that one to be guilty of an attempt<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> must intend to commit the completed offence and to </span>have done some act toward the accomplishment of that<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> objective.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The completed offence of murder involves a kill­ing. The intention to commit the complete offence</span></p> 
   <p class="Page">[Page 249]</p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">of murder must therefore include an intention to kill. I find it impossible to conclude that a person may intend to commit the unintentional killings described in ss. 212 and 213 of the <i>Code. </i>I am then of the view that the <i>mens rea </i>for an attempted murder cannot be less than the specific intent to kill.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">As I have said earlier, there is a division of opinion upon this point and strong arguments have been raised in favour of the Crown's position that a "lesser intent", such as that provided in s. 212(a)(ii) or even no intent at all relating to the causing of death as provided in s. <i>213</i><i></i><i>(d), </i>may suffice to found a conviction for attempted murder. This view is supported in </span><i><span lang="FR-CA">Lajoie. </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In my view, with the utmost respect for those who differ, the sections of the <i>Criminal Code </i>relied on in that case do not support that position.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">As noted above, Martland J.'s analysis of the intent required to found a conviction for attempted murder is based primarily on the change in word­ing of s. <i>222. </i>In my opinion, emphasis on the amendment of this section is unwarranted for two reasons. Firstly, s. <i>222 </i>does not define or create the offence of attempted murder. The scheme of the <i>Criminal Code </i>in relation to attempts has been the same from its inception. One section defines the offence of attempts generally (s. <i>72</i><i></i><i>, </i>now s. 24). Another sets out the penalties for attempts (s. 57, now s. 421), and a third creates a separate penalty for attempted murder (s. <i>264</i><i></i><i>, s. 210 </i>in <i>Lajoie, </i>now s. <i>222</i><i></i><i>). </i>Rather than defining or creat­ing an offence, s. <i>222</i><i></i><i> </i>merely fixes a penalty for a specific attempt. Despite the categorization of the various means of committing murder set out in the old s. <i>264</i><i></i><i>, </i>there is no essential difference between the old and the new sections in this respect.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Secondly, the elimination of the words "with intent to commit murder" from s. <i>264 is </i>not</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="FR-CA">[Page 250]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">significant, Section 24 defines an attempt as "hav­ing an intent to commit an offence". Because s. 24 is a general section it is necessary to `read in' the offence in question. The offence of attempted murder then is defined as "having an intent to commit murder". This does not differ from the old s. 264 reference to "with intent to commit murder", which Martland J. acknowledged was inter­preted, in </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:
1.2pt">R.</span></i><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.8pt"> v. Flannery, </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">to require the specific intent to kill.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Martland J. placed further emphasis on s. 222 of the </span><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt"><i>Criminal </i></span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.8pt">Code</span></i><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.8pt"></span></i><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.8pt"> </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">by relying on the words "attempts by any means" to support his conclusion that murder may be attempted in any of the "ways" set out in ss. 212 and 213. In my view, the reference to "any means" in s. 222 refers to ways in which a murder could be accomplished, such as by poisoning, shooting, or stabbing. The earlier version of s. 222 (s. 232 in 1892, s. 264 in 1906) listed the various methods by which a killing could be effected, but the illustrations were replaced in the 1953-54 revision with a general reference to murder "by any means". In any event, ss. 212 and 213 have nothing to do with the means of killing. They are concerned solely with describing the mental elements which will suffice to make a completed killing murder. The fact that certain mental elements, other than an intent to kill, may lead to a conviction for murder where there has been a killing does not mean that anything less than an intent to kill will suffice for an attempt at murder.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">It was argued, and it has been suggested in some of the cases and academic writings on the question, that it is illogical to insist upon a higher degree of </span><i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.8pt">mens rea </span></i><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">for attempted murder, while accepting a lower degree amounting to recklessness for murder. I see no merit in this argument. The intent to kill is the highest intent in murder and</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="FR-CA">[Page 251]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">there is no reason in logic why an attempt to murder, aimed at the completion of the full crime of murder, should have any lesser intent. If there is any illogic in this matter, it is in the statutory characterization of unintentional killing as murder. The <i>mens rea </i>for attempted murder is, in my view, the specific intent to kill. A mental state falling short of that level may well lead to convic­tion for other offences, for example, one or other of the various aggravated assaults, but not to a conviction for an attempt at murder. For these reasons, it is my view that <i>Lajoie </i>should no longer be followed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="FR-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">I would accordingly dismiss the Crown's appeal and confirm the Court of Appeal's order for a new trial.</span></p>
