24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">This case does not require an assessment of the overall strength of the Crown‚Äôs case at trial.&nbsp; When asked to declare a&nbsp; mistrial, the trial judge was essentially asked whether it was likely that the exposure by the jury to the tainted transcripts could have affected the jury to the point that the entire trial was compromised and that no remedy other than a new trial was available.&nbsp; Read in full, the offending passage in the transcripts handed to the jury refers to several matters that were not in evidence&nbsp; when the argument took place in the absence of the jury.&nbsp; A fair assessment of the impact that the transcript could have had on the jury must be made on the assumption that the jury read the transcript and understood that counsel for the accused was concerned that the jury should not find out that his client had made statements that the court had ruled inadmissible.&nbsp; This is how the trial judge approached the issue, and that is why she cautioned the jury as she did.&nbsp; She did not identify specifically the impugned passages, so as not to aggravate the damage, if any, but she clearly instructed the jury to disregard any references to matters that were not properly in evidence before them.&nbsp; The trial judge was obviously concerned with the effect and consequences&nbsp; of what had transpired and she took seriously the application for a mistrial.&nbsp; However, she made no error when she exercised her discretion to deny the motion for a mistrial, nor did she err in declining to enter a mistrial after the jury had returned its verdict.&nbsp; The trial judge was in a privileged position to assess the possible impact of the mishap on the jury, and the effectiveness of the sharp warning that she issued.&nbsp; There is no basis upon which it could be said that she was wrong in that judgment call. &nbsp;The information before the jury was at most an innuendo.&nbsp; Taking the case at its highest from the accused‚Äôs point of view, the admonition issued by the trial judge to the jury was sufficient to remedy any ill effect that the unedited transcripts might have had on the jury.&nbsp; As the trial judge did not err in rejecting the motion for a mistrial, there is no need to turn to the proviso.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> LeBel J.:&nbsp; The question before this Court is whether the conviction should be reversed because either an ‚Äúerror of law‚Äù or a ‚Äúmiscarriage of justice‚Äù has occurred and, if so, whether the curative proviso should be applied.&nbsp; In order for a verdict to be reversed under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) of the <i>Code</i>, it is not sufficient to demonstrate that a legal mistake has occurred.&nbsp; The judgment must have been based or possibly based on that mistake, so as to prejudice the accused.&nbsp; The other situations that may justify the intervention of a court of appeal fall into a residual category.&nbsp; Section&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) refers to miscarriages of justice, which cover irregularities other than the errors of law mentioned in s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) and which may have rendered the trial unfair or created the appearance of unfairness for the accused.&nbsp; Although ss.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) and 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) are distinct, they are nevertheless closely related.&nbsp; Both involve situations where an irregularity has occurred during the course of the trial.&nbsp; Whether the defect at trial appears to have been an error of law or an irregularity falling within the residual category of&nbsp; miscarriage of justice, the circumstances must be considered to see if the error was merely peripheral or could have played a significant role in the legal validity of the verdict or rendered the trial unfair, in reality or in appearance.&nbsp; If the error of law could not have prejudiced the accused, the conviction will be upheld.&nbsp; Reaching a conclusion in that respect will require a balancing taking into account the circumstances of the case and, more particularly, the nature and impact of the error of law.&nbsp; In that regard, the analysis under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) may call upon similar considerations as under s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii).</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The second stage of the analysis is the applicability of the curative proviso. In order to invoke s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) successfully, the Crown must demonstrate that any reasonable judge or jury would have rendered the same verdict.&nbsp; Even though an important error of law could have influenced the decision, it would not be appropriate to reverse the conviction when the evidence is so overwhelming against the accused that it would inevitably lead to the same result.&nbsp; Similarly, when the court of appeal finds that the evidence against the accused would inevitably have led to the same result, it can uphold a conviction despite having found that a procedural irregularity not amounting to a miscarriage of justice had occurred.&nbsp; Regardless of whether the proviso is used to cure an error of law or a procedural irregularity not amounting to a miscarriage of justice, it may be used only when the conviction was inevitable.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The leak of the tainted transcript to the jury was certainly an error or an irregularity.&nbsp; This mistake does not seem to be in the nature of an error of law.&nbsp; The judge did not make a decision on a question of law that was among the bases of a conviction.&nbsp; The error was more akin to a procedural irregularity that happened by accident.&nbsp; Thus, as this case does not seem to fall squarely within the error of law category, this becomes a matter to be examined under the residual category of procedural irregularity.&nbsp; The irregularity did not amount to a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; First, it did not relate to a point that was particularly central in law or in fact to the case against the accused.&nbsp; Second, the irregularity was not of significant importance.&nbsp; The fact that the trial was held before a judge and jury militates in favour of a finding of unfairness.&nbsp; However, all doubts concerning the unfairness or appearance of unfairness of the trial are put to rest when the remedy chosen by the judge when she realized that the tainted transcripts had been leaked to the jury is considered.</span></p>

Cloutier</i> (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont.&nbsp;C.A.), and adopted by Gonthier J. in <i>R. v. Bain</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91 (in dissent, with Iacobucci J. and McLachlin J., as she then was, concurring).&nbsp; In <i>Cloutier</i>, Goodman J.A. reviewed the legislative history of the provision and noted that it was first initiated in the House of Commons on February 7, 1984, to be eventually enacted and proclaimed into force on December 4, 1985.&nbsp; The section was first introduced in the House seven days after a January 31, 1984 judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Fenton</i> (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 109, which deplored the unavailability of curative provisions in the <i>Code</i> in the case of jurisdictional errors such as those caused by the accused having been even inadvertently excluded from small and sometimes uneventful portions of his trial.</p>

The real focus of the enactment of s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv) in 1985 seems to have been to put an end to the jurisprudence holding that&nbsp; procedural errors having caused a loss of jurisdiction in the trial courts could not be cured, even on appeal.</p>

Indeed, prior to the enactment of that provision, jurisdiction could be lost by remands for more than eight days without the accused‚Äôs consent.&nbsp; Yet this Court in <i>Krannenburg</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 1056, held that the new section still could not cure a ‚Äú[l]oss of jurisdiction over the offence‚Äù.&nbsp; In 1985, in the same Bill enacting s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iv), s. 440.1 was further amended to its present form.&nbsp; The parallels between <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec686subsec1" target="_blank">s. 686(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>b</i>)(iv) and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec485" target="_blank">s. 485<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> were highlighted by Macfarlane J.A. in <i>R. v.

The Queen</i>,<b> </b>[1985] 2 S.C.R. 233).&nbsp; If an accused were to complain on appeal of having been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, when the issue had not been raised at trial and therefore the trial judge had made no ruling on it, it could be said that no error of law is alleged, but that the appeal should be allowed on the ground that there was a miscarriage of justice (<i>R. v. B. (L.C.)</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Silvini</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 251 (Ont.

(3d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)), the ground of appeal would be based on s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii).&nbsp; In such cases, a finding of miscarriage of justice under s. 686(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) cannot in my view be cured under any of the remedial provisions contained in s. 686(1)(<i>b</i>) and the appeal must be allowed.</p>

In such a case, further use of the proviso is obviously precluded and the appeal must be allowed.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">On the one hand, appellate courts will maintain a conviction in spite of the errors of law where such errors were either minor in themselves or had no effect on the verdict and caused no prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; This accords with the original purpose of the section, as described early on by Taschereau J., writing for the majority of this Court, in <i>Chibok v.

Jolivet</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, 2000 SCC 29; <i>R. v. Stone</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290; <i>R. v. M√©nard</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 109;<i> R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314; <i>R. v.

Wong</i> (1992), 12 B.C.A.C. 211).&nbsp; In all&nbsp; those cases, the appellate courts were convinced that the error could have had no effect on the verdict.&nbsp; Because of the nature of the errors and of the issues with respect to which they were made, it was possible to trace their effect on the verdict and ensure that they made no difference.&nbsp; Generally, the errors concerned evidence that was insignificant to the determination of guilt or innocence (<i>Gunn</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Wong</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>United Nurses</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Klatt</i>, <i>supra</i>) or benefited the accused by imposing a more onerous standard on the Crown (<i>MacGillivray</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Haughton</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; Errors in the charge to the jury respecting a very minor aspect of the case that could not have had any effect on the outcome or concerning issues that the jury was otherwise necessarily aware of were also cured by the application of the proviso (<i>Jacquard</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Jolivet</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>M√©nard</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Chibok</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; Similarly, in some cases the errors concerned preliminary findings that would nevertheless, as a matter of law, inevitably have resulted in the same finding made by the trial judge (<i>Rockey</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Stone</i>, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Therefore, it is possible to apply the curative proviso even in cases where errors are not minor and cannot be said to have had only a minor effect on the trial, but only if it is clear that the evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused is so overwhelming that any other verdict but a conviction would be impossible (see <i>R. v.

Such an approach would, in my opinion, be totally unfounded. The jury asked for some materials, and it received them. They had the transcripts for several hours. It would be bizarre in my view to assume that having asked for the transcripts, they did not read them. Moreover, the part that should not have been given to them stood out in the transcript with the heading: ‚ÄúJURY OUT AT 11:38 A.M.‚Äù&nbsp; That might have attracted their attention.&nbsp; In any event, as a matter of law, I cannot see how speculation helps either way.&nbsp; We must assume that there was at least a real possibility that the jury was exposed to these materials and at this stage we cannot probe further as to the consequences.&nbsp; The appellant is entitled to advance his case on the basis of the real possibility of the worst case scenario.</p>

I would not go as far as suggesting, as counsel for the appellant does, that the passage inevitably implies that the appellant made a confession which was excluded. Read in full, the passage refers to several matters that were not in evidence&nbsp; when the argument took place in the absence of the jury.&nbsp; In my view, a fair assessment of the impact that the transcript could have had on the jury must be made on the assumption that they read it and understood that counsel for the appellant was concerned that the jury should not find out that his client had made statements that the court had ruled inadmissible; no more, no less.</p>

I share that concern.&nbsp; However, in my view, she made no error when she exercised her discretion to deny the motion for a mistrial, nor did she err in declining to enter a mistrial after the jury had returned its verdict.&nbsp; The trial judge was in a privileged position to assess the possible impact of the mishap on the jury and the effectiveness of the sharp warning that she issued.&nbsp; There is no basis upon which I could say that she was wrong in that fine judgment call.&nbsp; The information before the jury was at most an innuendo. At the very end of a murder trial, the jury would have come to appreciate the existence of rules of evidence that govern the relevant materials upon which they are called to make a decision.&nbsp; Taking the case at its highest from the appellant‚Äôs point of view, I believe that the admonition issued by the trial judge to the jury was sufficient to remedy any ill effect that the unedited transcripts might have had on the jury.</p>

This is especially true considering that some irregularities can have a psychological effect, which we presume judges are more apt to overcome than juries.&nbsp; However, this question is not absolutely determinative, and some irregularities will render the trial unfair even if they occurred before a judge sitting alone, while other mistakes may not be fatal even if they took place before a jury.&nbsp; Thus, a well-instructed jury may have the capacity to overcome irregularities.</p>

The decision of whether or not to declare a mistrial falls within the discretion of the judge, who must assess whether there is a real danger that trial fairness has been compromised (see <i>Emkeit</i>,<i> supra</i>, at pp. 139-40; <i>R. v.

This line of thinking could seriously undermine the entire jury system. The very strength of the jury is that the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence is determined by a group of ordinary citizens who are not legal specialists and who bring to the legal process a healthy measure of common sense. The jury is, of course, bound to follow the law as it is explained by the trial judge. Jury directions are often long and difficult, but the experience of trial judges is that juries do perform their duty according to the law.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;</p>

The ramifications of any such statement could be enormous. Moreover, the fundamental <u>right</u> to a jury trial has recently been underscored by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">s. 11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">f<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">[<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] The trial judge is the person, much more so than the Court of Appeal judges several years later, in the best position to assess its true, concrete and practical impact on the jury, in light of the general atmosphere in which the trial took place, the specific circumstances of the case, of what he may have observed during all the stages of the trial and the reaction of the members of the jury at the time of his comments on the incident.&nbsp; He is also in the best position to find a solution which would neutralize the poison distilled in the minds of the jury.&nbsp; His decision must therefore be given the greatest respect and it is only where the evidence shows that he was clearly mistaken and that he did not properly exercise his discretion that, in my view, a Court of Appeal can and must intervene.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 622, at p. 631; <i>Lewis v.

The inference drawn from counsel‚Äôs failure to object may be even stronger when he expressly gave his consent to the alleged irregularity.&nbsp; Finally, the more counsel had time to reflect to bring an objection, the more this criterion will be determinative, and the more it will be appropriate to infer that the trial was not unfair (see <i>R</i>. <i>v</i>. <i>Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at p. 1306).&nbsp;</p>

(<i>b</i>)(iv) does not appear only as a late reaction to the <i>Meunier</i> judgment, but was also intended to cover situations like the one which arose in <i>Fanjoy</i>,<i> supra</i>.<i> </i>&nbsp;It is designed to address situations where even serious procedural errors may be cured, provided it can be shown that they did not cause prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; Case comments seem to indicate that the provision may find its application in cases of substantial procedural error, where the error may or may not cause a loss of jurisdiction but causes no prejudice.&nbsp; (See E.

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">The question to be asked in determining whether there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice as a result of a trial judge's error is whether ‚Äúthe verdict would <u>necessarily</u> have been the same if such error had not occurred‚Äù: see <i>Colpitts</i> <i>v.</i> <i>The Queen</i>, [1965] S.C.R. 739, <i>per</i> Cartwright J. (as he then was), at p. 744; <i>Wildman v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 328‚Äë29. This test has also been expressed in terms of whether there is <u>any possibility</u> that if the error had not been committed, a judge or properly instructed jury would have acquitted the accused: see <i>Colpitts</i>, <i>per</i> Spence J., at p. 756; <i>R</i>. <i>v</i>. <i>S.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">Members of the jury, it's come to my attention that among some of the transcripts that you were provided with today that they contain some matters that took place while you were not in the courtroom and they are matters that were not properly put before you in evidence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">As I indicated to you in my charge to you, the only things that you are to base your decision on are the exhibits and the evidence that you heard from the witness box when you were here and on no other considerations.&nbsp; I can't strongly caution you enough that your decision is to be based solely on what was put before you through the witnesses and through the evidence that was filed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:78.45pt;line-height:
12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:12.2pt">What I have done is I have taken the transcripts that were provided to you.&nbsp; We're in the process of preparing proper transcripts and those will be given back to you when they're ready.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The next day, she warned them again in the following terms:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">We‚Äôre now in a position to give you clean copies of all of the transcripts.&nbsp; And before I do so, I again wish to urge you to remember the oath you took to render a true verdict based only on the evidence that was before you. &nbsp;I'm not certain whether you read anything that was in the transcripts that wasn't before you properly, but if you did, please put it out of your mind and look deep into yourself and make sure that you render a verdict based only on what was properly before you, that is the witness testimony and the exhibits that were filed in this case.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Finally, the final charge to the jury contained the following remarks:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">You will recall that during the course of my preliminary remarks to you at the commencement of these proceedings, I advised you that you are the sole judges of the facts in this case.&nbsp; You were sworn to bring in a true verdict according to the evidence.&nbsp; That means that you should only consider the testimony and the exhibits which have come before you at this trial.&nbsp; You must put out of your minds all prejudice against the accused and all sympathy for the deceased, which you may have, or anything which you may have heard or read or seen apart from the actual evidence that was given by the witnesses under oath in the witness box, exhibits admitted as evidence and admissions of facts made by counsel.</p>

Given the possibility that the jurors might not have read them, telling them which extracts she was referring to would most likely have done more harm than good.&nbsp; Thus, it was appropriate not to tell them more than needed about the contents of these extracts.&nbsp; If one of the jurors ever read the problematic passages, then the carefully worded warnings given by the trial judge were sufficient to ensure that no prejudice was caused to the appellant and that the trial did not appear unfair.&nbsp;</p>
