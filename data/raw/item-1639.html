24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The accused was charged with second degree murder and the sole issue at his trial was whether he was the person who had killed the victim. The case against the accused was largely circumstantial, and included evidence that he made false statements to the police after the murder, that he tried to dispose of the victim’s blood‑stained car and his own blood‑stained clothing, and that he attempted to flee from the area where he had concealed those items of evidence.&nbsp; The accused testified that he had acted solely out of fear that he would be linked to stolen property; he denied any involvement in the murder. The trial judge gave his instructions in segments throughout the trial and provided the jury with written transcripts of the various portions of his charge as he delivered them. The accused was convicted and the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. This appeal raised two main issues:&nbsp; (1) whether the trial judge should have instructed the jury not to draw any inference of guilt from the accused’s post‑offence conduct unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct was motivated by the accused’s consciousness of guilt for having murdered the victim, rather than by some other cause; and (2) whether the trial judge committed reversible error by delivering his instructions to the jury, both orally and in writing, in several segments throughout the trial rather than at the conclusion of the evidence and arguments. </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies only to the jury’s final evaluation of guilt or innocence and is not to be applied piecemeal to individual items or categories of evidence.&nbsp; There is no principled reason to create an exception to this rule for evidence of post‑offence conduct, particularly where such evidence is subject to competing interpretations and is not, in itself, crucial to the determination of the ultimate issue. In this regard, the trial judge’s charge complied with the applicable principles.&nbsp; Had the trial judge directed the jury at the outset to subject the evidence of post‑offence conduct to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, he would have been in error. </span></p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The format of a charge is a matter of discretion.&nbsp; What is crucial is that, at the conclusion of the charge, the jurors understand the nature of their task and have the necessary help from the instructions to carry it out. While the innovations undertaken by the trial judge were designed to improve the overall clarity of his instructions, certain aspects of the charge raise serious concerns.&nbsp; The distribution of transcripts, though not erroneous in itself, can easily give rise to reversible error in the event the jury receives only part of the trial judge’s instructions in written form.&nbsp; Any trial judge adopting such an approach must take care to ensure that the entire charge is provided to the jury in a clear and legible form, and that all the jurors are capable of reading the materials.&nbsp; Likewise, instructing the jury in segments throughout the trial does not necessarily constitute error but it does increase the risk that the jury might be confused by erroneous statements of law at the outset of the trial or by instructions which are not ultimately related to any of the evidence introduced in the case. When the jury charge is delivered piecemeal over the course of the trial, corrections of any errors the trial judge may previously have made become markedly more difficult.&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge erred in his preliminary instructions regarding the substantive law of murder, but this error did not merit a reversal of the accused’s conviction since the question of murder was not a live issue in the trial.&nbsp;In addition, the second segment of the charge was overinclusive, since it addressed the use of prior inconsistent statements of an accused, even though it was not yet known whether the accused would testify, let alone whether he would be confronted with prior statements.&nbsp; The trial judge corrected this problem in his closing address by directing the jury to disregard his earlier comments on prior inconsistent statement by an accused. As a last remark, even if it is assumed that the jury followed the trial judge’s instructions and reread their written transcripts concerning the fundamental principles of reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof, it would have been better for the trial judge to repeat that portion of his instructions and thereby ensure that he was sending the jury into deliberations with those principles fresh in their minds.&nbsp; In spite of these criticisms, the charge taken in its entirety in the circumstances of this case did not result in any miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

White</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, which is being released simultaneously with the decision in this appeal.&nbsp; The second issue concerns the format of the trial judge’s charge to the jury.&nbsp; The appellant submits that the trial judge committed reversible error by delivering his instructions to the jury, both orally and in writing, in several segments throughout the trial rather than at the conclusion of the evidence and arguments.</p>

(3d) 424 (Arbour, Labrosse and Weiler JJ.A.).&nbsp; The appeal rested on several grounds.&nbsp; With regard to the format of the jury charge, Ménard contended that the trial judge erred by giving his instructions in segments throughout the trial and by providing written transcripts of the various portions of his charge as he delivered them.&nbsp; Arbour J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal, criticized those practices but found that they did not give rise to reversible error.&nbsp; Specifically, she held that while the distribution of transcripts could have been fatal had the trial judge provided only an incomplete written portion of his charge, in this case the jury received all of the instructions in writing.&nbsp; With respect to the splitting of the jury charge over the course of the trial, the Court of Appeal recognized a more serious danger, namely, that an error of law made in an early portion of the charge might never be adequately corrected later.&nbsp; Arbour J.A. noted that the trial judge did in fact make an error of law in the early portion of his charge, in his discussion of the definition of murder.&nbsp; However, it concluded at p. 432:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">. . .&nbsp; the error was harmless since there was never a live issue that a murder was committed.&nbsp; The case was a simple one.&nbsp; The only issue for the jury to determine was whether the appellant was the person who murdered the deceased.</p>

Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.&nbsp; <i>White</i> also provides that there is no principled reason to create an exception to the rule in <i>Morin</i> for evidence of post-offence conduct, particularly where such evidence is subject to competing interpretations and is not, in itself, crucial to the determination of the ultimate issue.&nbsp; This Court concluded in <i>White</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 56-57:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Much of the confusion in this area of the law stems from the practice of categorizing evidence of flight or concealment in terms of the conclusion which the Crown seeks to draw from it, namely that it establishes the “consciousness of guilt” of the accused.&nbsp; That inference, going as it does so directly to the ultimate issue of guilt, is properly to be drawn only at the end of the jury’s deliberations, once all the evidence has been considered.&nbsp; Hiving such evidence off at the outset and subjecting it to a separate reasonable doubt analysis creates a logical conundrum and raises the very real danger that the jury will never consider all the evidence together. . . .</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">. . . It is preferable simply, in the spirit of <i>Morin</i>, to leave evidence of flight or concealment evaluated, but somewhat at large until the final stage of putting all the evidence together and seeing if it proves the case beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; As previously noted, there is a risk that juries might jump too quickly from evidence of post-offence conduct to an inference of guilt.&nbsp; However, the best way for a trial judge to address that danger is simply to make sure that the jury are aware of any other explanations for the accused’s actions, and that they know they should reserve their final judgment about the meaning of the accused’s conduct until all the evidence has been considered in the normal course of their deliberations.&nbsp; Beyond such a cautionary instruction, the members of jury should be left to draw whatever inferences they choose from the evidence at the end of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
