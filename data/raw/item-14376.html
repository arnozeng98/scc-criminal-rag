Where the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> intends to differentiate between consent to treatment and consent to a disposition order, it does so expressly.</span></p>

In setting the start date for treatment, the judge will consider bed shortages, but she does so along with the liberty, security and procedural fairness interests of the accused, as well as assessing the impact on the accused of waiting in jail and the delays to the trial.&nbsp; If the court attaches what the hospital considers to be unreasonable conditions to a treatment order, the hospital may exercise its statutory right of appeal, and benefit from the automatic stay.</span></p>

As we see it, that reading of the relevant provisions of the<i> </i><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>, cannot be reconciled with its unambiguous text. The <i>Code</i> specifically distinguishes between consent to treatment and consent to the disposition and explicitly requires that a disposition may not be made without the hospital‚Äôs consent. The hospital consent is required for the disposition order in its entirety, not simply to the treatment aspect of it. Read any other way, the appeal provisions relating to dispositions are incoherent. Moreover, the interpretation that we favour is consistent with the purpose of the scheme and the broader context in which it exists.</p>

It noted that a memorandum of understanding between CAMH and 102 Mental Health Court provided a form of general consent to the placement and treatment of accused persons.&nbsp; It held that this memorandum implicitly provided that hospitals would have the necessary facilities, personnel, and resources for effective and safe treatment.&nbsp; It held that this implied that admission would be withheld when a bed was not available for safety reasons.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal accepted that a mentally unfit accused person‚Äôs right to liberty and security of the person is engaged <a name="PNUM_34">but that</a> the consent requirement in s.&nbsp;672.62(1)(<i>a</i>) does not violate the principle of fundamental justice requiring procedural fairness because the consent requirement responds to a general reluctance in law to compel a medical practitioner or hospital authorities to administer treatment; it responds to the common law‚Äôs unwillingness to compel someone to submit involuntarily to medical treatment by assuring that ‚Äúthe treatment order process is initiated and . . . lik<a name="PNUM_55">ely to produce positive results‚Äù (para. 52);</a> it responds to the significant risks to patients and to medical personnel, hospital staff and others when potentially violent psychotic patients are detained in settings where proper facilities are not available; and it permits Ontario‚Äôs forensic psychiatric facilities to co-operate in triaging the needs of UST and NCR accused, matters not within the knowledge of the courts. The Court of Appeal concluded <span style="line-height:200%">that it is not unreasonable </span>that a UST accused may have to wait on some occasions for a short period of time until a bed becomes available in a designated psychiatric facility and there was no evidence that a six-day delay in starting treatment might impair the likelihood of the appellant becoming fit to stand trial.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This issue raises a question of statutory interpretation which must be resolved according to the modern principle of statutory interpretation: ‚Äúthe words of an Act are to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament‚Äù (R. Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i> (5th ed. 2008), at p. 1, citing E. A. Driedger, <i>The Construction of Statutes</i> (1974), at p.&nbsp;67). We underline that the starting point is the text of the provisions in their grammatical and ordinary sense. This is especially the case where, as here, the key term ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù is expressly defined in the statute. In our view, the appellant fails to do this.</p>
 <p class="Title3LevelTitre3Niveau" style="text-indent:1.8pt"><span style="text-decoration:none">(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Statutory Context and Statutory Text</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[15]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is helpful to begin by putting the most relevant provisions in their wider statutory context. The relevant provisions are found within Part XX.1 of the <i>Code</i> which deals with mental disorder. The twin purposes of this Part of the <i>Code</i> are protection of the public and fair treatment, in the sense of procedural fairness, of the accused:&nbsp; <i>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at paras. 20, 21 and 44; see also <i>Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services)</i>, 2006 SCC 7, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 326, at para.&nbsp;27.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Code</i> provides that no court shall make a ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù under s.&nbsp;672.58 without the consent of the hospital or person in charge of treatment. The provisions respecting ‚Äúdispositions‚Äù are central to the legislative scheme set out in Part XX.1 of the <i>Code. </i>Several provisions give both a court and a Review Board the authority to make various dispositions in relation to persons falling within the ambit of Part XX.1.&nbsp; Under the scheme, courts reach a ‚Äúverdict‚Äù (respecting fitness to stand trial and criminal responsibility), both courts and Review Boards make a ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù (in relation to persons found UST and not criminally responsible) and Review Boards make a ‚Äúplacement decision‚Äù (with respect to a ‚Äúdual status offender‚Äù, that is, a person who is both serving a sentence of imprisonment and is subject to a custodial disposition under Part XX.1).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[17]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key point is that ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù is a technical term, used throughout Part XX.1. While a disposition ordering treatment may be referred to as a ‚Äútreatment order‚Äù in colloquial language, there is no such thing provided for in the <i>Code. </i>&nbsp;‚ÄúDisposition‚Äù is a defined term.&nbsp; In the context of dispositions made by courts, a ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù is defined by s. 672.1 as meaning ‚Äú<u>an order</u> made by a court‚Äù under s.&nbsp;672.54 or s. 672.58, the latter being the provision that concerns us here.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[20]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Code </i>provides that ‚Äú[n]o court shall make a disposition under section&nbsp;672.58 without the consent of (<i>a</i>) the person in charge of the hospital where the accused is to be treated; or (<i>b</i>) the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused is assigned by the court‚Äù: s. 672.62. At paragraph 109, our colleague suggests that s. 672.62 provides for hospital consent with respect to only the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù aspect of the disposition, and not the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù generally. With respect, this is not how we read s. 672.62. If ‚Äú[n]o court shall make a disposition .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. consent‚Äù, then the consent relates to the disposition. Further, as just discussed, a ‚Äúdisposition under section 672.58‚Äù necessarily has a temporal element. The hospital must consent to the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù; there is nothing in the text to suggest that this requirement should be given anything other than its defined meaning in the <i>Code</i>. Consent is required to a ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù and ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù is defined to mean ‚Äúan order made by a court under section 672.58‚Äù: s. 672.1. Thus the hospital‚Äôs consent is required to the disposition which the court makes under s. 672.58, not simply to certain aspects of it.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is supported by the meaning of the word ‚Äúconsent‚Äù and the context in which it is used in these provisions.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ordinary meaning of the word ‚Äúconsent‚Äù in the context of medical treatment is understood to be voluntary agreement to a medical course of action made with an appreciation of all material information and risks. The starting date of treatment is a material fact, going to the availability of the necessary bed and staff ready to execute the treatment order safely.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The context in which the word ‚Äúconsent‚Äù is used in this scheme supports this broad understanding of the term.&nbsp; Where the <i>Code</i> intends to differentiate between consent to treatment and consent to a disposition order, it does so expressly.&nbsp; For example, in s. 672.62, subsection 1 deals with the hospital‚Äôs consent to ‚Äúa disposition‚Äù whereas subsection 2 deals with the accused‚Äôs consent to ‚Äútreatment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pursuant to a disposition‚Äù.&nbsp; Had the intention been to simply require the hospital‚Äôs consent to the proposed treatment, language similar to that used in subsection 2, which links consent only to the treatment, could have made that intent clear.&nbsp; Instead, subsection 1 links the hospital‚Äôs consent to the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù not merely to the ‚Äútreatment of an accused .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. carried out pursuant to a disposition‚Äù as in subsection 2. This demonstrates that Parliament, which took care to define the term ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù, used the term in its defined sense ‚Äî as it did in relation to hospital consent under s. 672.62(1) ‚Äî and used different language to refer only to the treatment component of a disposition ‚Äî as it did in relation to the accused‚Äôs consent in s. 672.62(2).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù is a defined term meaning the ‚Äúorder made by a court under section 672.58‚Äù and the <i>Code</i> explicitly requires the hospital‚Äôs consent to a disposition under that section, we see no possible ambiguity in the text of these provisions. Any possible doubt is dispelled by the clear distinction in s. 672.62 between, on the one hand, the hospital‚Äôs consent to the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù which is required under s. 672.62(1) and, on the other hand, the accused‚Äôs consent to ‚Äútreatment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. carried out pursuant to a disposition‚Äù which is not required. We do not see how Parliament could have more clearly expressed its intent that the hospital‚Äôs consent in s. 672.62(1) relates to all the provisions of the disposition, including when treatment will begin as well as what is to be done.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our colleague Karakatsanis J. reads the appeal provisions in Part XX.1 as supporting the appellant‚Äôs view that consent to a disposition order does not require consent to the timing aspects of the disposition order. We respectfully disagree.&nbsp; As we see it, the interpretation that we propose is reinforced, not weakened, by the appeal provisions in Part XX.1. Under s. 672.72(1), ‚Äú[a]ny party may appeal against a disposition made by a court .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on any ground of appeal that raises a question of law or fact alone or of mixed law and fact.‚Äù&nbsp; This, of course, is the provision that allowed the hospital in this case to appeal the judge‚Äôs ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù disposition order.&nbsp; However, the appellant contends that the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù under s. 672.58 does not include the timing of the treatment which is ordered. It follows that, on the appellant‚Äôs reading of the <i>Code</i>, the term ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù means something different in ss. 672.58 and 672.62 than it does in s. 672.72.&nbsp; If, as the appellant contends, consent to a ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù as required by s. 672.62 does not require consent as to timing of treatment, it must follow that an appeal under s. 672.72 from a ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù cannot relate to the timing of the treatment either. Respectfully, this simply cannot be the case. ‚ÄúDisposition‚Äù is a defined term: it means an ‚Äúorder made by a court under section 672.58‚Äù.&nbsp; The term ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù must bear this meaning everywhere it is used in Part XX.1 of the <i>Code. </i>The appellant offers no explanation as to why the express definition of the term applies in the appeal provisions but not in the treatment disposition provisions even though both the consent requirement and the right of appeal relate to a disposition under s. 672.58.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also, respectfully, cannot agree that if the hospital‚Äôs consent were required to the timing aspect of a disposition, there would be no point in providing the hospital with a right of appeal as it could simply refuse to consent. This case shows that this line of argument is incorrect. The appeal process under Part XX.1 permitted the judge‚Äôs forthwith order in this case to be appealed and her legal error in making it to be corrected on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that consent in relation to a s. 672.58 disposition order must not include timing because the institutions do not have any right to refuse to accept immediately patients on other court-ordered placements as, for example, under s. 672.11 (psychiatric assessments) and s. 672.54(<i>c</i>) and s.&nbsp;672.46(2)&nbsp; (transfers to a psychiatric institution or to a hospital). In effect, the appellant urges us to infer from the fact that hospital consent to timing is not required in these situations that it similarly should not be required under s. 672.62. We cannot agree.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 672.58 is unique in that it requires an accused to be subject to treatment and authorizes medical personnel to administer it without the accused‚Äôs consent. The section is not concerned simply with admission but with treatment upon admission. Thus, the provision deals with distinct situations and this argues against drawing any inference from distinct and different provisions about the meaning of this one. Moreover, any potential inference that might otherwise be drawn from the absence of a consent requirement in these other provisions is negated by the language in s. 672.62. It expressly makes the hospital‚Äôs consent relate to the disposition order itself, not simply to the treatment to be carried out pursuant to it.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the respondent Attorney General of Ontario that the purposes of this scheme point to a broad understanding of the requirement for hospital consent.</p>

First, it directs that treatment of an accused be carried out without the accused‚Äôs consent. The exceptional nature of this power was noted by the then Justice Minister Kim Campbell when she introduced the legislation in 1991:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:13.7pt">At present, there is no power to order a person detained pursuant to a Lieutenant-Governor‚Äôs warrant to submit to treatment involuntarily.&nbsp; Apart from emergency, there is no power to treat an accused without obtaining consent. We have concluded that the <u>general rule preventing the involuntary treatment of mentally disordered accused</u> ought to be preserved.&nbsp; However, <u>subject to stringent safeguards</u>, the bill permits a court to order involuntary treatment to make the accused fit to stand trial, thereby avoiding a potentially lengthy period of detention. [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="margin-left:0in">(<i>House of Commons Debates</i>, vol. 3, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., October 4, 1991, at pp. 3297-98)</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Code</i> establishes a number of special protections that highlight the unusual nature of this power. As provided for in s. 672.59, the order may only be made if the court is satisfied on the basis of testimony from a medical practitioner that a specific treatment should be administered for the purpose of making the accused fit to stand trial. That testimony must fulfill the detailed criteria set out in s. 672.59(2), including that the treatment is the least restrictive and least intrusive that could be specified for the purpose and that the risk of harm to the accused is not disproportionate to its anticipated benefit.&nbsp; The accused has important procedural rights including notice, and the right to challenge the application and certain treatments including the performance of psychosurgery or electro-convulsive therapy are not permitted: ss. 672.6 and 672.61.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, by necessary implication, it authorizes medical personnel to carry out that treatment against the accused‚Äôs wishes. This is a remarkable provision, given that informed consent of the patient is generally the <i>sine qua non</i> of medical treatment. However, s. 672.62, by requiring consent of the hospital or the person responsible for the accused‚Äôs treatment, makes it clear that this provision does not oblige them to carry out the court‚Äôs disposition order without their consent.&nbsp; As the Court noted in <i>Mazzei</i>, doing so ‚Äúwould constitute interference with the authority and responsibility of hospital authorities to provide medical services to persons in their custody according to <i>their </i>view of what is appropriate and effective‚Äù: para. 34 (emphasis in original).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That understanding serves the purpose of safeguarding the accused; hospital consent is one of the ‚Äústringent safeguards‚Äù referred to by Minister Campbell and is designed to ensure that the order can be carried out safely, both with regard to the accused, other patients and medical personnel. Parliament also intended to respect the important role of the treatment provider and to acknowledge how intrusive these provisions are, not only in relation to the accused but in relation to the institutions and personnel who are called on to administer treatment against the patient‚Äôs will.&nbsp; The provisions recognize the importance of the treatment provider‚Äôs clinical judgment, not only as to the particular treatment but as to the location, among those designated by the Minister of Health, at which it is to be carried out.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[35]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This broad understanding of the scope of the required consent is reinforced by the practical realities of providing involuntary treatment to potentially dangerous individuals. The timing of a treatment order for UST accused must be an element of the hospital‚Äôs consent because, from the hospital‚Äôs perspective, the time at which treatment is to be provided is inextricably linked to the hospital‚Äôs ability to provide treatment safely and effectively. The context of the involuntary treatment of a UST accused involves a number of safety considerations. Special precautions must be made when treating these individuals in order to protect the accused, other patients, staff and the public at large. These measures include all rooms being designed for single occupancy only, double air locking doors, furniture specially designed so it cannot be used as a weapon, specially trained staff, perimeter security, sally ports and specialized automated locking doors. If these facilities are not available at a given time, these safety concerns cannot be adequately met and the treatment cannot be provided safely.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant would have us draw a line between ‚Äúsuitability of treatment‚Äù ‚Äî that is, whether a specific UST accused will benefit from the type of treatment recommended to which the hospital must consent ‚Äî and ‚Äútiming of treatment‚Äù as to which its consent is not required. However, this is an artificial distinction in the real world of involuntary hospital treatment. It ignores the fact that the ability of the hospital to administer the suitable treatment is inextricably linked to whether it has the facilities and personnel available to do so. A treatment is not suitable if it cannot be administered.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The artificiality of the distinction between ‚Äúsuitability‚Äù and ‚Äútiming‚Äù can be seen by looking at the difference between a hospital that does not have the facilities at all and a hospital that does not have the facilities available ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù. Not all hospitals are equipped to handle the most dangerous offenders; they simply do not have the appropriate facilities. Surely, a hospital can refuse to consent to treat a very dangerous offender if it does not have the appropriate facilities to handle him or her. This would not be considered a question of timing. Similarly, a hospital can acknowledge that a UST accused needs specific treatment, but recognize it does not have the proper facilities to treat him or her immediately. In both these cases, the hospital would be unable to provide safe treatment and therefore would be entitled to withhold consent under s. 672.62(1) because the hospital is not suited to safely treat the UST accused at that time. Timing is therefore an essential element of suitability and not distinct from it. Consent under s. 672.62(1) of the <i>Code</i> must therefore include timing.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreting consent to exclude the element of timing, as the appellant would have us do, leaves allocation of scarce medical and hospital resources to those needing treatment squarely in the hands of the courts. This undermines the ability of hospitals to make medical triage decisions, which could not have been the intent of Parliament in enacting s. 672.62(1) of the <i>Code</i>. In making a ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù treatment order, judges are necessarily deciding who will <i>not</i> get treatment forthwith just as they are deciding who will.&nbsp; Judges would be deciding who should get medical treatment first, but without any overall sense of the needs and priorities of others who their ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù orders are displacing. Judges would, in effect, be making medical triage decisions but without the benefit of being informed about the other patients awaiting attention.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This scheme requires a co-operative and mutually respectful approach if it is to function, and we encourage that approach. However, our colleague‚Äôs suggestion at paras. 118 and 122 of her reasons that judges should routinely inquire into matters of bed availability or the hospital‚Äôs ability to safely carry out treatment immediately cannot have been Parliament‚Äôs intent in enacting the hospital consent provision. It does not strike us as likely that this scheme intended that the scarce resources of both the courts and the health care system should be devoted to judges micromanaging medical triage decisions and health care providers defending their triage decisions in court. Moreover, a judge‚Äôs decision to overrule the hospital on these matters may well affect the important rights and interests of other people needing treatment.&nbsp; Quite apart from the impracticality of seeing the judge‚Äôs role in this way, it also undermines rather than furthers the broader objectives of protecting the rights of the accused as well as those of others needing treatment and the broader public. We do not think, with respect, that these are matters that Parliament intended should routinely be decided by judges making disposition orders under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec672.58" target="_blank">s. 672.58<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp;</p>

To the extent that it has any potential to infringe the accused‚Äôs s.&nbsp;7 rights, we agree with the respondent CAMH that any potential violation of s. 7 rights results from the exercise of the hospital‚Äôs discretion to withhold consent conferred in s. 672.62(1) in a particular case, and is not inherent in the section itself.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[42]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No such breach was established. As the Court of Appeal pointed out, there is no evidence that a six-day delay in starting treatment might impair the likelihood of the appellant becoming fit to stand trial within the 60-day statutory window provided in s. 672.59(2), and there is no suggestion that the six-day delay in any other respect infringed the appellant‚Äôs right to life, liberty or security of the person. There is, accordingly, no basis on which to find that the hospital‚Äôs exercise of discretion not to consent to immediate admission for treatment had any unconstitutional effects on the appellant.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, although we think it would be exceedingly rare, we would not rule out this possibility in other cases. A judge proposing to make a disposition is entitled to consider, in an appropriate case, whether a refusal of consent will have the effect of unconstitutionally limiting the accused‚Äôs rights to life, liberty or security of the person in a fashion that does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice. If so persuaded, the judge would also be entitled to consider whether ordering an immediate admission would constitute an appropriate and just remedy for that breach.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene (MHCP), and the Attorney General of Ontario, say that the hospital‚Äôs right to consent means that it must agree to all the terms and conditions of the treatment order before it can be issued.&nbsp; When there are<i> </i>bed shortages, hospitals have the right to determine when treatment will commence.&nbsp; Orders for treatment to start ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù can result in overcrowding, compromising the safety of patients and staff, and the priority of other patients.&nbsp; Hospitals are in the best position to triage patients, and they can withhold consent on that basis.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[50]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Mr. Conception, says that the judge must have the final say as to when treatment will commence.&nbsp; The hospital would only be able to assess the medical interests of the accused, in relation to other (waiting) patients, whereas the judge is able to consider all the interests at stake, including the alternative detention or release arrangements for the accused.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the hospital‚Äôs consent is not required to all the terms and conditions of the treatment order.&nbsp; When the consent requirement is read in its proper statutory context, it is clear that hospital consent is required for the specified treatment.&nbsp; The hospital must be willing, on medical grounds, to administer the particular treatment.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bed shortages and patient wait lists ‚Äï the need to manage general resource pressures ‚Äï do not permit a hospital to refuse, or defer, consent.&nbsp; It is the judge who will consider bed availability, along with the accused‚Äôs liberty and security interests and the need for procedural fairness, in determining the timing of the treatment order.&nbsp; The hospital can advise the judge of any concerns about its ability to safely carry out the treatment on the date specified by the judge, even if it were to give the accused priority.&nbsp; Should the hospital consider the timing unreasonable, it may appeal the judge‚Äôs decision and the treatment order will be automatically stayed.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent hospitals, as well as the Attorneys General, say that the hospital‚Äôs consent is required for all aspects of the treatment order.&nbsp; For the order to be valid, the hospital must agree not only to perform the treatment, but also to the timing and any other conditions of the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù.&nbsp; A treatment order cannot issue without the hospital‚Äôs agreement to all aspects of the order.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that the hospital‚Äôs consent need only extend to its willingness to administer the specified treatment.&nbsp; The hospital cannot use the consent requirement to control the timing or other conditions of treatment, particularly based on bed shortages and waiting lists.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the hospital‚Äôs consent is required only to the treatment itself, and cannot be withheld on the basis of efficient management of hospital resources.&nbsp; The hospital consent requirement must be read in the context of Part XX.1 of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; A contextual reading makes clear that the consent provisions do not permit the hospitals to make decisions about the timing of the treatment (and by extension, the timing of the trial and the interim detention conditions of the accused) based on the medical priority of an accused against other patients on the waiting list for a bed.&nbsp; In setting the start date for treatment, the judge will consider bed shortages, but she does so along with the liberty, security and procedural fairness interests of the accused, as well as assessing the impact of waiting in jail and the delays to the trial.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before a judge can make a treatment order, the consent provision under s.&nbsp;672.62(1) requires that a hospital indicate it is willing to administer the treatment.&nbsp; The hospital may only refuse consent if it objects to the specified treatment on medical grounds.&nbsp; In exceptional circumstances, the lack of a bed, or other alternative, may mean that the hospital is not able to safely carry out the treatment ‚Äï even if the hospital gives the accused priority for the date chosen by the judge.&nbsp; In such cases, if the hospital believes that the judge has acted unreasonably in setting the date, it can appeal and the decision can be reviewed.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that the treatment order provisions separate the medical appropriateness of the treatment from its timing.&nbsp; Consent is required only with respect to the treatment.&nbsp; While s. 672.58 refers to the court making an order directing that ‚Äútreatment . . . be carried out for a specified period‚Äù (this is the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù), s. 672.63 separately directs that ‚Äú[a] disposition shall come into force on the day on which it is made or on any later day that the court or Review Board specifies in it‚Äù.&nbsp; Thus, the disposition itself ‚Äï which requires hospital consent, according to s. 672.62(1)(<i>a</i>) ‚Äï may be separate from the date that it comes into force, or commences, which s. 672.63 authorizes the court to specify.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that s. 672.62(1) makes hospital consent a prerequisite to any treatment disposition.&nbsp; However, the issue remains: to what does the consent relate?&nbsp; Is consent required to all terms and conditions of the ‚Äúdisposition‚Äù?&nbsp; Or is consent merely required to the specified treatment?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not find the respondents‚Äô submissions on the language of s. 672.62 determinative.&nbsp; Section 672.62(1) does not provide that the consent is required for all aspects of the disposition; rather, it says that the disposition under s. 672.58 cannot be made without the consent of the hospital or person treating the accused.&nbsp; Further, the judge may fix the timing of the disposition pursuant to s. 672.63.&nbsp; The disposition under s. 672.58 is an order directing the treatment of the accused for a specified period (a maximum duration of 60 days), together with any conditions the judge considers appropriate.&nbsp; Obviously, if consent to the treatment is not provided, there can be no disposition ordering such treatment.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the language of these provisions, read in isolation, does not provide a clear answer to the scope of a hospital‚Äôs discretion to withhold consent.&nbsp; However, the modern rule of statutory interpretation requires that ‚Äúthe words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament‚Äù: E. A. Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i> (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87.&nbsp; Here, interpreting the provisions in light of (1) the purposes of Part XX.1, the treatment order regime and the consent requirement, (2) the scheme of strict judicial control and oversight with strict timelines, and (3) the appeal and automatic stay provisions, leads to the conclusion that the requirement for hospital consent relates only to a hospital‚Äôs willingness to deliver a particular treatment.&nbsp; It does not provide the hospital with a veto over the terms and conditions of the treatment order, nor one that can be exercised for any reason.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[132]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the hearing judge was concerned generally about unfit accused waiting in jail, and the impact of the delay upon their mental health.&nbsp; However, she did not base her decision upon the specific circumstances of this case in issuing a ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù treatment order.&nbsp; There was no discussion of the impact on the offender‚Äôs treatment prospects resulting from a delay; the holding conditions in the jail where he would likely be sent to wait; or any possible alternatives to detention while waiting for a bed.&nbsp; And there was no information about whether the hospital could safely administer treatment immediately, if so ordered, or when safe treatment could be provided, if he was given priority.&nbsp; These are relevant factors that could have assisted the judge in the exercise of her discretion to issue a treatment order in this case.&nbsp; Like many others at the time, the judge made the treatment order in good faith, but out of frustration with the mental health system‚Äôs inability to immediately accommodate patients under treatment orders.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[133]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the judge erred in issuing a ‚Äúforthwith‚Äù treatment order.&nbsp; I would dismiss the appeal without costs.</p>
