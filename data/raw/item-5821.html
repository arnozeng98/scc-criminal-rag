   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Respondent was charged with a contravention of s.&nbsp;5(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>of the <i>Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations. </i>The Regulations were not produced at trial and Crown counsel neither asked that judicial notice be taken of them nor implied that they had been published. The trial judge concluded that he could not take judicial notice of them and dismissed the case. On appeal by way of stated case the Appeal Division unanimously held that the trial judge was correct in law.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Laskin C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The Regulations P.C. 1971-2005, SOR/71-495 were published in the <i>Canada Gazette, </i>vol. 105 at p.&nbsp;1723. Section 23(1) of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>can be interpreted in two</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 98]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">ways <i>either </i>that the words identify the class of instruments that must be judicially noticed without any evidence of any type being offered <i>or </i>that the words impose a condition precedent, of proving the publication, before judicial notice can be taken. Not all statutory instruments are published in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>and if the latter interpretation were accepted subs. (1) would be made completely useless, subs. (2) being sufficient for very easily proving the existence, publication and contents of the instrument. No enactment should be thus deleted from a statute unless no other conclusion is possible.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">A comparison of s.&nbsp;23 of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>with ss. 18 and 19 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act </i>shows that both impose judicial notice as an obligation but also provide, as a material support for that obligation, that a document not otherwise admissible may be used. Thus the purpose of s.&nbsp;23(2) becomes apparent, the subsection&nbsp;is not useless any more than s.&nbsp;19 of the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Canada</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA"> Evidence Act</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA"></span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA">. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Section 23(3) has no role in the problem but completes s.&nbsp;23(2) with respect to a consolidation. All three subs. of s.&nbsp;23 have a meaning which would not be so if the judgment appealed from was well founded. This meaning results from Parliament’s decision to place on the same footing the statutory instruments published in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>and all Acts of Canada, public or private.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Laskin C.J. and Spence J. <i>dissenting: </i>Crown counsel at the trial made no request for judicial notice and took no step to place the relevant Regulations before the Court. Section 23 of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>is a departure from strict common law methods of proof of documents. If there was to be a wholesale dispensation of proof to enable judicial notice to be taken clearer language should have been used than that of s.&nbsp;23 considered as a whole. To read s.&nbsp;23(1) otherwise than as requiring antecedent proof of publication in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>would make s.&nbsp;23(3) redundant. There was nothing inconsistent in making judicial notice of a regulation dependent on proof of publication which would not in itself necessarily prove the contents of the regulation.</span></p>

   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">Graham Pinos, for the appellant.</span></p> 
   <p class="Sollicitors"><span lang="EN-CA">Hugh H. McLellan and Anthony Allman, for the respondent.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was delivered by</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">THE CHIEF JUSTICE (<i>dissenting</i>)—This appeal by the Crown, which comes here by leave of this Court from adverse judgments of Provincial Court Judge George and the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, concerns a question of judicial notice of the federal Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations under which a charge was laid against the respondent ship.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The factual circumstances underlying this question are beyond belief. Crown counsel at the hearing of the charge apparently did not have the Regulations upon which the charge was founded with him or, if he did, he kept them concealed. They were not produced to the Court in any way, nor were they referred to by counsel or by any</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 100]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">witness. At the conclusion of the evidence and when argument was commenced by Crown counsel, the Provincial Judge drew attention to the fact that the Regulations had not been brought before him in any way. Crown counsel did not ask the Court to take judicial notice of the Regulations and did not state or even imply that the Regulations had ever been published. In this state of affairs (as recounted by the trial judge in a stated case that was sought by counsel for the Attorney General of Canada), and defence counsel not replying or signifying assent to the Court’s inquiry whether he would agree to having the Regulations placed before the Court, the trial judge dismissed the charge. The New Brunswick Court of Appeal was unanimous in dismissing the Crown’s appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">When a court takes judicial notice of a fact or of a law it dispenses with the production of evidence to prove it. At common law, judicial notice was taken of public or general statutes but not of private enactments nor of subordinate legislation such as orders-in-council or regulations. By legislation of a common variety, such as is found in s.&nbsp;18 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c.&nbsp;E-10 and s.&nbsp;70(1) of the New Brunswick <i>Evidence Act, </i>R.S.N.B. 1973, c.&nbsp;E-11, judicial notice is obligatory of all statutes, public or private. Hence, it is unecessary under such a dispensation to produce to the Court the text of a piece of legislation, although this would invariably be done when its interpretation is in issue.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Where subordinate or delegated legislation, such as orders of regulations, is in issue, there is no such mandatory and unqualified general provision respecting judicial notice thereof as is found in legislation respecting judicial notice of statutes. It was not suggested by the appellant in the present case that there is any common law rule of judicial notice of orders or regulations. There are instances in American case law where judicial notice has been taken of orders and regulations (see <i>Wigmore on Evidence, </i>3rd ed., vol. 9, No. 2572, at p.&nbsp;553), and the <i>Model Code of Evidence </i>of the American Law Institute in Rules 802 and 803 supports the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 101]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">obligatory taking of judicial notice of orders or regulations, but only if a request is made to that end, proper notice is given to the other side and sufficient information is given to the Court to enable it to comply with the request. These requirements are easily met in the case of orders and regulations and, while I do not, and need not for the purposes of the present case, suggest that this should be the law in this country, I must reiterate that Crown counsel at the trial made no request for judicial notice and took no step to place the relevant Regulations before the Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Two submissions were made by the appellant Crown to support its contention that judicial notice had to be taken of the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations, despite the absence of any reference to them or any exhibition or production of their text or of any document containing them. The submissions rest, respectively, on s.&nbsp;23(1) of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act, </i>1970‑71-72 (Can.), c.&nbsp;38 and on s.&nbsp;715 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>R.S.C. 1970, c.&nbsp;C-34. I shall deal with these submissions in reverse order.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 715 reads as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">715.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) No order, conviction or other proceeding shall be quashed or set aside, and no defendant shall be discharged, by reason only that evidence has not been given</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>of a proclamation or order of the Governor in Council or the lieutenant governor in council;</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>of rules, regulations or by-laws, made by the Governor in Council under an Act of the Parliament of Canada or by the lieutenant governor in council under an Act of the legislature of the province; or</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation2"><span lang="EN-CA">(<i>c</i>)<i> </i>of the publication of a proclamation, order, rule, regulation or by-law in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>or in the official gazette for the province.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) Proclamations, orders, rules, regulations and by-laws mentioned in subsection&nbsp;(1) and the publication thereof shall be judicially noticed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown relies on s.&nbsp;715(2) to support its submission on judicial notice. The contention is untenable here because s.&nbsp;715 is in Part XXIII of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>of which the heading is “Extraordinary Remedies”. The opening section&nbsp;in this Part</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 102]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">is s.&nbsp;708 which provides that “This Part applies to proceedings in criminal matters by way of <i>certiorari, habeas corpus, mandamus </i>and prohibition.” These so-called prerogative remedies are distinguishable from an appeal, whether an appeal in the broad sense or an appeal, as here, by stated case. It seems to me difficult to torture s.&nbsp;715(2) into a provision of general application when it is related clearly to the prerogative remedies which give a special and limited range of review. The Crown sought to draw nourishment for its submission as to s.&nbsp;715(2) from the dissenting reasons of Bull J.A. in <i>R. v</i>. <i>Markin</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Arial">[2]</span></span></span></a><i>, </i>at p.&nbsp;27, but those reasons simply ignore the context in which s.&nbsp;715(2) appears, not to mention its limitation to prerogative remedies by virtue of s.&nbsp;708.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">There is, in my opinion, nothing anomalous in extending the doctrine of judicial notice to orders and regulations where they are involved in proceedings that are attacked by the prerogative writs and in otherwise letting the ordinary laws of evidence apply to their proof or having proof made under facilitating legislation, such as is found in s.&nbsp;21 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act, </i>or by reliance on s.&nbsp;23(1) of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act. </i>When a number of procedures, each one different, are provided for questioning an order or a conviction or an acquittal, it may well be the case that a fuller range of grounds of reversal may be attached to one or more and not to another or others. The <i>Criminal Code </i>provides generous scope for a first appeal, especially in summary conviction matters. In respect of these, there may be a straight appeal which is by trial <i>de novo </i>under s.&nbsp;755, or an appeal by way of stated case restricted to errors of law or of jurisdiction under s.&nbsp;762. In neither of these procedures is there any special curative provision respecting judicial notice of orders or regulations, as there is under s.&nbsp;715(2). No doubt, the alleged defect which is in issue here could be cured upon an appeal by trial <i>de novo, </i>but there is no curative provision where the appeal, as in the present case, is by stated case. Parliament has chosen to eliminate an evidentiary issue of want of proof of orders</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 103]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">or regulations where the procedure to quash is invoked under s.&nbsp;715; and by providing for judicial notice thereof it has simply narrowed the range of permissible objections under that special procedure which might be taken by an accused person. The advantage so given to the Crown under s.&nbsp;715 was not extended to appeals.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown’s principal submission invoked s.&nbsp;23(1) of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act, </i>and for proper consideration of that submission I set out the whole of s.&nbsp;23 which is as follows:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><b><span lang="EN-CA">23.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA"> (1) A statutory instrument that has been published in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>shall be judicially noticed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) In addition to any other manner of proving the existence or contents of a statutory instrument, evidence of the existence or contents of a statutory instrument may be given by the production of a copy of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>purporting to contain the text of the statutory instrument.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(3) For the purposes of this section, where a regulation is included in a copy of a consolidation of regulations purporting to be printed by the Queen’s Printer, that regulation shall be deemed to have been published in the <i>Canada Gazette.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown would have this Court read s.&nbsp;23(1) as if the words “that has been published in the <i>Canada Gazette” </i>were not there, and would thus equate s.&nbsp;23(1) with s.&nbsp;18 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act, </i>providing unqualifiedly for judicial notice of Acts of Parliament. The Crown supports its contention by alleging that to read s.&nbsp;23(1) as requiring antecedent proof of publication in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>would make it redundant in the light of s.&nbsp;23(2). I do not agree that this is so. Rather do I think that if the appellant Crown is correct, it would be s.&nbsp;23(2) that would be redundant. Moreover, agreeing as I do with the submission that meaning should be attributed to all parts of a connected enactment, the appellant Crown’s submission on s.&nbsp;23(1) would also make s.&nbsp;23(3) redundant. This provision shows another way in which proof of publication in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>may be shown, a way which does not require production of a copy of the <i>Canada Gazette.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 104]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I think it relevant as well to point out that what we have in s.&nbsp;23 of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>is a departure from strict common law methods of proof of documents, and if there is to be a wholesale dispensation of proof to enable judicial notice to be taken, clearer language should be expected than what appears in s.&nbsp;23 when it is considered as a whole. I add too that there is nothing inconsistent in making judicial notice of a regulation dependent on proof of a supporting fact, e.g. publication, which would not in itself necessarily prove the contents of the regulation. That, in my opinion, is what is stipulated in s.&nbsp;23(1). The mere fact that there may be overlapping provisions, as there undoubtedly are under s.&nbsp;23 of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>and s.&nbsp;21 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act, </i>does not warrant the reading out of inconvenient words in order to arrive at a clean result which would not only eliminate the overlapping but would eliminate these associated provisions even in those respects in which they do not overlap.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations were also involved in an issue of judicial notice in <i>R.&nbsp;v. The Vessel “Besseggen”</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[3]</span></span></span></a><i> </i>which came to the British Columbia Court of Appeal also by way of stated case. The majority of the Court, in sustaining the trial judge’s decision that he could take judicial notice of the Regulations, did so on the ground that a copy of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>containing the Regulations was produced to him, and hence what is now s.&nbsp;23(1) of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>was satisfied. The contrary view urged by counsel for the vessel and supported by the dissenting reasons of Branca J.A. was that it was necessary formally to prove the Regulations or to prove publication in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>as a fact before judicial notice could be taken. Branca J.A. founded his reasons on the basis that a copy of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>had not been produced to the trial judge. The factual difference between the members of the Court in the <i>Besseggen </i>case does not arise here, and my only observation on that case is that it would be a sufficient support for judicial notice to produce or hand up to the trial</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">judge a copy of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>containing the particular regulations.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">I have given thought to the question whether this Court, at this stage, should send the case back to the Provincial Court Judge with a direction that it be re-opened to permit Crown counsel to tender or produce a copy of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>or to show publication under s.&nbsp;23(3). This relief was not asked by the Crown either here or, so far as appears, in the New Brunswick Court of Appeal. Although the Crown was allowed to re-open its case in <i>R. v. Kishen Singh</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">[4]</span></span></span></a><i> </i>to repair inadvertent failure to prove a proclamation, bringing into force the statute under which the charge was laid, this was done by the trial judge and there was no prejudice to the accused. Here the Crown’s omission was not inadvertent, and at a distance of nearly four years since the charge was laid and nearly two years since the trial was held I am unwilling to guess that there would be no prejudice, nor do I think that the Crown deserves any indulgence.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">1) on the 1st of February 1972, an information was laid stating that the respondent has discharged a pollutant in the Harbour of Saint John in contravention of s.&nbsp;5(<i>b</i>)<i> </i>of the <i>Oil Pollution Prevention Regulations, </i>thereby committing an offence contrary to s.&nbsp;761 of the</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Canada Shipping Act </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">as amended by c.&nbsp;27 of the Statutes of Canada, 1970-71;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">2) the trial was held in Saint John before a judge of the Provincial Court and both parties presented their cases;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">3) during the argument, the judge pointed out to counsel for the Crown that the regulations referred to in the information had not been introduced formally in evidence, nor had a copy thereof even been submitted to the Court;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">4) counsel for the defence did not reply to the judge’s question if he would agree to have the regulations placed before the Court;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">5) no copy of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>containing the text of the regulations was produced at any time to the Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The trial judge concluded that he could not take judicial notice of the regulations and dismissed the information. By stated case, pursuant to s.&nbsp;762 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>the Court of Appeal was asked whether or not this holding was correct in law and gave a unanimous answer in the affirmative. With leave, the question is now before us.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In the courts below, the defence had also raised a question of jurisdiction in the trial judge. This point has been abandoned by respondent in her factum.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Court of Appeal has examined the question of judicial notice on the basis that the regulation, P.C. 1971-2005, SOR/71-495, which purport to have been made by the Governor General in Council pursuant to ss. 736 and 739 of the <i>Canada Shipping Act, </i>were published in vol. 105 of the <i>Canada Gazette, </i>at p.&nbsp;1723 and following. I agree with this approach.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">While four grounds had been raised by the Crown before the Court of Appeal in support of its submission, only two were pressed before us. Judicial notice of the regulations should have been taken</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 107]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">a) by virtue of s.&nbsp;715 of the <i>Criminal Code;</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">b) by virtue of s.&nbsp;23 of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act, </i>1970-71 (Can.), c.&nbsp;38.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Finding myself in agreement with the Crown on the second point, I will express no opinion on the first.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Section 23 reads:</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(1) A statutory instrument that has been published in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>shall be judicially noticed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) In addition to any other manner of proving the existence or contents of a statutory instrument, evidence of the existence or contents of a statutory instrument may be given by the production of a copy of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>purporting to contain the text of the statutory instrument.</span></p> 
   <p class="Citation1"><span lang="EN-CA">(3) For the purposes of this section, where a regulation is included in a copy of a consolidation of regulations purporting to be printed by the Queen’s Printer, that regulation shall be deemed to have been published in the <i>Canada Gazette.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is common ground that regulations are statutory instruments.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">What is the meaning of subs. (1)? There is no doubt that if it read “a statutory instrument shall be judicially noticed”, there would be no problem and the courts below would have taken judicial notice of the regulations. The difficulty arises because of the presence of the words “that has been published in the <i>Canada Gazette”. </i>So that the real question is to determine the meaning of the words just quoted in the context of the subsection:</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">a) one reading is that the words identify the class of instruments that must be judicially noticed without any evidence of any type being offered;</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">b) another reading is that the words impose a condition precedent thus creating the obligation to prove the publication before judicial notice can be taken of the instrument.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The Court of Appeal has opted for the second meaning after a full review of the cases pro and con. I prefer the first interpretation.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 108]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">All instruments are not printed in the <i>Canada Gazette; </i>ss. 6, 11 and 27 of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>make this point very clear. Parliament when it decided to enact the rule that statutory instruments should be judicially noticed, had to decide whether that rule would apply to all instruments or only to those published in the <i>Canada Gazette. </i>By subs. (1), it decided upon this last course. Thus by the words of the statute, the rule of judicial notice is limited to those instruments which in fact had been published in the <i>Gazette. </i>But this fact of publication needs no proof. To impose that condition as a preliminary step before judicial notice can be taken of an instrument is to make subs. 1 completely useless, subs. (2) being then entirely sufficient for the purpose of rendering very easy the proof of the existence, publication and contents of the instrument. No enactment should be thus deleted from a statute unless no other conclusion is possible.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">It is interesting to compare the treatment of the subject matter in the Act under consideration with that of the Acts of Parliament in the <i>Canada Evidence Act. </i>To facilitate this comparison, I give below, side by side, the relevant texts:</span></p>

   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[Page 109]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Thus, the purpose of subs. (2) of s.&nbsp;23 becomes apparent. Parliament has stated that judges and courts in the discharge of their obligation to take judicial notice of statutory instruments printed in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>and of all Acts of Parliament need not feel obliged to ascertain the original text but can well be satisfied with using the contents as printed by the Queen’s Printer. Thus, subs. (2) is not useless any more than s.&nbsp;19 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Subsection&nbsp;(3) of s.&nbsp;23 has no role in the problem under study. It deals with a narrower situation, namely consolidation of regulations, and completes subs. (2) by enacting that after such a consolidation, there is no need to go back to the number of the <i>Canada Gazette </i>where the regulation was originally published.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Thus, all three subsections&nbsp;of s.&nbsp;23 have a meaning, which is not the case if the judgment appealed from is well founded. This meaning is the result of Parliament’s decision to place on the same footing the statutory instruments published in the <i>Canada Gazette </i>and all Acts of Canada, public or private. This is a normal evolution in the light of the modern scientific possibilities to publish and to retrieve legal material. Till 1950, statutory instruments had to be proven under s.&nbsp;21 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act. </i>If s.&nbsp;23 of the <i>Statutory Instruments Act </i>does not add anything to that s.&nbsp;21, it is a remarkable piece of useless legislation.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">That evolution is not limited to Canada. In England where there is still, if I am well informed, no equivalent to s.&nbsp;23, subs.
