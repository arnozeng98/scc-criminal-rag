She found that individuals of various ages change their underwear or shower in dressing rooms, and thus can reasonably be expected to be nude in them, and that this finding was sufficient for the purposes of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec162subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;162(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(a).</span></span></p>

It concluded that the trial judge had failed to consider whether nudity was reasonably expected at the time when the offences allegedly occurred. It stated that s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) was intended to apply to persons who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. The dissenting judge would have dismissed the appeal. She was of the view that s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) contains no implicit temporal component; the provision instead focuses on the “place”, which, under s.&nbsp;162(1)(a), is a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, regardless of the expected use of that place specifically when the conduct occurred.</span></p>

Parliament’s objective of protecting privacy appears in the opening words of s.&nbsp;162(1), which refer to circumstances that give rise to<i> </i>a reasonable expectation of privacy. These are circumstances in which a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred. </span><span style="line-height:200%">As for </span><span style="line-height:
200%">Parliament’s objective of protecting sexual integrity, it is apparent in each of paras.&nbsp;(a), (b), and (c) of s.&nbsp;162(1). Section&nbsp;162(1)(a) protects the sexual integrity of persons in specific places. It does not require the person to be actually nude, exposing intimate parts of his or her body, or engaged in sexual activity; it suffices if they are in a place where a person may reasonably be expected to be in such a state, such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom. In addition, para.&nbsp;(a) does not require the accused to act for a sexual purpose. Section&nbsp;162(1)(b) protects the sexual integrity of persons engaged in specific activities: when the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity. Under para.&nbsp;(b), the nature of the location does not matter, but the accused must have the purpose of observing or recording the subject in such a state or engaged in such an activity. Similarly to para.&nbsp;(a), the Crown need not prove that the accused acted for a sexual purpose. Section&nbsp;162(1)(c) protects the sexual integrity of persons when the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose. It applies whether the subject is clothed or unclothed — no matter what they are doing, and regardless of the location of the targeted subject. The opening words of s.&nbsp;162(1) also protect sexual integrity, and each of paras.&nbsp;(a), (b), and (c) of s.&nbsp;162(1) also protect privacy.</span></p>

200%"> </span><span style="line-height:200%">is one </span><span style="line-height:200%">of statutory interpretation. The words in s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) must be considered in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. Section 162(1)(a) must be interpreted according to a textual, contextual, and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. </span>The text of s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) refers to a test for the “place” that is objective in two respects. First, s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) uses the definite article “<i>the</i> person” when referring to the subject of the observation or recording, but uses the indefinite article “<i>a</i> person” when referring to the reasonably expected uses of the place. This means that <i>the</i> person being surreptitiously observed or recorded must be in a place in which <i>a</i> person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Second, s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) asks whether a person can reasonably be expected to be nude in the place, and not whether the accused subjectively expected them to be nude.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The use of an objective test in s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) is not determinative of whether the provision contains a temporal component, however, because Parliament still might have intended that the objective evaluation be made at a specific time. The key textual point is the lack of express language in s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) suggesting that Parliament intended the “place” to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Had Parliament intended to insist on such a temporal component, it could have done so expressly by referring to the observation or recording being made in a place in which a person can then reasonably be expected to be nude, or being made in a place in which a person would reasonably be expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording.</p> 
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The statutory context and purpose of s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) also suggest that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component. Parliament’s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity are promoted by interpreting s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) as a location‑based offence without a temporal component. Rather than providing a specific list of places protected under s.&nbsp;162(1)(a), Parliament chose to define the protected places in a principled and normative way. Section&nbsp;162(1)(a) stipulates a rule that normatively identifies a class of quintessentially “safe places”, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms, in which people should be entitled to not be non‑consensually observed or visually recorded, whether or not they or another person in the place are reasonably expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording. An observation or recording in such a quintessentially “safe place” violates trust and can result in the person’s humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, or loss of self‑esteem, and can cause emotional and psychological harm, even if the person is not observed or recorded when nude. In this way, s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) protects privacy, as well as sexual integrity as it is understood today.</p>

A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (per Willcock J.A., Grauer J.A. concurring) disagreed with the trial judge’s interpretation, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge had failed to address conflicts in the evidence about whether nudity could reasonably be expected when the photos were taken.

In addition, Mr. Downes submits that if s. 162(1)(a) is interpreted as lacking a temporal component, then the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Mr. Downes did not raise this constitutional issue at trial. He raised it for the first time before the Court of Appeal, but the court did not address it.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par5" class="">5</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, properly interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose, s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) has no implicit temporal component. The text of s. 162(1)(a) lacks language suggesting that Parliament intended the “place” to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Further, as this Court observed in <i>Jarvis</i>, Parliament’s purposes in enacting the voyeurism offence were to protect individuals’ privacy and sexual integrity. Those purposes are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) without an implicit temporal component, and would be detracted from by reading in such a component. In effect, s. 162(1)(a) designates places such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms as “safe places” where people should be free from intrusions onto their privacy and sexual integrity, whether or not a person in the place could reasonably be expected to be nude or engaged in sexual activity at the specific time the person is surreptitiously observed or recorded. Finally, I would decline to address the constitutional issue because this is not an appropriate case for this Court to exceptionally exercise its discretion to decide such an issue for the first time on appeal. I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the convictions.</p>

Mr. Downes was the boys’ hockey coach. He also ran a sports photography business from his home.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par7" class="">7</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In March 2016, Canada Border Services Agency (“CBSA”) officers searched Mr. Downes’ electronic devices at the border when he returned to Canada from the United States after a brief shopping trip and found thousands of photos of children engaged in sporting activities. Some of the children were in locker rooms. Mr.&nbsp;Downes explained to the CBSA that the photos were from his sports photography business. Although none of the photos involved nudity or child pornography, the CBSA alerted the RCMP because of a concern that Mr. Downes might have child pornography on his home computer.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par8" class="">8</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2016, the RCMP obtained and executed a warrant to search Mr.&nbsp;Downes’ home and electronic devices. They found the photos of T.R. and G.C. that led to the voyeurism charges. The photos of T.R. were taken when he was 13 or 14 years old and show him sitting on a bench wearing only his underwear, revealing his crotch area and bare torso, or putting on street clothes after a hockey practice. The photos of G.C. were taken when he was about 12 years old and show him wearing only his underwear, wearing a shirt and underwear, or fully clothed; in some photos, G.C. is standing clothed at a sink in the washroom area of a dressing room. Mr.&nbsp;Downes told the RCMP that he liked young boys but that it was “not a sexual thing” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 207).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par9" class="">9</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Downes took the photos of T.R. and G.C. using his iPhone. He deleted some photos but emailed others to himself, downloaded them onto a computer, and copied them onto a USB stick. He also cropped some photos to focus on G.C.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par10" class="">10</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of T.R., G.C., or G.C.’s mother knew that Mr. Downes had taken the photos. The trial judge found that Mr. Downes likely knew that a hockey league rule prohibited the use of cell phones in dressing rooms to prevent photos being taken of children.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par11" class="">11</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, both parties led evidence about whether a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in a hockey dressing room. The evidence centred on whether boys would remove their underwear or shower in dressing rooms. T.R. and G.C. testified that they did not shower in dressing rooms, but that some of their teammates did. One of Mr. Downes’ former hockey players testified that he would change his underwear in dressing rooms, and although he did not shower, other players occasionally did. Another of Mr. Downes’ former hockey players testified that from ages 11 to 14 or 15 he never got completely naked or showered in dressing rooms and never saw others do so. Three hockey coaches (two of whom had coached with Mr.&nbsp;Downes) testified that boys of T.R. and G.C.’s ages rarely are naked or shower in dressing rooms; a former manager of one of Mr. Downes’ hockey teams testified to the same effect. One hockey coach explained that this was because boys of T.R. and G.C.’s ages are too self-conscious about their bodies. But it was common ground that children a little older than T.R. and G.C. and adults often are naked or shower in dressing rooms.</p>

She held that the Crown had proved the four elements of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a) beyond a reasonable doubt: Mr. Downes took the photos of T.R. and G.C. (1) intentionally, (2) surreptitiously, (3) in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (4) in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par13" class="">13</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge applied the contextual factors identified by this Court in <i>Jarvis</i> and found that T.R. and G.C. were in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. She noted that T.R. and G.C. were in a private or semi-private place set aside for dressing and undressing; their parents entrusted them to Mr. Downes, an experienced coach; and they did not expect to be photographed by their coach through the surreptitious use of a cell phone for non-instructional purposes. The trial judge ruled that although T.R. and G.C. would expect to be observed by others in the dressing room, they would not expect to be photographed, nor would they expect Mr.&nbsp;Downes to email photos of them to himself and to keep them long after he stopped having contact with them.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par14" class="">14</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Mr. Downes did not expressly argue that s. 162(1)(a) contains an implicit temporal component. Instead, he argued that the Crown had to prove that T.R. and G.C. were in a place in which <i>they</i> could reasonably be expected to be nude. He argued that the evidence showed that neither T.R. nor G.C. had any expectation of being nude in the dressing rooms in which they were photographed. The trial judge rejected that argument. She stated that s. 162(1)(a) focuses on the nature of the place in which an observation or recording is made, but does not require that the person who is the subject of the observation or recording was, or ever had been, nude, or that the person could reasonably be expected to be nude. It is sufficient under s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) that <i>a </i>person (not “<i>the</i> person”) could reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity. In the trial judge’s view, homes, bathrooms, and changing rooms are traditionally private or quasi-private places in which a person can reasonably expect privacy, and in which they can reasonably be expected to be nude or partially nude. The focus in s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) on the place in which an observation or recording is made recognizes that there are private or semi‑private spaces in which a person should be protected from being observed or recorded.</p>

She concluded that this finding was sufficient for the purposes of s.&nbsp;162(1)(a). As a result, the dressing rooms where Mr.&nbsp;Downes photographed T.R. and G.C. were places in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude.</p>

The majority concluded that the trial judge had failed to consider whether nudity was reasonably expected “at the time” when the offences allegedly occurred (paras. 40 and 55). The majority stated that s. 162(1)(a) was intended to apply to persons who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. In its view, s. 162(1)(a) does not criminalize an invasion of privacy alone. The majority noted that although Mr. Downes’ conduct involved a breach of trust and an invasion of privacy, that did not necessarily make it conduct that s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) criminalized as a sexual offence.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par17" class="">17</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority ruled that although it was open to the trial judge to find that nudity was reasonably expected in the dressing rooms in which T.R. and G.C. were photographed, she had failed to address conflicts in the evidence on whether nudity was expected at the time the photos were taken. The majority therefore ordered a new trial.</p>

In her view, s. 162(1)(a) contains no implicit temporal component; the provision instead focuses on the “place”. The relevant place under s. 162(1)(a) is “<i>a place</i> in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, exposing intimate body parts or engaging in sexual activity, regardless of the expected use of that place specifically when the conduct occurred” (para. 56 (emphasis in original)). She stated that when a person is in “a manifestly private place such as a bathroom or dressing room they are generally entitled to expect that they will not be surreptitiously observed or recorded there” (para. 92). In her view, Parliament intended to criminalize surreptitious observation or recording of persons in such places.</p>

His conduct was “seriously exploitative and personally invasive”, and was “appropriately criminalized as a form of sexual offence” (para. 97).</p>

In that case, this Court ruled that a high school teacher who used a camera concealed inside a pen to surreptitiously record female students at the school by focussing on their faces, upper bodies, and breasts, committed the offence of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(c) (“the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose”). The elements of the offence were established because the students were surreptitiously recorded in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy and the recordings were made for a sexual purpose.</p>

Most sex crimes, including voyeurism, are committed by men, while the victims are usually women and children (see Department of Justice, <i>Voyeurism as a Criminal Offence: A Consultation Paper</i> (2002), at p. 4; <i>R. v. Friesen</i>, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 65, citing <i>R. v. George</i>, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 2; J.

The new voyeurism offence “was motivated by concerns about the potential for rapidly evolving technology to be abused for the secret viewing or recording of individuals for sexual purposes and in ways that involve a serious breach of privacy” (para. 49, citing Department of Justice, at p. 1). Voyeurism is thus <i>both</i> a sexual and a privacy-based offence. Section 162(1) is intended to deal with both these related harms: behaviour that violates sexual integrity, and behaviour that breaches privacy (paras.&nbsp;51-52). Rowe J., concurring in the result in <i>Jarvis</i>, agreed with Wagner C.J. that the purpose and object of s. 162(1) is “to protect well-established interests of privacy, autonomy and sexual integrity of all individuals, in light of threats posed by new technologies to encroach upon them” (para.&nbsp;113).</p>

(a), (b), or (c) applies. In <i>Jarvis</i>, Wagner C.J. explained that the circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy under s. 162(1) are “circumstances in which a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred” (para. 28). A court should consider the entire context in which the observation or recording occurred, including the following non-exhaustive factors: (1) the location of the person when they were observed or recorded; (2) the nature of the impugned conduct (i.e., whether it consisted of observation or recording); (3) the awareness or consent of the person who was observed or recorded; (4) the manner in which the observation or recording was made; (5) the subject matter or content of the observation or recording; (6) any rules, regulations, or policies that governed the observation or recording; (7) the relationship between the parties; (8) the purpose for which the observation or recording was made; and (9) the personal attributes of the person who was observed or recorded (paras.&nbsp;5 and 28-29).</p>

I agree with the observations of Juriansz J.A. in <i>R. v. Trinchi</i>, 2019 ONCA 356, 145 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 8, that para. (a) “does not require the person to be actually nude, exposing intimate parts of his or her body, or engaged in sexual activity”; it suffices if they are in a place where a person may “reasonably be expected to be in such a state, such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom” (see also <i>Jarvis</i>, at para. 46, per Wagner C.J.; M. Manning and P.&nbsp;Sankoff,&nbsp;<i>Manning, Mewett &amp; Sankoff: Criminal Law</i>&nbsp;(5th ed. 2015), at ¶21.245). I also agree that, unlike para. (c), para. (a) “does not require the accused to act for a sexual purpose. It would apply to an accused who hoped to profit by posting recordings on the Internet” (<i>Trinchi</i>, at para. 8; see also <i>Jarvis</i>, at para. 32, per Wagner&nbsp;C.J., and at paras. 143-44, per Rowe&nbsp;J.).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par33" class="">33</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 162(1)(b) protects the sexual integrity of persons engaged in <i>specific activities</i>: when “the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity”. I again agree with Juriansz J.A. that, under para.&nbsp;(b), the “nature of the location does not matter, but the accused must have the purpose of observing or recording the subject in such a state or engaged in such an activity” (<i>Trinchi</i>, at para. 9; see also <i>Jarvis</i>, at paras. 46-47 and 52, per Wagner C.J.). In addition, the Crown need not prove that the accused acted for a sexual purpose: “[p]aragraph (<i>b</i>), like para. (<i>a</i>), would apply to an accused whose purpose was commercial” (<i>Trinchi</i>, at para. 9; see also <i>Jarvis</i>, at para. 32, per Wagner C.J., and at para. 143, per Rowe J.).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par34" class="">34</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 162(1)(c) protects the sexual integrity of persons when the observation or recording is done for a <i>sexual purpose</i>. This provision applies “whether the subject is clothed or unclothed — no matter what she or he is doing” (<i>Trinchi</i>, at para. 10). In <i>Jarvis</i>, for example, the accused teacher was convicted under s. 162(1)(c), even though the students surreptitiously video recorded were fully clothed and going about common school activities. Paragraph (c) applies regardless of the location of the targeted subject (<i>Jarvis</i>, at paras. 46-47 and 52, per Wagner C.J., and at para. 129, per Rowe&nbsp;J.).</p>

(a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) also protect privacy. Parliament’s two objectives of protecting against the related harms of violations of sexual integrity and privacy appear throughout s. 162(1). For example, in considering whether a person “is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy” in the opening words of s. 162(1), a court must consider whether a person “would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred”, based on the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in <i>Jarvis</i> (paras. 5 and 28-29). These considerations include factors relating to sexual integrity, such as whether the subject matter of the observation or recording includes intimate parts of a person’s body (para. 29(5)), and whether the recording is for a sexual purpose (paras. 29(8) and 31-32). Similarly, paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) protect privacy from surreptitious observations or recordings in circumstances where sexual integrity is engaged.</p>

The Crown says that it is sufficient for it to prove that the “place” where a surreptitious recording was made is one in which nudity could reasonably be expected to occur at any time. Section 162(1)(a) thus protects the privacy of persons in certain “places”, whether or not nudity is expected at the time of the alleged offence. The Crown claims that there is ample evidence to support the trial judge’s conclusion that “the hockey dressing rooms, in which Mr. Downes took the photographs of T.R. and G.C., are places in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude” (A.F., at para.&nbsp;95, quoting trial reasons, at para.&nbsp;228 (CanLII)).</p>

He claims that a temporal component ensures that the voyeurism offence maintains its purpose of prohibiting breaches of sexual privacy. In his view, s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) should be interpreted in light of the harms contemplated in the scheme for sexual offences in Part V of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, and is breached only when the person is recorded in a way that infringes their sexual integrity. He claims that an actual infringement of sexual integrity is needed; a risk of infringement is insufficient. Mr.&nbsp;Downes notes that none of the photos at issue depicted nudity or was pornographic. He claims that since none of the boys in his photos was nude and there was no reasonable expectation at the time the photos were taken that anybody would be nude, it cannot be inferred that he intended to take a nude or otherwise prohibited voyeuristic photo.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par41" class="">41</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test in s. 162(1)(a) for the “place” is objective in two respects. First, s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) uses the definite article “<i>the</i> person” (“<i>la personne</i>”) when referring to the subject of the observation or recording, but uses the indefinite article “<i>a</i> person” (“<i>une personne</i>”) when referring to the reasonably expected uses of the place. This means that <i>the</i> person being surreptitiously observed or recorded must be in a place in which <i>a</i> person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Second, s. 162(1)(a) asks whether a person can “reasonably” be expected to be nude in the place, and not whether the accused subjectively expected them to be nude. The use of an objective test in s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) is not determinative of whether the provision contains a temporal component, however, because Parliament still might have intended that the objective evaluation be made at a specific time.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par42" class="">42</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key textual point is the lack of express language in s. 162(1)(a) suggesting that Parliament intended the “place” to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Had Parliament intended to insist on such a temporal component, it could have done so expressly. For example, an adjacent provision, s.&nbsp;162.1(1) — the offence of publishing an intimate image without consent — contains two express temporal components. An “intimate image” is defined under s.&nbsp;162.1(2) as a visual recording of a person made by any means, “(a) in which the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts or is engaged in explicit sexual activity; (b) in respect of which, <u>at the time of the recording</u>, there were circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy; and (c) in respect of which the person depicted retains a reasonable expectation of privacy <u>at the time the offence is committed</u>”. Section 162(1)(a) contains no such temporal language. Had Parliament intended s. 162(1)(a) to contain a temporal component, it could easily have referred to the observation or recording being made in “a place in which a person can <i>then</i> reasonably be expected to be” nude, or being made in a place in which a person would reasonably be expected to be nude “<i>at the time of the observation or recording</i>” (see C.A. reasons, at para.&nbsp;77, per Dickson J.A. (emphasis in original)). But Parliament chose not to do so.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par43" class="">43</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, while not determinative, the lack of express temporal language in s.&nbsp;162(1)(a)’s objective test for the “place” suggests that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component.</p>

Interpreting s.&nbsp;162(1)(a) as prohibiting surreptitious observation or recording of persons in specific places without a temporal component promotes Parliament’s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity, especially for children and other vulnerable persons. Interpreting s. 162(1)(a) with a temporal component detracts from these purposes and leads to arbitrary and absurd results.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par45" class="">45</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament’s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as a location-based offence without a temporal component. As noted by the intervener, the Attorney General of Ontario, rather than providing a specific list of places protected under s. 162(1)(a), Parliament chose to define the protected places in a principled and normative way: “If it is reasonable to expect that people in a certain place will be naked, or expose their genitals or anal region or breasts, or be engaged in explicit sexual activity, then that is a place where everyone is entitled to be free from surreptitious observation and visual recording — whether naked or not, exposed or not, explicit sexual activity or not” (I.F., at para. 18). Thus, when a person is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, s. 162(1)(a) stipulates a rule that normatively identifies a class of quintessentially “safe places”, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms, in which people should be entitled to not be non-consensually observed or visually recorded, whether or not they or another person in the place are reasonably expected to be nude <i>at the time</i> of the observation or recording. In this way, s. 162(1)(a) protects both privacy and sexual integrity.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par46" class="">46</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is worth elaborating on how prohibiting voyeurism in such “safe places” under s. 162(1)(a), whether or not nudity is reasonably expected at the time of the surreptitious observation or recording, protects sexual integrity as it is understood today. As noted in this Court’s decisions in <i>Friesen</i> and <i>Jarvis</i>, society’s conception of sexual offences has evolved from a focus on the wrongful interference with sexual propriety to a concern with protecting sexual integrity (<i>Friesen</i>, at para. 55, and <i>Jarvis</i>, at para. 127, per Rowe J., both citing E. Craig, <i>Troubling Sex: Towards a Legal Theory of Sexual Integrity</i> (2012), at p. 68). In the passage cited approvingly in <i>Friesen</i> and the concurring reasons in <i>Jarvis</i>, Professor Elaine Craig explained that “[t]his shift from focusing on sexual propriety to sexual integrity enables greater emphasis on violations of trust, humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, and loss of self-esteem rather than simply, or only, on deprivations of honour, chastity, or bodily integrity (as was more the case when the law’s concern had a greater focus on sexual propriety)” (p. 68). Under a sexual integrity analysis, the focus is “not simply [on] the sexual motives, arousal, or body parts of the accused, or the community’s standard of sexual propriety, but also [on] the perception, experience, and impact on the complainant” (p. 75). In addition, a sexual integrity analysis focuses not just on physical harm to the complainant, but also on emotional and psychological harm, which is often more lasting than physical harm, especially for children (<i>Friesen</i>, at paras. 56-59).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par47" class="">47</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Surreptitious observation or recording of a person where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and which occurs in a “safe place” under s.&nbsp;162(1)(a), violates or poses a risk of violating sexual integrity, even if nudity is not reasonably expected at the specific time of the observation or recording. An observation or recording in such a quintessentially private and “safe place” violates trust and can result in the person’s humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, or loss of self‑esteem (Craig, at p. 68). It can also cause emotional and psychological harm, even if the person is not observed or recorded when nude. As the intervener, the Samuelson‑Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, observes: “Such violations of trust objectify those targeted by reducing them to body parts, creating images that in a digital environment can be easily replicated, cropped and manipulated in ways and for uses that disregard their right to control their own bodies. These violating images hinder subjects from developing their sexuality as they see fit, while also potentially exposing them to the shame and humiliation that often results from instantaneous and widespread dissemination” (I.F., at para. 24).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par48" class="">48</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The emotional and psychological harms caused by violations of sexual integrity, even from non-nude photographs, are illustrated in this case. The sentencing judge noted the statement of T.R.’s mother that “when she told T.R. about the photographs, he was disappointed as he had considered Mr. Downes one of his more positive coaches. She said T.R.’s trust was broken and, as a result, T.R. is more cautious and less trusting of coaches and people in general” (2020 BCSC 177, at para.&nbsp;18 (CanLII)). As Dickson J.A. noted aptly, “[t]he potentially traumatic impact for adolescent boys of being photographed surreptitiously in such a manifestly private place is obvious” (para.&nbsp;97).</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par50" class="">50</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By contrast, interpreting s. 162(1)(a) with a temporal component detracts from Parliament’s purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity. On such an interpretation, surreptitious photos of children in their underwear in inherently private places would be permitted without criminal sanction simply because the children in those places were too self-conscious to undress (such as boys around the age of puberty) (see trial reasons, at para. 220). Such an interpretation would fail to protect the privacy and sexual integrity of some of the most vulnerable persons in our society — persons whom Parliament sought to protect through the voyeurism offence.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par51" class="">51</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relatedly, the Crown argues that such an interpretation of s. 162(1)(a) would result in arbitrary and absurd results: groups of children who are too self‑conscious about their bodies to shower or be nude in dressing rooms could be photographed surreptitiously, but children who are just a few years older and less self‑conscious — and who thus might shower or be nude — could not be photographed. I agree with the Crown that Parliament could not have intended such arbitrary and absurd results (see <i>Rizzo</i>, at para. 27). Parliament could not have intended that persons who ordinarily choose to disrobe in a place where nudity can reasonably be expected are protected from voyeurism, while persons who ordinarily choose to keep their clothes on are not.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par52" class="">52</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded otherwise by taking a narrow perspective that views sexual offences as concerned with sexual propriety alone rather than also with sexual integrity. The majority ruled that an implicit temporal component is essential for s. 162(1)(a) to fulfill its purpose as a sexual offence, rather than as an offence protecting privacy alone. In its view, reading s. 162(1)(a) as criminalizing surreptitious observation or recording when nudity is not reasonably expected at the time of the observation or recording would “capture conduct that does not bear any of the hallmarks of voyeurism <i>as a breach of sexual privacy</i>” (para.&nbsp;41 (emphasis in original)). The majority declared that the voyeurism offence in s.&nbsp;162(1) “[is] fundamentally concerned with bodily and sexual privacy” and “[is] not intended to establish [an] offenc[e] founded upon an invasion of privacy alone” (para. 54). It stated that while Mr. Downes’ conduct was “undoubtedly a breach of trust and invasive of privacy, that does not necessarily make it conduct that this section criminalizes as a sexual offence” (para. 54).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par53" class="">53</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. The majority’s reasoning assumes that in order to stigmatize conduct as a violation of sexual integrity, and thus as a sexual offence, there must be a risk of capturing nude images at the relevant time. But, as I have explained above, taking surreptitious photographs of children in their underwear in an inherently “safe place” like a hockey dressing room violates not only the children’s privacy but also their sexual integrity, even if nudity was not reasonably expected when the photos were taken. Taking surreptitious photos in such an inherently “safe place” may injure many interests associated with sexual integrity: such conduct violates trust and can result in the humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, and loss of self-esteem of the targeted individuals. Such photos can injure a person’s sexual integrity by reducing them to body parts, by hindering them from developing their sexuality as they see fit, and by creating a risk of widespread dissemination of the photos to strangers. When viewed through the lens of Parliament’s purpose of protecting sexual integrity rather than simply sexual propriety, Mr. Downes’ conduct violated both the children’s privacy and their sexual integrity. He thus engaged in conduct that Parliament has criminalized as a sexual offence.</p>

As a result, the trial judge appropriately convicted Mr. Downes of two counts of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a).</p>

He states that the objective of s. 162(1) is to target exploitative sexual conduct and says that the lack of a temporal component “extends the offence to cover conduct bearing no connection to its underlying purpose of preventing sexual exploitation” (R.F., at para. 68). Mr. Downes did not raise this constitutional issue at trial, and although he raised it at the Court of Appeal, the court did not address it.</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par56" class="">56</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a serious question as to whether Mr. Downes can challenge the constitutionality of s. 162(1)(a) in this Crown appeal as of right under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec693subsec1" target="_blank">s. 693(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(a) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. Such an appeal is limited to the question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, which in this case was whether <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec162subsec1" target="_blank">s. 162(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(a) has an implicit temporal component. Although in a Crown appeal as of right the respondent can raise “any argument which supports the order of the court below” (<i>R. v. Keegstra</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 381, at para. 23), Mr. Downes’ overbreadth argument does not support the Court of Appeal’s order: if accepted, it would likely result not in a new trial but in no trial, since <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec162subsec1" target="_blank">s. 162(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(a) would be unconstitutional (para. 36). Thus, ordinarily Mr.&nbsp;Downes could not challenge the constitutionality of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec162subsec1" target="_blank">s. 162(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(a) without first obtaining leave to cross-appeal on this issue under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-s-26-en#!fragment/sec40" target="_blank">s. 40<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-s-26-en" target="_blank">Supreme Court Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-s-26-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

As noted in <i>Guindon v. Canada</i>, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 20, “[w]hether to hear and decide a constitutional issue when it has not been properly raised in the courts below is a matter for the Court’s discretion, taking into account all of the circumstances, including the state of the record, fairness to all parties, the importance of having the issue resolved by this Court, its suitability for decision and the broader interests of the administration of justice.” The test is a stringent one: this Court must be satisfied that hearing and deciding the new constitutional issue causes no prejudice to the parties (paras. 22-23).</p> 
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[<a name="par58" class="">58</a>]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, deciding whether s. 162(1)(a) is unconstitutionally overbroad would prejudice the Crown and would require the Court to address an important <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> issue in a factual vacuum. Because the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> issue was not raised at trial, the Crown has filed no evidence on whether any infringement of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> could be justified under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec1" target="_blank">s. 1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>. As noted in <i>Guindon</i>, “[a] respondent, like any other party, cannot rely upon an entirely new argument that would have required additional evidence to be adduced at trial” (para. 32 (citations omitted in original), quoting <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 58). This is especially so in constitutional cases. This Court has often stressed the importance of a full evidentiary record when deciding constitutional questions and has cautioned that “<i>Charter</i> decisions should not and must not be made in a factual vacuum” (<i>MacKay v. Manitoba</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at p. 361; <i>Guindon</i>, at para. 116, per Abella and Wagner JJ.). As the Court of Appeal for Ontario has stated, “[a]rguing the interpretation of a statute is much different than arguing its constitutional validity” (<i>R. v. Wookey</i>, 2016 ONCA 611, 363 C.R.R. (2d) 177, at para. 61, per Tulloch&nbsp;J.A. (now C.J.O.)). As a result, in all the circumstances, I would decline to decide the constitutional issue.</p>
