He started ransacking the house, found a .32 calibre pistol, loaded it with ammunition and placed it in his belt. Later, he gathered together everything he had stolen and placed it by the back door. When the victim returned home for lunch, the accused was still in the house. The victim saw his slain dog and turned back towards the bathroom, where the accused was hiding.&nbsp; The accused came out of the tub and fired the gun.&nbsp; Eight bullets entered the victim's body.&nbsp; Only one was in the area of the legs; the rest were in the torso and neck.&nbsp; After the shooting, the accused took the victim's money and his car keys, placed the stolen goods in the victim's car and drove away.&nbsp; The accused was arrested three days later.&nbsp; In his statement to the police, he stated that he had gone to the victim's house to break in and admitted that he had stolen money from the victim and from the residence.&nbsp; At trial, however, he testified that he had gone there only to ask a favour from the victim.&nbsp; He had then entered the house because of the heavy rain and, once inside, had decided to steal.&nbsp; He also testified that he had aimed the gun at the victim's legs and that he had not intended to kill him but was only trying to escape.&nbsp; In cross‑examination, the accused testified that the money which was found in his possession when he was arrested came in part from his welfare allowance.&nbsp; The Crown was allowed to adduce rebuttal evidence on this issue and two welfare workers testified that the accused had never received social assistance, and that his applications for welfare had been refused.&nbsp; In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to kill the victim and that the killing was planned and deliberate, they should find him guilty of first degree murder.&nbsp; The trial judge explained that the expression "planned and deliberate" meant a "carefully thought out design which precedes the carrying out of an unlawful act.&nbsp; It is the commission of an unlawful act after having thought about it.&nbsp; In other words, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is a planned and desired act".&nbsp; The trial judge also instructed the jury on second degree murder but not on manslaughter.&nbsp; The accused was convicted of first degree murder and the majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction.&nbsp; This appeal raised three issues:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;whether the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to adduce rebuttal evidence; (2)&nbsp;whether the trial judge adequately charged the jury on the "planned and deliberate" nature of first degree murder; and (3)&nbsp;whether the trial judge should have instructed the jury that manslaughter was an alternative verdict.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> La&nbsp;Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and Cory&nbsp;JJ.:&nbsp; The crucial question with regard to the admission of rebuttal evidence is not whether the evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce is determinative of an essential issue, but rather whether it is related to an essential issue which may be determinative of the case.&nbsp; If the rebuttal evidence goes to an essential element of the case and the Crown could not have foreseen that such evidence would be necessary, then it is generally admissible.&nbsp; Thus, if a statement is made during the course of a witness's testimony at trial which conflicts with other evidence relating to an essential issue in the case, rebuttal evidence will be permitted to resolve the conflict.&nbsp; Here, the rebuttal evidence was admissible.&nbsp; The evidence of the welfare workers goes to an integral element of the case and the Crown could not have foreseen that the accused would testify as he did in light of his earlier statement.&nbsp; The bald admission of the robbery in the course of evidence, which falsely coloured its nature and changed important details, cannot result in a finding that the rebuttal evidence thereby goes solely to collateral issues.&nbsp; Evidence as to the details of the robbery formed an integral part of the Crown's case and it was important that any confusion with regard to the accused's statement and testimony on this essential issue be clarified.&nbsp; This could only be done by way of reply.&nbsp; It cannot then be said that the rebuttal evidence constituted a splitting of the Crown's case.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the charge is read as a whole, it is apparent that the jury was properly instructed on the issue of planning and deliberation.&nbsp; The trial judge's directions were quite clear that these concepts were two distinct elements of the crime of first degree murder, both of which had to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to adduce the rebuttal evidence.&nbsp; The rebuttal evidence was not relevant to the accused's assertion that he did not intend to kill the victim, and it was wholly unnecessary to prove the robbery, as this had been admitted by the accused's own testimony.&nbsp; While the Crown had the right to cross‑examine the accused on collateral facts, in order to attack his credibility, having done so the Crown had to take the accused's answers.&nbsp; Put in context, the rebuttal evidence attacked the accused's credibility on the sole question of whether he was a recipient of social assistance, a collateral issue which was raised for the first time in cross‑examination.&nbsp; The Crown also argued that the accused made his credibility a central issue by giving testimony which differed from his police statement.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the dog silenced, the appellant started ransacking the house.&nbsp; He went first to the master bedroom and searched the drawers of the night tables and dressers by emptying their contents onto the floor.&nbsp; He found a .32 calibre pistol which was not loaded.&nbsp; He then located the clip for the pistol with two bullets in it.&nbsp; He continued to look for more ammunition for the pistol and finally shot the lock off a chest in the basement where he found the ammunition.&nbsp; In his statement to the police, Aalders said that he loaded the .32&nbsp;pistol because it was not as heavy and cumbersome as the 30.30 rifle.&nbsp; He placed the loaded pistol in his belt before running back upstairs.&nbsp; He did this he said, in case anyone should come into the house as he did not want to get caught.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">However, an exception to this rule is made when the defence has raised some new matter or a defence which the Crown has had no opportunity to deal with in presenting its case and which the Crown could not reasonably have anticipated.&nbsp; McIntyre J. expressed the following caveat to the exception on p. 474:</span></p>
