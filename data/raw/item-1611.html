24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> McLachlin and Major JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; The test for a directed verdict in Canada remains whether a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Where it is necessary to engage in a limited evaluation of inferences in order to answer this question, as in cases based on circumstantial evidence, trial judges may do so; indeed, they cannot do otherwise in order to discharge their obligation of determining whether the Crown has established a case that calls on the accused to answer or risk being convicted.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The Crown must adduce sufficient evidence on the issues of identity, causation, the death of the victim and the requisite mental state to pass the hurdle of a motion for a directed acquittal.&nbsp; “Sufficient evidence” must mean sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; merely to refer to “sufficient evidence” is incomplete since “sufficient” always relates to the goal or threshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In addition, a relationship exists between the elements of identity, causation, the death of victim and requisite mental state.&nbsp; “Identity” means “identity of the murderer”.&nbsp; Similarly, the element of mental state presupposes a culpable homicide.&nbsp; The finding that there has been a homicide or culpable cause of death is critical, therefore, in order to speak of identity or mental state.&nbsp; The evidence here was not capable of supporting an inference, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the death was wrongful.&nbsp; The evidence, taken as a whole, was not capable of supporting the conclusion that the accused was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in allowing the motion for a directed verdict.</span></p>

Comba</i>, [1938] S.C.R. 396, at p. 397, it was suggested that where the Crown’s case rests on circumstantial evidence, the trial judge can himself apply the rule in <i>Hodge’s Case</i> (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, (<u>i.e.,&nbsp;that to convict on circumstantial evidence, the evidence must not permit any other rational conclusion but that the accused is guilty</u>) and direct a verdict.&nbsp; Any confusion on this point was cleared up by this Court’s unanimous judgment (McIntyre J. writing for Dickson C.J. and Estey, Lamer (as he then was), Wilson, Le&nbsp;Dain, and La&nbsp;Forest JJ.) in <i>Monteleone</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 161:</p>

24.4pt">Where there is before the court any admissible evidence, <u>whether direct or circumstantial</u>, which, if believed by a properly charged jury acting reasonably, would justify a conviction, the trial judge is not justified in directing a verdict of acquittal.&nbsp; It is not the function of the trial judge to weigh the evidence, to test its quality or reliability once a determination of its admissibility has been made.&nbsp; It is not for the trial judge to draw inferences of fact from the evidence before him.&nbsp; These functions are for the trier of fact, the jury.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Where the evidence is purely circumstantial, this Court made it quite clear, at p. 161, that the issue of whether the standard set in <i>Hodge’s Case</i> has been met is a matter for the jury, and not the judge:&nbsp; “<u>The question of whether circumstantial evidence meets the requirement of the so-called rule in <i>Hodge’s Case</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is for the jury to determine</u>.&nbsp; This was settled in <i>Mezzo</i> [<i>Mezzo v. The Queen</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802]” (emphasis added).&nbsp; In other words, whether or not there is a rational explanation for that evidence other than the guilt of the accused, is a question for the jury.&nbsp; To my mind, this view is dispositive of this case and the Court need go no further than to rely on this authority.</p>

19.95pt;line-height:24.4pt">Turning now to the case at bar, the appellant does not&nbsp;dispute the validity of the <i>Shephard</i> test.&nbsp; As I understand <u>the&nbsp;principal argument advanced for the appellant, it is that there&nbsp;was no evidence as to the cause of the fire</u>.&nbsp; It is asserted&nbsp;that the evidence of fire inspector McLean does not afford the&nbsp;basis for any finding that the fire was of an incendiary&nbsp;origin.&nbsp; The most that can be made of it is that the cause of&nbsp;the fire is unexplained.&nbsp; This proposition is vital to the&nbsp;appellant's argument and, in his view, is decisive.&nbsp; <u>If there is&nbsp;no evidence of an incendiary origin for the fire, there is no&nbsp;evidence of the commission of a crime</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">I pause here to emphasize again that, as in <i>Charemski</i>, the “gap” in the evidence of the Crown on which the defendant is focusing relates to the causation of the harm.&nbsp; McIntyre J. squarely addresses this contention, first quoting Lacourcière J.A. ((1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 489, at p. 493) at pp. 162-63:</p>

In the case of circumstantial evidence, the issue is the reasonableness of the inference the Crown seeks to have drawn.&nbsp; As stated by Professor Delisle, in “Tests for Sufficiency of Evidence”, <i>supra</i>, at p. 392, “[i]t is in evaluating the rationality of the necessary derivative inference, in testing its legitimacy, that the judge, either at preliminary, at trial or on appeal, performs the necessary weighing function”.&nbsp; But weighing the evidence for this purpose is a very limited exercise.&nbsp; The judge does not ask him- or herself whether he or she is personally satisfied by the evidence.&nbsp; Rather, the judge asks whether a jury, acting reasonably, <u>could</u> be satisfied by the evidence.&nbsp; Nor is the judge permitted to assess the credibility of the witnesses: see <i>Mezzo</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; It is for the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses, to decide what evidence it accepts and what evidence it rejects, and ultimately, to determine if the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The difference between the judge’s function on a motion for a directed verdict and the jury’s function at the end of the trial is simply this:&nbsp; the judge assesses whether, hypothetically, a guilty verdict is possible; the jury determines whether guilt has actually been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

Comba</i>, [1938] S.C.R. 396, McIntyre J. stated, at p. 843, that “circumstantial evidence, which did not comply with the rule in <i>Hodge’s Case</i>, [was] no evidence at all going to show guilt”.&nbsp; In other words, if the circumstantial evidence presented does not reasonably support the inference of guilt, it is “no evidence” — the evidence is insufficient.&nbsp; McIntyre J. is necessarily acknowledging that the trial judge must evaluate, or weigh, whether circumstantial evidence is sufficient to, or capable of, supporting a verdict of guilt.&nbsp; This suggests that he viewed the trial judge in <i>Comba</i> as acting correctly when he weighed the evidence to determine whether the inferences necessary were <u>capable of meeting</u> the test in <i>Hodge’s Case</i> (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136.&nbsp; The question of whether the test in <i>Hodge’s Case</i> was actually met was for the jury. Wilson J. held the same view at p. 813:&nbsp; “in this context ‘no evidence’ is not to be taken literally as meaning a total absence of any evidence but as meaning rather no evidence capable of supporting a conviction”.</p>

12.2pt">Where there is before the court any admissible evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, which, if believed by a properly charged jury acting reasonably, would justify a conviction, the trial judge is not justified in directing a verdict of acquittal.&nbsp; It is not the function of the trial judge to weigh the evidence, to test its quality or reliability once a determination of its admissibility has been made.&nbsp; It is not for the trial judge to draw inferences of fact from the evidence before him.&nbsp; These functions are for the trier of fact, the jury.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Here again one finds the implicit contradiction.&nbsp; The first sentence in the passage is a correct statement of the classic rule.&nbsp; It implies that the judge may be required to engage in limited weighing or evaluation of the inferences to be drawn from circumstantial evidence, since, as discussed above, this is an essential step in determining whether the evidence is rationally capable of supporting a conviction.&nbsp; Yet having acknowledged this, McIntyre J. goes on to suggest that the trial judge cannot draw inferences of fact from the evidence before him, and later states, at p. 161, that “[t]he question of whether circumstantial evidence meets the requirement of the so-called rule in <i>Hodge’s Case</i> . . . is for the jury to determine.&nbsp; This was settled in <i>Mezzo. . . .</i>”&nbsp; This contradiction was left unresolved.</p>

McWilliams, <i>Canadian Criminal Evidence</i> (3rd ed. 1988) loose-leaf)), at p. 17-3:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">Murder can still be proved by circumstantial evidence <u>but the necessity of the most compelling proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i> is obvious.</u> But as <i>Wills</i> said at p. 370:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">No universal and invariable rule ... can be laid down; and every case must depend upon its particular circumstances; and the <i>corpus delicti</i> must, like anything else, be proved by the best evidence reasonably capable of being adduced, and by such an amount and combination of relevant facts, whether direct or circumstantial, as to establish the <i>factum probandum</i> to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:58.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Therefore, Flinn J. was correct to place special emphasis on the absence of any evidence that the deceased had died as a result of a crime.</p>

Third, it seems that in <i>Monteleone</i> there was no other rational explanation for the fire; the fire marshall testified to this effect.&nbsp; The pathologists in the case at bar, on the contrary, testified to the reasonable possibility of other non-criminal causes of death.</p>
