 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the residual category is invoked, the first stage of the test is met when it is established that the state has engaged in conduct that is offensive to societal notions of fair play and decency, and that proceeding with a trial in the face of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of the justice system. &nbsp;At the second stage of the test, the focus is on whether an alternate remedy short of a stay of proceedings will adequately dissociate the justice system from the impugned state conduct going forward.&nbsp; Finally, the court must decide whether staying the proceedings or having a trial despite the impugned conduct better protects the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; This inquiry necessarily demands balancing. &nbsp;The court must consider such things as the nature and seriousness of the impugned conduct, whether the conduct is isolated or reflects a systemic and ongoing problem, the circumstances of the accused, the charges he or she faces, and the interests of society in having the charges disposed of on the merits.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the instant case, the three forms of state misconduct that are at issue fall squarely within the residual category.&nbsp; The trial judge erred in his assessment of the impugned misconduct and in concluding that a stay of proceedings was warranted.&nbsp; As regards the medical records, the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in finding that the Crown’s conduct occasioned prejudice to the integrity of the justice system. &nbsp;With respect to the police collusion, apart from its limited extent, the trial judge failed to consider the existence of another remedy that would have overcome the threat posed to the integrity of the justice system — namely, excluding the firearm from evidence in respect of both accused.&nbsp; As for the threats made by the Crown, while they were reprehensible and should not be repeated, the trial judge failed to consider that they were made more than a year before the trial began, and that the accused took no steps for over a year to address the Crown’s conduct.&nbsp; These factors shed light on how seriously the accused took the threats.&nbsp; The trial judge also failed to consider that the Crown prosecutor who made the threats was removed from the case months before the trial started.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial judge failed to balance the need for a stay against society’s interest in a trial on the merits. &nbsp;When the impugned misconduct is weighed against society’s interest in a trial, this is not one of the clearest of cases where the exceptional remedy of a stay of proceedings is warranted.</p>

(dissenting): &nbsp;A stay of proceedings may be imposed when the state conduct is so profoundly and disproportionately inconsistent with the public perception of what a fair justice system requires, that proceeding with a trial means condoning unforgiveable conduct.&nbsp; A Crown who makes threats intended to bully an accused into foregoing his or her right to a trial, takes fatal aim at the heart of the public’s confidence in that integrity.</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unjustifiable nature of the Crown’s conduct in this case was not mitigated by the length of time between the threats and the trial. &nbsp;Time is not a legal remedy for a fundamental breach of the Crown’s role and the passage of time does not attenuate her unpardonable conduct.&nbsp; It was the mere fact that the threats were made at all that was key, not when they were made.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:24.0pt;margin-left:0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, a further balancing exercise was not required in the circumstances. &nbsp;The trial judge was unequivocal in concluding that the conduct justified a stay, and there was none of the uncertainty as to the propriety of a stay that is a condition precedent to the need for a balancing exercise. &nbsp;When a trial judge has found that the conduct cannot be condoned because it is such an exceptional assault on the public’s sense of justice, it is conceptually inconsistent to ask the court to undermine its own conclusion by re-weighing the half of the scale that contains the public’s interest in trials on the merits. &nbsp;The public has an interest not only in trials on the merits, it has an even greater interest in knowing that when the state is involved in proceedings, particularly those that can result in an individual’s loss of liberty, it will put fairness above expedience.&nbsp; Justice is not only about results, it is about how those results are obtained.&nbsp; When a Crown threatens an accused with additional offences if he or she does not plead guilty, the public’s interest in the results of a trial must yield to the transcendent interest in protecting the public’s confidence in the integrity of the justice system.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we shall see, the appellants, Antal Babos and Sergio Piccirilli, complain about three forms of state misconduct:</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notably, the appellants do not argue that they cannot receive a fair trial as a result of the alleged incidents of misconduct — they accept that they can.&nbsp; They submit instead that this is one of the clearest of cases in which a stay of proceedings is necessary to preserve and protect the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; Anything short of that would amount to judicial condonation of egregious misconduct and erode the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And that, the appellants say, is the basis upon which the trial judge ordered a stay of proceedings in their case.&nbsp; In doing so, he made no error.&nbsp; His decision was discretionary and entitled to deference, and the Quebec Court of Appeal should not have interfered.&nbsp; Hence, the appellants seek to have the order of the trial judge reinstated.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would not give effect to the appellants’ submissions.&nbsp; In my respectful view, the trial judge committed errors in assessing all three forms of state misconduct.&nbsp; As regards Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records, he made a palpable and overriding error in assessing the Crown’s conduct.&nbsp; With respect to the police collusion, apart from its limited extent, the trial judge failed to consider that excluding the firearm found in Mr. Babos’s trunk would have overcome whatever threat it posed to the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; As for the threats by the provincial Crown, while they were reprehensible and should not be repeated, the trial judge overstated their seriousness and failed to balance the need for a stay against society’s interest in a trial on the merits.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the impugned misconduct is properly considered and the correct legal framework is applied, a stay is unwarranted.&nbsp; Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeals.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 21, 2006, Mr. Piccirilli was arrested.&nbsp; Both he and Mr. Babos were ultimately charged with numerous firearms related offences, as well as offences related to the importation, production and trafficking of methamphetamine.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The instances of threatening conduct by Crown counsel are said to have occurred between June 2006 and February 2007. Specifically, the provincial prosecutor assigned to the case, Ms. Valérie Tremblay, was accused of threatening Mr. Piccirilli on three separate occasions with additional charges if he did not plead guilty.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Mr. Patrice Duliot, Mr. Piccirilli’s former lawyer, Ms. Tremblay told him, in the presence of Mr. Piccirilli, that [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “if your client doesn’t settle, he’s gonna be hit by a train” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 5).&nbsp; Mr. Piccirilli claimed that on another occasion, either in June or September 2006, Ms. Tremblay threatened him personally in the courtroom.&nbsp; According to Mr. Piccirilli, she said “if you proceed, we’ll bring other charges against you” and that she would&nbsp; “use section 577” and go “straight to trial” (pp. 65 and 69).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; Another of Mr. Piccirilli’s counsel, Ms. Guylaine Tardif, deposed in an affidavit that in November 2006 or February 2007, Ms. Tremblay told her that Mr. Piccirilli would be charged with money laundering and organized crime offences if he did not plead guilty.&nbsp; Ms. Tremblay asked Ms. Tardif to relay this message to her client.&nbsp; Although Mr. Babos was not threatened directly, no issue is taken with the fact that the threats conveyed to Mr. Piccirilli would have come to his attention.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ trial began in April 2008.&nbsp; Notably, by February 2008, Ms. Tremblay was no longer on the file.&nbsp; She had been removed for health reasons and replaced by a federal prosecutor, Ms. Kovacevich, when the charges against the appellants were joined in a single indictment.&nbsp; It was at this juncture that the appellants were charged with four additional offences relating to organized crime, firearms and drug trafficking.&nbsp; The additional charges stemmed from evidence led at the appellants’ preliminary hearings.&nbsp; By this point, neither the appellants nor their counsel had mentioned the alleged threats made by Ms. Tremblay.&nbsp; Indeed, the threats did not surface until they were brought to the attention of the trial judge some six months into the trial and at least eighteen months after they were made.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of the trial, Mr. Babos alleged that the police had illegally searched the trunk of his car and he sought to have the firearm they seized excluded from evidence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec24subsec2" target="_blank">s. 24(2)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; On the s. 24(2) application, a key factual issue was whether Mr. Babos consented to the search and opened the trunk himself.&nbsp; Constables Brière and Sénéchal testified at the hearing.&nbsp; Cst. Brière testified that it was Mr. Babos who opened the trunk of the car.&nbsp; This testimony differed from the version of events he had given at the preliminary inquiry.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; When defence counsel confronted Cst. Brière with the change, Cst. Brière explained that he had spoken to Cst. Sénéchal while they were waiting to testify, and that Cst. Sénéchal had [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “convinced” him that the new version of events was the truth.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 2008, during the continuation of the trial, the Crown attempted to adduce the same firearm against Mr. Piccirilli.&nbsp; Mr. Piccirilli objected.&nbsp; The Crown took the position that Mr. Piccirilli had no standing to allege a violation of his<i> </i>s. 8 rights because the car from which the firearm was seized belonged to Mr. Babos.&nbsp; Again Cst. Brière testified, and again his evidence was somewhat different than before.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

Regan</i>, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297,<i> </i>at para. 53).&nbsp; It permanently halts the prosecution of an accused.&nbsp; In doing so, the truth-seeking function of the trial is frustrated and the public is deprived of the opportunity to see justice done on the merits.&nbsp; In many cases, alleged victims of crime are deprived of their day in court.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, this Court has recognized that there are rare occasions —the “clearest of cases” — when a stay of proceedings for an abuse of process will be warranted (<i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 68).&nbsp; These cases generally fall into two categories: (1) where state conduct compromises the fairness of an accused’s trial (the “main” category); and (2) where state conduct creates no threat to trial fairness but risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process (the “residual” category) (<i>O’Connor</i>, at para. 73).&nbsp; The impugned conduct in this case does not implicate the main category.&nbsp; Rather, it falls squarely within the latter category.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test used to determine whether a stay of proceedings is warranted is the same for both categories and consists of three requirements:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%">(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There must be prejudice to the accused’s right to a fair trial or the integrity of the justice system that “will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome” (<i>Regan</i>, at para. 54);</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%">(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where there is still uncertainty over whether a stay is warranted after steps (1) and (2), the court is required to balance the interests in favour of granting a stay, such as denouncing misconduct and preserving the integrity of the justice system, against “the interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits” (<i>ibid.</i>, at para. 57).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test is the same for both categories because concerns regarding trial fairness and the integrity of the justice system are often linked and regularly arise in the same case.&nbsp; Having one test for both categories creates a coherent framework that avoids “schizophrenia” in the law (<i>O’Connor</i>, at para. 71).&nbsp; But while the framework is the same for both categories, the test may — and often will — play out differently depending on whether the “main” or “residual” category is invoked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commencing with the first stage of the test, when the main category is invoked, the question is whether the accused’s right to a fair trial has been prejudiced and whether that prejudice will be carried forward through the conduct of the trial; in other words, the concern is whether there is <i>ongoing </i>unfairness to the accused.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[35]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By contrast, when the residual category is invoked, the question is whether the state has engaged in conduct that is offensive to societal notions of fair play and decency and whether proceeding with a trial in the face of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; To put it in simpler terms, there are limits on the type of conduct society will tolerate in the prosecution of offences.&nbsp; At times, state conduct will be so troublesome that having a trial — even a fair one — will leave the impression that the justice system condones conduct that offends society’s sense of fair play and decency.&nbsp; This harms the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; In these kinds of cases, the first stage of the test is met.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[36]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, this Court described the residual category in the following way: <i>&nbsp;</i></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">For a stay of proceedings to be appropriate in a case falling into the residual category, it must appear that the state misconduct is likely to continue in the future or that the carrying forward of the prosecution will offend society’s sense of justice.&nbsp; Ordinarily, the latter condition will not be met unless the former is as well — society will not take umbrage at the carrying forward of a prosecution unless it is likely that some form of misconduct will continue.&nbsp; There may be exceptional cases in which the past misconduct is so egregious that the mere fact of going forward in the light of it will be offensive.&nbsp; But such cases should be relatively very rare.&nbsp; [para. 91]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[37]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two points of interest arise from this description.&nbsp; First, while it is generally true that the residual category will be invoked as a result of state <i>misconduct</i>, this will not always be so.&nbsp; Circumstances may arise where the integrity of the justice system is implicated in the absence of misconduct.&nbsp; Repeatedly prosecuting an accused for the same offence after successive juries have been unable to reach a verdict stands as an example (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Keyowski</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657), as does using the criminal courts to collect a civil debt (see, e.g., <i>R. v. Waugh</i> (1985), 68 N.S.R. (2d) 247 (S.C., App. Div.)).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in a residual category case, regardless of the type of conduct complained of, the question to be answered at the first stage of the test is the same: whether proceeding in light of the impugned conduct would do further harm to the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; While I do not question the distinction between ongoing and past misconduct, it does not completely resolve the question of whether carrying on with a trial occasions further harm to the justice system.&nbsp; The court must still consider whether proceeding would lend judicial condonation to the impugned conduct.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[39]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the second stage of the test, the question is whether any other remedy short of a stay is capable of redressing the prejudice.&nbsp; Different remedies may apply depending on whether the prejudice relates to the accused’s right to a fair trial (the main category) or whether it relates to the integrity of the justice system (the residual category).&nbsp; Where the concern is trial fairness, the focus is on restoring an accused’s right to a fair trial.&nbsp; Here, procedural remedies, such as ordering a new trial, are more likely to address the prejudice of ongoing unfairness.&nbsp; Where the residual category is invoked, however, and the prejudice complained of is prejudice to the integrity of the justice system, remedies must be directed towards that harm.&nbsp; It must be remembered that for those cases which fall solely within the residual category, the goal is<i> not</i> to provide redress to an accused for a wrong that has been done to him or her in the past.&nbsp; Instead, the focus is on whether an alternate remedy short of a stay of proceedings will adequately dissociate the<i> </i>justice system from the impugned state conduct going forward.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[40]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the balancing of interests that occurs at the third stage of the test takes on added significance when the residual category is invoked.&nbsp; This Court has stated that the balancing need only be undertaken where there is still uncertainty as to whether a stay is appropriate after the first two parts of the test have been completed (<i>Tobiass</i>, at para. 92).&nbsp; When the main category is invoked, it will often be clear by the time the balancing stage has been reached that trial fairness has not been prejudiced or, if it has, that another remedy short of a stay is available to address the concern.&nbsp; In those cases, no balancing is required.&nbsp; In rare cases, it will be evident that state conduct has permanently prevented a fair trial from taking place.&nbsp; In these “clearest of cases”, the third and final balancing step will often add little to the inquiry, as society has no interest in unfair trials.</p>

Bellusci</i>, 2012 SCC 44, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, attests to the need for balancing when the conduct in question falls solely within the residual category.&nbsp; In <i>Bellusci</i>, the accused was assaulted in the back of a van by a prison guard while he was shackled and handcuffed.&nbsp; The accused was charged with assaulting the guard and intimidating a justice system participant.&nbsp; Fish J., writing for a unanimous Court, upheld the trial judge’s decision to issue a stay of proceedings for state misconduct falling in the residual category.&nbsp; In doing so, he noted that the trial judge had</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">appreciated the <u>need</u> to balance the competing interests at play in contemplating a stay of proceedings. He expressly took into account the difficult position of prison guards, the importance to the justice system of ensuring their protection, the seriousness of the charges against the accused, the integrity of the justice system, and the nature and gravity of the violation of Mr. Bellusci’s rights. Only then did he conclude that a stay was warranted.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 29.]&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC"><u>In some sense, an accused who is granted a stay under the residual category realizes a windfall.&nbsp; Thus, it is important to consider if the price of the stay of a charge against a particular accused is worth the gain.</u>&nbsp; Does the advantage of staying the charges against this accused outweigh the interest in having the case decided on the merits?&nbsp; <u>In answering that question, a court will almost inevitably have to engage in the type of balancing exercise that is referred to in the third criterion.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This balancing requires weighing the seriousness of the misconduct against the societal interest in having a trial.&nbsp; At this stage, the very serious nature of the charges facing the appellants — 22 charges concerning firearms, illegal drugs, and organized crime — looms large.&nbsp; Society has a profound interest in seeing justice done by having the guilt or innocence of the appellants determined through a full trial on the merits.&nbsp; When the impugned misconduct — threats uttered more than a year before trial by a Crown no longer on the case — is weighed against society’s interest in a trial, I am satisfied that this is not one of the “clearest of cases” where the exceptional remedy of a stay of proceedings is warranted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend that this case is analogous to <i>United States of America v. Cobb</i>, 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587, a case in which this Court upheld a stay of proceedings.&nbsp; In <i>Cobb</i>, the accused were facing extradition proceedings from Canada to the United States.&nbsp; They were granted a stay after the American prosecutor on the file hinted to the media that uncooperative fugitives would be subjected to rape in prison, and the judge presiding over their trial in the United States commented that uncooperative defendants would get the maximum jail sentence legally available.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[71]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case is a far cry from <i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Cobb</i>, the American prosecutor had threatened the accused with sexual violence.&nbsp; Here, the Crown threatened to charge the accused with additional offences if they did not plead guilty.&nbsp; While that was improper, the threats related to something she could have done legally under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec574subsec1" target="_blank">s. 574(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>b</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; Moreover, the decision to stay the proceedings in <i>Cobb </i>was motivated in large part by the fact that the prosecutor who made the threats remained in charge of the prosecutions.&nbsp; This Court noted that extraditing the accused would return them to an “ominous climate” in which the American prosecutor and judge would play a “large, if not decisive role” in determining their “ultimate fate” (<i>Cobb</i>, at para. 43).&nbsp; Here, Ms. Tremblay was off the case long before trial.&nbsp; In my view, <i>Cobb </i>provides little or no assistance to the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In deciding that a stay of proceedings is unwarranted in this case, I have assessed the three forms of alleged misconduct individually.&nbsp; The Crown’s conduct in securing Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records occasioned no prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; The harm caused by the finding of police collusion was curable through an alternate remedy: excluding the firearm from evidence against both appellants.&nbsp; And the Crown’s threatening conduct, while reprehensible, did not approximate the type of shocking conduct needed to justify a stay.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[73]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case lent itself to an individualistic approach.&nbsp; The three alleged instances of misconduct were separate and distinct, committed at different times by different players.&nbsp; There was no link between them.&nbsp; And in only one instance — the Crown’s threatening behaviour — was it necessary to consider the third stage of the test and balance the Crown’s misconduct against society’s interest in a trial on the merits.&nbsp; That said, I should not be taken as suggesting that an individualistic approach should always be followed.&nbsp; Indeed, a judge who is required to balance several instances of misconduct against the societal interest in a trial will almost certainly wish to consider the conduct cumulatively and in its full context.&nbsp; As well, there may be cases where the nature and number of incidents, though individually unworthy of a stay, will require one when considered together.&nbsp; But this is not such a case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[74]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeals.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="JudgeJuge">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-variant:normal !important">The following are the reasons delivered by</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[75]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Abella J. </span>(dissenting) — A stay should only be imposed in the clearest of cases, as Justice Moldaver points out, since it has the effect of precluding proceedings which determine the merits of a case, something to which the public — and the parties — are entitled.&nbsp; But the public is also entitled to have confidence in the integrity of the justice system.&nbsp; A Crown who makes threats intended to bully an accused into foregoing his or her right to a trial, takes fatal aim at the heart of the public’s confidence in that integrity.</p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT"><u>Analysis</u></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[76]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A stay may be justified for an abuse of process under the residual category when the state’s conduct “contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process” (<i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para.&nbsp;73). A stay may be justified, in exceptional circumstances, when the conduct “is so egregious that the mere fact of going forward [with the trial] in the light of it [would] be offensive” (<i>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 91).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[77]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two public interests at play: “the affront to fair play and decency” and “the effective prosecution of criminal cases”.&nbsp; Where the affront is “disproportionate”, the administration of justice is “best served by staying the proceedings” (<i>R. v. Conway</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[78]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, when the conduct is so profoundly and demonstrably inconsistent with the public perception of what a fair justice system requires, proceeding with a trial means condoning unforgivable conduct.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[79]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown who is the focus of this appeal threatened one of the co-accused, Sergio Piccirilli, on three separate occasions. The threats were made twice to Mr. Piccirilli personally and once to his lawyer. All were to the effect that if Mr. Piccirilli did not plead guilty, he would be charged with additional, serious offences. By the time the trial started several months after the last threat, the Crown was on medical leave and a new Crown was assigned to the case.&nbsp; New charges were in fact brought. <b>&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the Crown’s conduct was in “bad faith”, “unacceptable”, “intolerable”, “unjustifiable”, and was one of the “exceptional and rare cases” that justified a stay.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[81]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal agreed that the threats were “unacceptable” and “outrageous”, but found that the trial judge erred in imposing a stay because he did not undertake a sufficient balancing or sufficiently consider the context.&nbsp; That context included the fact that the threats were made more than a year before the trial began, that counsel did not react immediately, and that the Crown was replaced for health reasons months before the trial started.&nbsp; In other words, the impact of the threats was mitigated by the passage of time and the change in personnel.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With great respect, however, the passage of time does not operate to attenuate what was unpardonable conduct. Time is not a legal remedy for a fundamental breach of the Crown’s role, and cannot retroactively cure intolerable state conduct.&nbsp; The reason, therefore, that the trial judge did not mention the passage of time in assessing the impact of the threats on the public’s confidence in a fair justice system, is that it was not relevant. It was the fact that the threats were made at all that was key, not when they were made (<i>United States of America v.</i> <i>Shulman</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 616).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[83]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I am not persuaded that a balancing exercise was required here. The trial judge was unequivocal in concluding that the abuse justified a stay. There was none of the uncertainty as to the propriety of a stay that this Court said was a condition precedent to the need for a balancing exercise (<i>Tobiass</i>, at para. 92; <i>R. v. Regan</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 57).&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[84]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But in any event, it is not at all clear to me how one goes about such a balancing. When a trial judge has concluded that conduct is “so egregious that the mere fact of going forward in the light of it will be offensive” (<i>Tobiass</i>, at para.&nbsp;91), against what does one balance that singularly egregious state conduct? When a trial judge has found that the conduct cannot be condoned because it is such an exceptional assault on the public’s sense of justice, it seems to me to be conceptually inconsistent to nonetheless ask the court to undermine its own conclusion by re-weighing the half of the scale that contains the public’s interest in trials on the merits.&nbsp; It is one thing to require that trial judges look at the “competing interests at play” (<i>R. v. Bellusci</i>, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, at para.&nbsp;29) before concluding that the state conduct could not be condoned, but how, having concluded that it could not be condoned, can such conduct be subjected to yet <i>another</i> balancing of factors to determine whether it is nonetheless pardonable?</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of course the public has an interest in trials on the merits, but it has an even greater interest in knowing that when the state is involved in proceedings, particularly those that can result in an individual’s loss of liberty, it will put fairness above expedience. Justice is not only about results, it is about how those results are obtained. When a Crown threatens an accused with additional offences if he or she does not plead guilty, the public’s interest in the results of a trial must yield to the transcendent interest in protecting the public’s confidence in the integrity of the justice system.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Bellusci</i>, this Court cautioned appellate courts to exercise restraint with respect to the findings of the trial judge, intervening only if the trial judge “misdirects himself or if his decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice” (para. 17; see also <i>Regan</i>, at para. 117; <i>Tobiass</i>, at para. 87). There was no such misdirection or injustice here. On the contrary, the trial judge concluded that a stay was justified in order to <i>prevent</i> an injustice to the justice system itself.&nbsp; I agree.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeals.</p>
