The trial judge had “absolutely no doubt” that sexual intercourse had taken place between H and A but was not satisfied that A was sexually assaulted without her consent.&nbsp; The Court of appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in law in mishandling the evidence by taking a “piecemeal” approach incompatible with his obligation to consider the cumulative effect of all relevant evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[1]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant was acquitted at trial of two counts of sexual assault on his 17-year-old cousin. The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge had erred in law by failing to consider all of the evidence in reaching his conclusion. The appellant’s appeal to this Court raises both narrow and broader questions.&nbsp; The narrow question is whether the trial judge, in fact, failed to consider the whole of the evidence as the Court of Appeal concluded that he had; the broader question is under what circumstances a trial judge’s alleged mishandling of the evidence gives rise to an error of law alone which justifies appellate intervention on a Crown appeal from an acquittal. Turning first to the narrow question, the trial judge, in my respectful view, did not make the error identified by the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the acquittals entered at trial. However, it will be helpful to address the parties’ and intervener’s submissions on the broader issue concerning when, in a Crown appeal of an acquittal, alleged shortcomings in a trial judge’s assessment of the evidence constitute an error of law alone justifying appellate intervention.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Overview of Facts and Proceedings</u></span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[2]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The complainant alleged that on two occasions the appellant had non-consensual sexual intercourse with her while she was sleeping with him in his bed. She was 17 at the time of both incidents; he was 22 at the time of the first and 23 at the time of the second. The trial judge found that the two incidents described by the complainant had occurred.&nbsp; The main issue, in his view, was whether the sexual activity had been proved to be without the complainant’s consent ([2009] O.J. No. 6377 (QL)).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[3]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The judge found that the appellant had “adopted a lifestyle” that included regular parties at his home and providing young women — including the complainant and her 15-year-old sister — with alcohol (para. 27).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[4]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The first incident described by the complainant occurred in February 2006.&nbsp; The complainant and appellant were socializing in his apartment, including drinking alcohol that he had provided.&nbsp; The complainant’s younger sister as well as the appellant’s roommate and another friend were also present, but the friend left before the others went to sleep.&nbsp; At the end of the evening, the complainant’s sister went to sleep on the couch, the roommate went to sleep in his room and the appellant and complainant went to sleep in the appellant’s bed.&nbsp; The complainant testified her sleeping in the appellant’s bed had not been discussed beforehand.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[5]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The complainant testified that in the early hours of the morning, the appellant moved closer to her and began grabbing and touching her.&nbsp; She testified that she said “stop” but that he eventually had unprotected intercourse with her.&nbsp; She got up, cleaned herself off, walked around the house and returned to bed with the appellant, although she did not sleep.&nbsp; Later in the morning, she got up, woke up her sister and they left.&nbsp; She did not mention the incident, and her sister testified that nothing seemed amiss.&nbsp; The complainant’s sister, however, testified that when she woke up on this occasion, the complainant was in the appellant’s bedroom.&nbsp; When questioned about this apparent inconsistency between her evidence and that of the complainant, her sister responded that she could be confusing it with a different time when they were at the appellant’s house.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[6]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The second incident reported by the complainant occurred in May 2006.&nbsp; She again found herself at the appellant’s apartment, after they both had participated in a long day of moving.&nbsp; She testified that she did not know how she ended up staying the night again.&nbsp; This time, they were alone.&nbsp; After watching movies, they retired to his bed.&nbsp; Once again, she testified that he began touching and kissing her, and that she said “no” before they had unprotected intercourse.&nbsp; Afterwards, she was “too on edge” to leave the apartment, despite having a car, so she returned to the same bed and went to sleep.&nbsp; She left the next day and did not tell anyone about the occurrence.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[7]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The complainant posted a poem online.&nbsp; The judge found that it had been written very soon after the February 2006 incident “as an outlet” (para. 29).&nbsp; Her sister saw the poem on the Internet and the incidents came to light when she began to discuss it with the complainant.&nbsp; The complainant filed a police report, and the appellant was charged with two counts of sexual assault.&nbsp; At trial, the appellant testified and denied any sexual contact with the complainant.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[8]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The trial judge acquitted the appellant on both counts.&nbsp; After summarizing virtually all of the evidence the trial judge found that he had “absolutely no doubt” (para. 26) that sexual intercourse had taken place between the appellant and complainant; he specifically rejected the appellant’s denials in this regard (para. 36). </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[9]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">However, the trial judge acknowledged that he also had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual activity had occurred without the complainant’s consent.&nbsp; He noted some “concerns” in this regard. He referred to the sister’s evidence that she might have been confused between the times that she saw the complainant in the appellant’s bed.&nbsp; The judge said that this caused him to wonder how many times the complainant had ended up in the appellant’s bed.&nbsp; He asked himself “why did [the complainant] insist in going back to the same bed that she had been violated in?” (para. 34).&nbsp; The judge then noted that he suspected “very strongly” that the complainant was confused and that she “wrestled” with going into the accused’s bedroom.&nbsp; He returned to the fact that “[s]he said she went to the bed on her own and it wasn’t even discussed.&nbsp; Why?” (para. 35).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The trial judge referred to the poem the complainant had written, entitled “Black Dark”, and quoted it in its entirety in his oral reasons.&nbsp; As noted, he accepted both that it was written very shortly after the February incident, and that it had been written as an outlet.&nbsp; He then stated, “[w]hen I read [the complainant’s] description of the incidents on February 11th, concerns are raised” (para. 31).&nbsp; He noted that the words “bittersweet” and “regret” which she had used in the poem were “[h]ardly the words that describe a rape” (para. 33).&nbsp; The trial judge then concluded that “[i]n all of the circumstances of this case, notwithstanding that I do not believe the accused, notwithstanding that I am satisfied that sexual intercourse did occur on both of these occasions, I cannot be satisfied that [the complainant] was sexually assaulted without her consent” (para. 36).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown appealed successfully to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial on both counts of the indictment (2009 ONCA 834, 256 O.A.C. 246).&nbsp; The court concluded that the trial judge erred in law in his approach to the evidence.&nbsp; Specifically, it found that he failed to consider some lines of the poem in the context of the others, and that he failed to consider the poem in the context of the complainant’s testimony on consent.&nbsp; This, according to Watt J.A., was a “piecemeal” approach which was incompatible with the trial judge’s obligations to consider the cumulative effect of all relevant evidence (para. 64) and constituted an error of law as set out in this Court’s decision in <i>R. v. B. (G.)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant argues that the trial judge did not approach the evidence in a “piecemeal” fashion. The appellant further argues that even if the trial judge did err as the Court of Appeal suggested, the Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction to entertain a Crown appeal because any error was an error of fact and not an error of law alone as is required by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec676subsec1" target="_blank">s. 676(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c.

In fact, the first eight pages of the transcription of the trial judge’s oral reasons summarize the complainant’s evidence, and her testimony that she did not consent is specifically referred to. The trial judge noted that, in connection with the February incident, the complainant had pushed the appellant away saying “stop” and that she pulled away, at no time consenting to the contact.&nbsp; In relation to the May incident, the trial judge noted that she had said “no” and pushed him away when the appellant started coming closer to her and kissing her, and that she testified that she had never consented to the incidents.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Second, the Court of Appeal’s statement that the trial judge gave no reasons for rejecting the complainant’s evidence is problematic for two reasons: the trial judge did not have to “reject” the complainant’s evidence in order to be left with a reasonable doubt arising from the whole of the evidence, and the trial judge, as we shall see, gave extensive reasons as to why he was left with a reasonable doubt on the issue of consent.</span></p>

Respectfully, these conclusions are not based on a fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons.&nbsp; </span></p>

He expressed his concern, based on the evidence of the relationship between the accused and the complainant and on the testimony of the complainant’s sister, about how many times the complainant had been at the accused’s home and ended up in his bed.&nbsp; He noted that the relationship between the appellant and the complainant was “strong but perverse” (para. 30).&nbsp; After referring to an excerpt from the poem and expressing concern arising from the complainant’s use of the word “regret” in relation to the first incident, the trial judge asked “why did she insist in going back to the same bed that she had been violated in?” (para. 34).&nbsp; This comment, of course, had nothing to do with the language of the poem but was based on the other evidence that he had heard in relation to both incidents. </span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Respectfully, the Court of Appeal erred in its conclusion that the trial judge had taken a “piecemeal” approach to the evidence, and that his use of the poem had been out of context and had “tilted the balance” in his decision to acquit.&nbsp; Further, I do not agree that “[t]he trial judge appears to have used the poem about the events of February 11, 2006, to support his finding on the consent/non-consent issue in connection with the allegation of May 20, 2006” (para. 63).&nbsp; As set out above, a fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons discloses that he had reasonable doubt based on his consideration of all the evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:13.7pt"><span lang="EN-CA">If a trial judge finds all the facts necessary to reach a conclusion in law and in order to reach that conclusion the facts can simply be accepted as found, a Court of Appeal can disagree with the conclusion reached without trespassing on the fact-finding function of the trial judge.

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">In short, the appellate court can simply apply the trial judge’s findings of fact to the proper legal principles; the trial judge’s error, if there is one, may safely be traced to a question of law rather than to any question about how to weigh the evidence.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC"><span lang="EN-CA">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it will be more difficult in an appeal from an acquittal to establish with certainty that the error committed by the trial judge raised a question of law alone because of the burden of proof on the Crown in all criminal prosecutions and the increased importance of examining critically all evidence that may raise a reasonable doubt.

(as she then was), at p. 79, where she wrote: “In the absence of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. misdirection the law is clear that doubts about the reasonableness of the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence [in the context of a Crown appeal of an acquittal] do not constitute questions of law alone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</span></p>

Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle is that it is an error of law to subject individual pieces of evidence to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; the evidence must be looked at as a whole: see, e.g., <i>B. (G.)</i>, at pp. 75-77 and 79.&nbsp; However, Sopinka J. sounded an important warning about how this error may be identified.&nbsp; It is a misapplication<i> </i>of the <i>Morin</i> principle to apply it whenever a trial judge fails to deal with each<i> </i>piece of evidence or record each piece of evidence and his or her assessment of it. As noted in <i>Morin</i> (1992), at p. 296, “A trial judge must consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue but unless the reasons demonstrate that this was not done, the failure to record the fact of it having been done is not a proper basis for concluding that there was an error of law in this respect.” This was the basis of intervention relied on by the Court of Appeal, but as noted earlier, a fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons does not support this finding of legal error.</span></p>

He argues that on a Crown appeal from an acquittal, where the error of law is alleged to be a defect in the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence, a reviewable error arises only where four conditions are met:&nbsp; (a) an error of law has been committed; (b) the misapprehension of the evidence is not properly characterized as either an unreasonable verdict or a miscarriage of justice;&nbsp; (c) the Crown can show with a high degree of certainty that the error affected the verdict; and (d) there has been a shift in a legal burden to the accused. For reasons I will develop, I cannot accept this submission.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant’s first condition — that an error of law has been committed — simply restates the question. The question is under what circumstances may an alleged mishandling of the evidence by the trial judge constitute an error of law alone giving the Crown a right of appeal from an acquittal.&nbsp; I have reviewed four types of situations, which may not be an exhaustive list, in which this may be the case.</span></p>

He bases this position on a statement by Lamer J. in <i>Schuldt</i>, at p. 604: </span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC"><span lang="EN-CA">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a finding of fact that is made in the absence of any supportive evidence is an error of law.

As I explained earlier, the principle set out in <i>Schuldt</i> (and many other cases) is that a reasonable doubt does not need to be based on the evidence; it may arise from an absence of evidence or a simple failure of the evidence to persuade the trier of fact to the requisite level of beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The Court has twice, in <i>Schuldt</i> and <i>B.&nbsp;(G.)</i>, explained the proper basis of the decision in <i>Wild</i>. It is only where a reasonable doubt is tainted by a legal error that appellate intervention in an acquittal is permitted. </span></p>
