-.15pt"> in concluding that the trial judge would inevitably have admitted the hearsay evidence had he properly considered and ruled upon its admissibility.&nbsp; This Court ruled in <i>Khan</i> that a child's out-of-court statement about events at issue in a trial may be received notwithstanding that it is hearsay, provided that the reception of the statement is made necessary by the unavailability of the child's direct evidence on the stand and provided that the out-of-court statement is reasonably reliable.&nbsp; Reliability was conceded&nbsp; and is not in issue here.&nbsp; Necessity, on the <i>Khan</i> test, may be established if the child is incompetent to testify, unable to testify, unavailable to testify, or if the trial judge is satisfied, based on psychological assessments, that testimony in court might be traumatic for the child or harm the child.&nbsp; A reasonable trial judge would inevitably have found the requirement of necessity to be met in this case.&nbsp; It is unrealistic to conclude that R could have communicated his evidence in any useful sense.&nbsp; Moreover, even if R possessed the ability to communicate his evidence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;16(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>b</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, the expert evidence established clearly that he did not understand what it meant to promise to tell the truth, and so he could not meet the requirement of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec16subsec3" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;16(3)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.&nbsp; The evidence also supports a finding of necessity on the grounds of trauma to the child.</span></p>

(3d) 641, at p. 667).&nbsp; Apart from the fact that different conclusions could be drawn from the evidence, some trial judges might have considered speaking to the child under child-friendly circumstances.&nbsp; The trial judge did not even consider this possibility because of the fact that he simply acted on the assumption that the child would not be called by the Crown.&nbsp; I would not conclude, therefore, that but for the failure of the trial judge to make a finding in respect of testimonial competence the verdict would necessarily have been the same.</span></span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span class="1"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The appellant argues that the use of the word "assumption" indicates that the trial judge was not ruling on necessity, but was rather deferring to the prosecution's decision not to call the child as a witness.&nbsp; He submits that the trial judge should have called the child and examined him to see whether he could give useful evidence without undue trauma, rather than simply assuming the child could not testify and that use of the hearsay statements was consequently necessary.</span></span></p>

I don't think he could provide any of that."&nbsp; In the face of this evidence, it is unrealistic to conclude that Ryan could have communicated his evidence in any useful sense either in the courtroom or in a smaller room via closed circuit television.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Khan</i>.&nbsp; In this case, however, I find it unnecessary to decide this issue.&nbsp; Assuming that the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the different purposes for which it could use the different statements constitutes error, I am satisfied that in the circumstances of the case at bar,&nbsp; no reasonable jury receiving the limiting instruction would have arrived at a different conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inconsistencies that the defence relied upon were repeatedly drawn to the attention of the jury.&nbsp; The jury was clearly told that it must consider the inconsistencies in deciding whether to accept Ryan's allegations.&nbsp; The additional statements objected to added no new information capable of strengthening the statements tendered for their truth.&nbsp; The objection to the charge reduces to the suggestion that the jury might have inferred from the subsequent consistent statements that the initial statements were more likely to be true.&nbsp; But this is precisely the inference which a jury is permitted to draw from evidence tendered on credit.&nbsp; In the result, I cannot see how the limiting instruction the defence now says should have been given could have led to acquittal.</span></span></p>
