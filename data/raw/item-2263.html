Only members and their guests were admitted to the club.&nbsp; Prospective members were interviewed to ensure that they were aware of the nature of the activities of the club.&nbsp; Members paid an annual membership fee. A doorman manned the main door of the club, to ensure that only members and their guests entered.&nbsp; The club had three floors.&nbsp; The first floor was occupied by a bar, the second a salon, and the third the “apartment” of the accused.&nbsp; Two doors separated the third floor apartment from the rest of the club.&nbsp; One was marked “<i>Privé</i>” and the other was locked with a numeric key pad.&nbsp; Members of the club were supplied with the appropriate code and permitted to gain access to the third floor apartment.&nbsp; This was the only place where group sex took place.&nbsp; Entry to the club and participation in the activities were voluntary.&nbsp; At trial, the accused was convicted.&nbsp; The trial judge found that the accused’s apartment fell within the meaning of “public place”, as defined in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec197subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;197(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; She also found social harm in the fact that sexual exchanges took place in the presence of other members of the club.&nbsp; She concluded that this conduct was indecent under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>because it was degrading and dehumanizing, was calculated to induce anti‑social behaviour in its disregard for moral values, and raised the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.&nbsp; A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the accused’s conviction.</p>

24.4pt">In this case, the accused must be acquitted.&nbsp; The autonomy and liberty of members of the public was not affected by unwanted confrontation with the sexual conduct in question.&nbsp; On the evidence, only those already disposed to this sort of sexual activity were allowed to participate and watch.&nbsp; There is also no evidence of anti‑social acts or attitudes toward women, or for that matter men.&nbsp; No one was pressured to have sex, paid for sex, or treated as a mere sexual object for the gratification of others.&nbsp; The fact that the club is a commercial establishment does not in itself render the sexual activities taking place there commercial in nature.&nbsp; The membership fee buys access to a club where members can meet and engage in consensual activities with other individuals who have similar sexual interests.&nbsp; Finally, with respect to the third type of harm, the only possible danger to participants on the evidence was the risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease.&nbsp; However, this must be discounted as a factor because it is conceptually and causally unrelated to indecency. &nbsp;Since the Crown failed to establish the first requirement to prove indecent criminal conduct, it is unnecessary to proceed to the second branch of the test.&nbsp; If one did, there seems to be no evidence that the degree of alleged harm rose to the level of&nbsp; incompatibility with the proper functioning of society.

24.4pt">The new approach to indecency proposed by the majority is neither desirable nor workable.&nbsp; Not only does it constitute an unwarranted break with the most important principles of our past decisions regarding indecency, but it also replaces the community standard of tolerance with a harm‑based test.&nbsp; Whether or not serious social harm is sustained has never been the determinative test for indecency.&nbsp; Moreover, when the standard of tolerance is established on the basis of the three categories of harm, it becomes impossible to take into account the multitude of situations that could exceed the threshold for indecency.&nbsp; This new harm‑based approach also strips of all relevance the social values that the Canadian community as a whole believes should be protected.&nbsp; The existence of harm is not a prerequisite for exercising the state’s power to criminalize certain conduct: the existence of fundamental social and ethical considerations is sufficient.&nbsp; Lastly, in the context of an offence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec210subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;210(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, it is not absolutely necessary to consider the harm done to society.

24.4pt">To determine whether acts are indecent, it is preferable to continue applying the original test for indecency, which focusses on a contextual analysis of the impugned acts and incorporates the concept of harm as a significant, but not determinative, factor to consider in establishing the applicable level of tolerance.&nbsp; Whether or not harm is sustained is merely one of several indicators or contextual factors that make it possible to gauge the degree of tolerance of the Canadian community.&nbsp; Although a certain degree of subjectivity is inherent in the establishment of the standard of tolerance because of the judge’s role as interpreter of the community’s minimum standards regarding sex, the analysis remains objective as long as the judge ignores his or her personal convictions and instead tries to determine the nature of the social consensus.&nbsp;[76] [134]</p>

24.4pt">The question that must therefore be asked in the case at bar is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do the impugned acts offend the standard of tolerance of the contemporary Canadian community, having regard to the place and context in which they occurred?”&nbsp; The following contextual factors may be considered in determining the standard of tolerance:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;the private or public nature of the place; (2)&nbsp;the type of participants and the composition of the audience; (3)&nbsp;the nature of the warning given regarding the acts; (4)&nbsp;the measures taken to limit access to the place; (5)&nbsp;the commercial nature of the place and the acts; (6)&nbsp;the purpose of the acts; (7)&nbsp;the conduct of the participants; and (8)&nbsp;harm suffered by the participants.&nbsp; Regarding this last factor, attention must be paid to the risk of physical or psychological harm.&nbsp; This approach permits the risk of spreading sexually transmitted diseases to be taken into account.&nbsp; Finally, the consent of the participants or the fact that those present are informed adults is not in itself a determinative factor.&nbsp; A consensual sexual act that is totally acceptable in one situation may be indecent if it is performed in another context.&nbsp; It is the tolerance of the general public that counts, not the tolerance of the participants or spectators.&nbsp;[81] [122] [131‑132]</p>

For example, in the early case of&nbsp; <i>R. v.

This is not to say that social values no longer have a role to play.&nbsp; On the contrary, to ground a finding that acts are indecent,&nbsp; the harm must be shown to be related to a fundamental value reflected in our society’s Constitution or similar fundamental laws, like bills of rights, which constitutes society’s formal recognition that harm of the sort envisaged may be incompatible with its proper functioning.&nbsp; Unlike the community standard of tolerance test, the requirement of formal recognition inspires confidence that the values upheld by judges and jurors are truly those of Canadian society.&nbsp; Autonomy, liberty, equality and human dignity are among these values.</p>

The harm is not the aesthetic harm of a less attractive community, but the loss of autonomy and liberty that public indecency may impose on individuals&nbsp; in society, as they seek to avoid confrontation with acts they find offensive and unacceptable.&nbsp; The value or interest protected is the autonomy and liberty of members of the public, to live within a zone that is free from conduct that deeply offends them.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Times change, and ideas change with them. Compared to the Victorian era this is a liberal age in which we live.&nbsp; One manifestation of it is the relative freedom with which the whole question of sex is discussed.&nbsp; In books, magazines, movies, television, and sometimes even in parlour conversation, various aspects of sex are made the subject of comment, with a candour that in an earlier day would have been regarded as indecent and intolerable.&nbsp; We cannot and should not ignore these present-day attitudes when we face the question whether Dude and Escapade are obscene according to our criminal law.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Only if the impact of the acts in degree of harm poses a real risk of damaging the autonomy and liberty of members of the public, judged by contemporary standards, can indecency be established.</p>
