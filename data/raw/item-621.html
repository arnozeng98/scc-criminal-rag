 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second misdirection Wilson J. suggests is that the trial judge failed to instruct himself that the evidence of C.Z. should be looked at to see if it was capable of corroborating the evidence of the complainant.&nbsp; This might be valid if one were instructing a jury serving as the trier of fact.&nbsp; But where a trial judge is sitting as a trier of fact, it is open to him to reject the evidence of a witness as lacking credibility and hence not being capable of constituting corroboration.&nbsp; In those circumstances it would be wrong for a trial judge to instruct himself or herself that the evidence of the witness should be considered to see if it was capable of corroborating the other evidence.&nbsp; Again, this leaves me unable to conclude that there was error of law or misdirection.</span></p>
