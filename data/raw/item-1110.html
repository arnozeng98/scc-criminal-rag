Director of Public Prosecutions</i> and <i>McVey (Re); McVey v. United States of America</i>) do not warrant a change in this practice.&nbsp; </span></p>

T.S. 1976 No. 3, Art. 1.&nbsp; That approach seems to me to be even more compelling in the case of a federal offence, like the one in question here, where the whole of the United States is the appropriate jurisdiction.&nbsp; The specification in the indictment that the offence is alleged to have occurred in Allentown in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is presumably there to ground jurisdiction for the purposes of domestic United States law in the court of that district, but one cannot ignore the reference to the fact that the offence charged includes activities that take place "elsewhere".&nbsp; And as will become apparent later, there were sufficient acts committed in other parts of the United States to give that country jurisdiction, at least in accordance with the Canadian law on the subject.&nbsp; I leave aside for the moment whether there might even have been sufficient links in the State of Pennsylvania to support jurisdiction on that ground.&nbsp; For I wish now to turn to the issue on which the appellant grounded its appeal, namely, whether an extradition judge has jurisdiction to entertain any of those questions.</span></p>

E-23, he added, was to determine whether such evidence has been produced as would, according to Canadian law, justify the committal of the fugitive for trial if the crime had been committed in Canada.&nbsp; The whole matter of the jurisdiction of the requesting state, he maintained, fell outside the ambit of the extradition judge's function.&nbsp; Assuming, which he denied, that the extradition judge had any role to play in considering the requesting state's jurisdiction to prosecute, it could only be in terms of fitting the facts constituting the offence into the Canadian legal framework in the course of performing his task of determining whether the acts charged would constitute a crime according to the law of Canada ‑‑ a type of "mirror image" approach under which only the specific acts that took place in the United States would be considered to have taken place in Canada.</span></p>

Mellino</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 536, at p. 553.&nbsp; If such evidence has been produced, the judge must commit the fugitive for surrender; otherwise the judge must discharge him.&nbsp; There is nothing in the Act that requires the judge to consider where the acts charged took place, or the jurisdiction of the requesting state.&nbsp; The issue of the jurisdiction of the requesting state and its organs to prosecute a crime is essentially a matter governed by the law of that state.&nbsp; And the decision of this Court in <i>McVey (Re); McVey v. United States of America</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 475, at p. 529, (a case, it should be said, that had not been decided at the time of the extradition hearing in the present case) makes it clear that "the extradition judge `is not concerned with foreign law at all'".&nbsp; The difficulties and delays inherent in a judge's examining issues of foreign law are fully set forth in <i>McVey</i>, at p. 528, and I need not repeat them.&nbsp; I need only say that, if anything, the determination of the jurisdiction of a foreign state by a judge unfamiliar with the relevant law seems to me to be an even more thorny task than a determination of the substantive law of that state.</span></p>

E-23 (the "Act") that a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out that, if the crime were committed in Canada, a committal for trial would be justified.</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">There is, it is true, some discretion in the federal government under the treaties to refuse surrender, for example, where the crime is one of a political character.&nbsp; There may, as well, be cases where the government, for high political purposes or for the protection of an accused, may be prepared not to conform with a treaty.&nbsp; But this executive discretion would rarely be exercised and is impossible to define in the abstract.&nbsp; That is scarcely surprising.&nbsp; The extradition process is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations.&nbsp; As was noted in <i>Canada v.

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, <i>supra</i>, which in turn relied on <i>Schtraks v. Government of Israel</i>, [1964] A.C. 556.&nbsp; I make two observations.&nbsp; First, neither of these cases addresses the issue in this case.&nbsp; Second, to the extent that the language in the cases supports a narrowing of the judicial role and expansion of that of the executive, it cannot be transplanted to Canada where the provisions of our Act are designed to protect "as much as possible" the rights of the individual which are guaranteed by a charter of rights and freedoms.</span></p>

Government of Kelantan</i>, [1924] A.C. 797; <i>Taylor v. Barclay</i> (1828), 2 Sim. 213, 57 E.R. 769; and <i>Chateau-Gai Wines Ltd. v. Attorney General of Canada</i>, [1970] Ex. C.R. 366.&nbsp; </span></p>
