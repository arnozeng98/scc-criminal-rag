He conducted interviews with three female applicants and with a police officer who posed as an applicant and recorded the interview on a tape recorder. Appellant indicated to the applicants that a secretary/sales assistant would be expected to have sexual intercourse with clients or potential clients of the company where that appeared to be necessary to conclude a contract. He also indicated that a successful secretary/sales assistant could earn as much as $100,000 annually through commission or bonus on the sale of franchises. Appellant did not make an offer of employment to any of the three applicants who became uninterested after hearing the requirements of the position. The police officer, while not made an offer, was told to think it over and let appellant know when she expressed an interest in the position notwithstanding its requirements. At trial, appellant was acquitted of counts of (1) attempting to procure female persons to become common prostitutes and (2) attempting to procure female persons to have illicit intercourse with another person. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from acquittal on the first count, but allowed the appeal with respect to the second and ordered a new trial. Appellant appealed. At issue here are: (1) whether appellant's acts or statements could, as a matter of law, constitute an attempt to procure rather than mere preparation; and (2) whether the sexual intercourse contemplated by appellant would be illicit sexual intercourse within <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec195subsec1" target="_blank">s. 195(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

The provision is parallel to and of the same kind as that in s. 195(1)(<i>d</i>), which makes it an offence to procure a person to become a prostitute although prostitution is not itself a crime. This is true of all the offences created by s. 195. They are directed to conduct which is designed to encourage or promote conduct which itself is not criminal. If fault be found with that legislative policy it is for Parliament to make the necessary changes, not for the court to do so by giving the word "illicit" in s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) such a restricted meaning as not only to give s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) a very limited, if not improbable application, but also to restrict very severely the application of other important provisions of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> for the protection of girls and women in which the words "illicit sexual intercourse" are used. </span></p>

It would clearly be an important step in the commission of the offence. Before an offer of employment could be made in such circumstances an applicant would have to seek the position, despite its special requirement. Thus such inducement or persuasion would be the decisive act in the procuring. There would be little else that the appellant would be required to do towards the completion of the offence other than make the formal offer of employment. The holding out of the large financial rewards in the course of the interviews would not lose its quality as a step in the commission of the offence, and thus as an <i>actus reus</i> of attempt, because a considerable period of time might elapse before a person engaged for the position had sexual intercourse with prospective clients or because of the otherwise contingent nature of such sexual intercourse.</span></p>

During this period the appellant placed an advertisement in newspapers in Ottawa, Hamilton and Toronto inviting applications for the position of secretary/sales assistant and conducted interviews with three women who responded to the advertisement and with a police officer who posed as an applicant for the position and recorded the interview on a tape recorder.

The appellant did not make an offer of employment to the three applicants who testified at his trial.

Graburn Co. Ct. J. acquitted the appellant on both counts. He found that the appellant intended that a person hired for the position should have sexual relations with clients or potential clients, but he held, as a matter of law, that the acts or statements of the appellant did not, in the absence of an offer of employment, constitute the <i>actus</i> <i>reus</i> of an attempt to procure. In his opinion they were mere preparation. He accordingly did not find it necessary to decide whether the sexual intercourse contemplated by the appellant would be illicit sexual intercourse within s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) or make those who engaged in it common prostitutes within s. 195(1)(<i>d</i>), as it then read.</span></p>

The Court held that the trial judge erred in concluding that the acts or statements of the appellant could not, in the absence of an offer of employment, constitute an attempt to procure rather than mere preparation. It held that there was evidence from which the trial judge could have concluded that there was both the <i>mens</i> <i>rea</i> and the <i>actus</i> <i>reus</i> required for an attempt to procure. The Court also held that the sexual intercourse contemplated by the appellant would be illicit sexual intercourse within s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>).

The English statute 18 Eliz., c. 7, of 1575‑76 created the offence of "unlawfully and carnally" knowing and abusing any girl under ten years of age. The same offence was contained in the English statute 9&nbsp;Geo. 4, c. 31, of 1828, as well as the offence of "unlawfully and carnally" knowing and abusing any girl between the ages of ten and twelve. The statute 24 &amp; 25 Vict., c. 100, of 1861, created the offence of procuring a woman or girl under twenty‑one to have "illicit carnal connexion" with any man. Section 2(1) of the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885</i> (U.K.), 48 &amp; 49 Vict., c. 69, made it an offence to procure or attempt to procure any girl or woman under twenty‑one years of age, not being a common prostitute, or of known immoral character, to have "unlawful carnal connexion" with any other person. <i>The Criminal Code, 1892</i> (Can.), c. 29, used the expressions "illicit connection" (ss. 181, 182, 183, 184), "unlawful carnal connection" (s. 185(<i>a</i>), (<i>g</i>), (<i>h</i>), (<i>i</i>)), "illicit intercourse" (s. 185(<i>b</i>)), and "unlawfully and carnally" (ss. 187, 189). Section 185(<i>a</i>) created the offence, modelled on s. 2(1) of the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885</i>, of procuring or attempting to procure any girl or woman under twenty‑one years of age, not being a common prostitute or of known immoral character, to have "unlawful carnal connection" with any other person. The expression "unlawful carnal connection" was retained in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, s. 216(<i>a</i>), as amended by <i>The Criminal Code Amendment Act, 1913</i> (Can.), c. 13, s. 9, and in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 216(<i>a</i>). The expression "illicit connection" appears in ss. 211, 212, 213 and 214 of the <i>Code</i> of 1927.</span></p>

In <i>H.M. Advocate v. Watson</i> (1885), 13 S.C.(J.) 6, 23 Scot. L.R. 267, the issue was the meaning of "unlawful carnal knowledge" in s. 5 of the <i>Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885</i>, which created the offence of unlawfully and carnally knowing or attempting to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of thirteen and sixteen. Lord Craighill, in charging the jury, said that "unlawful carnal knowledge is neither more nor less, where the woman is over thirteen and under sixteen years of age, than carnal knowledge by one who is not her husband."</span></p>

It was contended, as in the case at bar with reference to the word "illicit", that the word "unlawful" meant prohibited by the criminal law or other provision or rule of positive law. The Ontario Court of Appeal unanimously rejected this contention. Osler and Maclaren JJ.A. both quoted the following passage from the judgment of Bramwell B. in <i>Cowan v.

It was contended, as in the other cases to which I have referred, that "unlawful" meant contrary to some enactment of positive law.

It would be natural, however, for the framers of a statute, in days when the canon law would be more in their minds than today, to refer to any intercourse outside the bond of matrimony as "unlawful"; and for their successors when drafting consolidating Acts simply to repeat the word without a close consideration of its necessity or precise meaning.</span></p>

The argument, at once, prompts the question why, if the intercourse in question is already positively forbidden, section 19 should do it again.... the plain purpose of section 19 is to protect young unmarried girls. That protection would be largely, if not wholly, illusory if in every case it were incumbent on the prosecution to prove that she was taken from her parents for the purpose of intercourse of a kind positively forbidden by some enactment, and not for intercourse not so forbidden.

We do not think it is surplusage, because otherwise a man who took such a girl out of her parents' possession against their will with the honest and bona fide intention of marrying her might have no defence, even if he carried out that intention. In our view, the word simply means "illicit," i.e., outside the bond of marriage. In other words, we take the same view as the trial judge. We think this interpretation accords with the common sense of the matter, and with what we think was the obvious intention of Parliament.</span></p>

Indeed, this would appear to be true of all the offences created by s. 195. They are directed to conduct which is designed to encourage or promote conduct which is not itself criminal. If fault be found with that legislative policy it is for Parliament to make the necessary changes, not for a court to do so by giving the word "illicit" in s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) such a restricted meaning as not only to give s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) a very limited, if not improbable, application, but also to restrict very severely the application of other important provisions of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> for the protection of girls and women in which the words "illicit sexual intercourse" are used.</span></p>

Procuring a person to commit any of the above offences which involve a prohibition of sexual intercourse in certain circumstances, apart from the unlikelihood of its arising in most cases, is already made a criminal offence by s. 22 of the <i>Code</i>. It is highly unlikely that Parliament would have considered s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) necessary for such a purpose. On this view of the meaning of "illicit sexual intercourse" there would remain, however, the possibility of making it an offence to procure a female person to have sexual intercourse with another person in any of the above situations. This too, however, would severely limit the application of s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) and in a manner that would appear to be contrary to an earlier expression of legislative intention. For example, limiting the offence created by s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) to procuring a female person under the age of fourteen years or between fourteen and sixteen years of age to have sexual intercourse with another person (s. 146(1) and (2)) would not only severely limit the extent to which s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) could apply to the kind of procuring to which it is obviously directed, but would be contrary to the legislative intention earlier evidenced by the removal of the age limit that was formerly in the provision which is now s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>). (Cf. s. 185(<i>a</i>) of <i>The Criminal Code, 1892</i>, referred to above). </span></p>

I have referred to three of them: s. 153(1)(<i>a</i>), which makes it a criminal offence to have illicit sexual intercourse with a stepdaughter, foster daughter or female ward; s. 153(1)(<i>b</i>), which makes it a criminal offence for a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with a female person of previously chaste character and under the age of twenty‑one years who is in his employment or is in a common, but not necessarily similar, employment with him and is, in respect of her employment or work, under or in any way subject to his control or direction or receives her wages or salary directly or indirectly from him; and s. 154, which makes it a criminal offence for an owner or master of a vessel or a person employed thereon, to seduce or, by the exercise of his authority, have illicit sexual intercourse on board the vessel with a female passenger. To these may be added the following provisions: s. 166(<i>a</i>), which makes it a criminal offence for a parent or guardian of a female person to procure her to have illicit sexual intercourse with a person other than the procurer; and s. 167, which makes it a criminal offence for the owner, occupier or manager of premises, or one having control thereof or assisting in the management or control thereof, to permit a female person under the age of eighteen to resort to or to be in or upon the premises for the purpose of having illicit sexual intercourse with a particular male person or with male persons generally. Parliament cannot have intended that these offences should be limited to cases in which the resulting sexual intercourse is otherwise prohibited by the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. This is particularly unthinkable, for example, of the offence of having illicit sexual intercourse with a stepdaughter, foster daughter or female ward.</span></p>

It is also of interest to note the change made by New Zealand legislation in the provision which corresponds to s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Code</i>. Section 218 of the New Zealand <i>Crimes</i> <i>Act 1908</i> (N.Z.), No. 32, provided: "Every one is liable to two years' imprisonment...who, from motives of lucre, by false pretences, or false representations, or other fraudulent means, procures any woman or girl under the age of twenty‑one years to have illicit carnal connection with any man." It was replaced by s. 149 of the <i>Crimes Act</i> <i>1961</i> (N.Z.), No. 43, which reads: "Every one is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years who, for gain or reward, procures or agrees or offers to procure any woman or girl to have sexual intercourse with any male who is not her husband." This reflects, I think, what has been traditionally and generally understood by the word "unlawful" or "illicit" in this context.</span></p>

He said:</span></p>

While it is unnecessary for me to decide the issue, it would seem to me that if an offer of employment had been accepted by the women, then the full offence of procuring would have been established. I am of the view that had there been an offer of employment to the women in question, then an attempt to procure would have been established by the crown.The placement of the advertisements in the paper cannot, standing by itself, be considered as anything other than mere preparation. It is too remote towards the commission of the offence. Likewise, in my judgment, so is the interview considered solely in the light of the job specifications. An explanation of what the applicant would be required to do does not constitute an attempt to cause or induce a status or act prohibited by Section 195. The professed rewards attendant upon such a status or act cannot in my judgment constitute an act going beyond mere preparation, unless the position was offered to the applicant. The allure of the rewards remains in the area of preparation. Had the position been offered to the applicant, then there would be an act immediately connected with the commission of the offence, although it would not necessarily be the last act in the accused's attempt, but absent such an offer, as a question of law, the interviews and the contents of them remain, in my judgment, preparation only. I consider that the interview and its content was an act remotely leading to the commission of the offence, and was not an act immediately connected with it, nor sufficiently proximate to it so as to constitute an attempt; the latter language being used by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of <i>Sorrell</i> and <i>Bondett</i> which was decided in 1978 and is reported in 41 C.C.C.

I interpret that finding in its context as a finding that the respondent in the interviews with the three young women who answered the advertisement and with Constable Barkey did state and meant to state that the position required them to have sexual intercourse with clients or potential clients, and further that he contemplated that such sexual intercourse would take place as incidental to the employment. The trial judge made no finding that the respondent endeavoured to persuade the applicants to take the job and it is, I think, clear on the evidence that the respondent did not expressly attempt to persuade them to take such employment and indeed the trial judge found that the respondent had never offered the position to any of them. The holding out of large financial rewards in the context of the interviews was capable, however, not only of providing evidence of an intention to induce the applicants to become so employed, but was also capable of constituting the <i>actus reus</i> of an attempt to procure the applicants to have illicit sexual intercourse contrary to s. 195.</span></p>

I think, however, that in this case there was evidence upon which it would be open to a court to find that the respondent by holding out the lure of large financial rewards intended to induce the women in question to accept employment involving sexual intercourse with clients or potential clients if necessary to further his business interests and that the respondent contemplated that such sexual intercourse would be required and would occur as a normal incident of the employment. If the trial judge made those findings it would be open to him to find that the respondent had attempted to procure the women in question to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person. On the other hand, if the respondent never intended to offer the employment to the women in question, that would, of course, negative an intention to induce them to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person. These are issues of fact entirely within the province of the trial judge. The respondent's liability for attempting to procure the women for the proscribed purpose was not dependent, however, on whether he had formally offered them the job. The holding out of the financial rewards with the requisite intent to persuade the women to have illicit sexual intercourse with clients or prospective clients was itself sufficient to constitute the <i>actus reus</i> of an attempt to procure the women in question to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person.</span></p>

All of them have been pronounced by academic commentators to be unsatisfactory in some degree. For a thorough analysis of the various tests, with suggestions for an improved test, see Meehan, <i>The Law of Criminal Attempt‑‑A Treatise</i>, 1984, chapter 5, and Stuart, <i>Canadian Criminal Law</i>, 1982, pp. 529 ff. There is a succinct appraisal of the various tests in the English Law Commission's Report No. 102 of 1980 entitled, <i>Criminal Law: Attempt, and Impossibility in relation to Attempt, Conspiracy and Incitement</i>. It has been frequently observed that no satisfactory general criterion has been, or can be, formulated for drawing the line between preparation and attempt, and that the application of this distinction to the facts of a particular case must be left to common sense judgment. See, for example, <i>Kelley v. Hart</i> (1934), 61 C.C.C. 364, <i>per</i> McGillivray J.A. at p. 370; <i>R. v. Brown</i>, [1947] O.W.N. 419, <i>per</i> Laidlaw J.A. at p. 421; <i>R. v. Cline</i> (1956), 115 C.C.C. 18, <i>per</i> Laidlaw J.A. at p. 26; and <i>Haughton v. Smith</i>, [1975] A.C. 476, <i>per</i> Lord Reid at p. 499. Despite academic appeals for greater clarity and certainty in this area of the law I find myself in essential agreement with this conclusion.</span></p>

Ancio</i>, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, where the issue was the intent required for attempted murder. McIntyre J., in the course of a review of the development of the law of attempt, said with reference to the <i>mens rea</i> and the <i>actus reus</i> of attempt at p. 247:</span></p>

He contended that any act not "immediately connected with" the completed crime would be too remote to constitute an attempt. Even under the cases which he cited the accused may still have one or more acts to do, and these may be separated by an intervening period of time, in order to complete the offence and yet may be guilty of an attempt.</span></p>

It might be the beginning of the attempt, but would none the less be an attempt." Taschereau J., dissenting, in <i>Henderson</i>, although he differed in the result, would not appear to have applied a different concept of proximity.

The Queen</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 583, which involved a conviction for attempted fraud, Laskin C.J. raised a question, as I read his reasons, as to the weight to be given to the proximity test in the essential task under s. 24 of the <i>Code</i> of distinguishing between preparation and attempt. With reference to the contention of counsel that "proximity was an essential requirement in the sense, to put it generally, that the actions of the accused must go beyond mere preparation and close (a question of degree) to the realization of his purpose", Laskin C.J. said at p. 586:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This leaves for consideration the so‑called proximity principle. It may well be that this is envisaged by the reference to remoteness in s. 24(2), but I do not see that it advances the essential issue in attempt which requires going beyond mere preparation. Nor do I find cogency in the appellant's submission that if there is impossibility this does not bring any act of the accused closer to realization so as to establish proximity. I read s. 24(1) as making a different distinction, one merely requiring proof of intent and of accused going beyond mere preparation by making, as in this case, a false representation even though not resulting in full realization of his objective.</span></p>

That is reflected, I think, in the conclusion of the majority in <i>Henderson</i> and in the conclusion of the Ontario Court of Appeal with respect to <i>actus reus</i> in <i>R. v. Sorrell and Bondett</i> (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 9. But an act which on its face is an act of commission does not lose its quality as the <i>actus reus</i> of attempt because further acts were required or because a significant period of time may have elapsed before the completion of the offence.</span></p>

The trial judge held that the offence of procuring would have been completed, in the particular context of this case, by the acceptance of an offer of employment. The Court of Appeal held, citing <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (1963), 48 Cr.App.R. 25, and <i>R. v. Gruba</i>, [1969] 2 C.C.C. 365, that the offence of procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person is not committed unless sexual intercourse actually takes place. In the appeal to this Court the respondent accepted this statement of the law as to what is required for the complete offence of procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person. It was not challenged, and I accept it for purposes of deciding whether the acts of the appellant could, as a matter of law, constitute the <i>actus reus</i> of an attempt to procure.</span></p>

It would clearly be a step, and an important step, in the commission of the offence. Before an offer of employment could be made in such circumstances an applicant would have to seek the position, despite its special requirement. Thus such inducement or persuasion would be the decisive act in the procuring. There would be little else that the appellant would be required to do towards the completion of the offence other than to make the formal offer of employment. I am further of the opinion that the holding out of the large financial rewards in the course of the interviews would not lose its quality as a step in the commission of the offence, and thus as an <i>actus reus</i> of attempt, because a considerable period of time might elapse before a person engaged for the position had sexual intercourse with prospective clients or because of the otherwise contingent nature of such sexual intercourse.</span></p>

In concurring in his judgment, I should like to add a brief comment. While I agree with the scope of his definition of the expression "illicit sexual intercourse" I should like to underline the fact that this agreement is to the extent those words are resorted to in the context of the procuring or soliciting thereof in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec195subsec1" target="_blank">s. 195(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>(<i>a</i>) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. While under the facts of this case it is clear that Deutsch was acting for the purpose of gain, and there is no need to address the question whether such a purpose is an essential ingredient of the notion of procuring or soliciting, I should say that my accepting such a wide definition of "illicit sexual intercourse" is dependent upon being of the view (and if and as long as that view prevails) that it is an essential ingredient of "procuring" or of "soliciting" under s. 195(1)(<i>a</i>) that what is being done is done for lucre, gain, or some advantage to the accused.</span></p>
