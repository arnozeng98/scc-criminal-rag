 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">This was the sum total of Scollin J.'s charge on the application of s. 21(1).&nbsp; While I agree with Cory J. that the trial judge did adequately instruct the jury on the distinction between first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter elsewhere in his charge, the portion of his charge that I have quoted was not only inadequate but clearly erroneous.&nbsp; First, it would have been preferable for Scollin J. to have defined the legal meaning of aiding and abetting.&nbsp; Second, the trial judge made no mention of the "type of offence" rule which I have set out.&nbsp; Third, and more importantly, if the jury found that Kirkness had aided the sexual assault, the question for the jury was not whether Kirkness was aware that death would ensue, but rather whether he was aware that bodily harm would have been the result.&nbsp; Scollin J. was, in my view, quite wrong in his explanation of the mental element to be established for a conviction of manslaughter.&nbsp; I believe that had these errors and omissions not been made, the verdict might not necessarily have been the same.</span></p>
