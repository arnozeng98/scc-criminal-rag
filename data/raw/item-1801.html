24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The application of the confessions rule is of necessity contextual.&nbsp; Hard and fast rules simply cannot account for the variety of circumstances that vitiate the voluntariness of a confession.&nbsp; When reviewing a confession, a trial judge should therefore consider all the relevant factors.&nbsp; The judge should strive to understand the circumstances surrounding the confession and ask if it gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to the confession’s voluntariness, taking into account all the aspects of the rule.&nbsp; The relevant factors include threats or promises, oppression, the operating mind requirement and police trickery.&nbsp; While obviously imminent threats of torture will render a confession inadmissible, most cases will not be so clear.&nbsp; The use of veiled threats, for instance, requires close examination.&nbsp; The police may often offer some kind of inducement to the suspect to obtain a confession.&nbsp; This becomes improper only when the inducements, whether standing alone or in combination with other factors, are strong enough to raise a reasonable doubt about the voluntariness of the confession. An important consideration in all cases is to look for a <i>quid pro quo</i> offer by interrogators, regardless of whether it comes in the form of a threat or a promise.&nbsp; Oppressive conditions and circumstances&nbsp; clearly also have the potential to produce an involuntary confession.&nbsp; In assessing oppression, courts should consider whether a suspect was deprived of food, clothing, water, sleep, or medical attention; was denied access to counsel; was confronted with fabricated evidence; or was questioned aggressively for a prolonged period of time.&nbsp; The operating mind doctrine only requires that the accused knows what he is saying and that it may be used to his detriment.&nbsp; Like oppression, the operating mind doctrine should not be understood as a discrete inquiry completely divorced from the rest of the confessions rule.&nbsp; The operating mind doctrine is just one application of the general rule that involuntary confessions are inadmissible.&nbsp; Lastly, the police use of trickery to obtain a confession must also be considered in determining whether a confession is voluntary or not.&nbsp; This doctrine is a distinct inquiry.&nbsp; While it is still related to voluntariness, its more specific objective is maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice system.&nbsp; There may be situations in which police trickery, though neither violating the right to silence nor undermining voluntariness <i>per se</i>, is so appalling as to shock the community.&nbsp; In such cases, the confessions should be excluded.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In sum, because of the criminal justice system’s overriding concern not to convict the innocent, a confession will not be admissible if it is made under circumstances that raise a reasonable doubt as to voluntariness.&nbsp; Voluntariness is the touchstone of the confessions rule and a useful term to describe the various rationales underlying the rule.&nbsp; If the police interrogators subject the suspect to utterly intolerable conditions, or if they offer inducements strong enough to produce an unreliable confession, the trial judge should exclude it.&nbsp; Between these two extremes, oppressive conditions and inducements can operate together to exclude confessions.&nbsp; If the trial judge properly considers all the relevant circumstances, then a finding regarding voluntariness is essentially a factual one, and should only be overturned for some palpable and overriding error which affected the trial judge’s assessment of the facts.</span></p>

There was never any insinuation of a <i>quid pro quo</i>.&nbsp; The police did suggest that confession would make the accused feel better, that his fiancée and members of the community would respect him for admitting his problem, and that he could better address his apparent pyromania if he confessed.&nbsp; However, read in context, none of these statements contained an implied threat or promise.&nbsp; As to the alleged threats against the accused’s fiancée, there were moments when the police intimated that it might be necessary to question her to make sure she was not involved in the fires.&nbsp; The relationship the accused had with his fiancée was strong enough potentially to induce a false confession were she threatened with harm.&nbsp; However, no such threat ever occurred.&nbsp; The most they did was promise not to polygraph her if the accused confessed.&nbsp; Given the entire context, the most likely reason to polygraph her was not as a suspect, but as an alibi witness.&nbsp; This is not a strong enough inducement to raise a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the accused’s confession.&nbsp; The timing of the comments regarding his fiancée suggests that there was no causal connection between the police inducements and the subsequent confession.&nbsp; The police did not improperly abuse the accused’s trust to obtain a confession.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal criticized the police for questioning the accused in such a gentle, reassuring manner that they gained his trust.&nbsp; This does not render a confession inadmissible.&nbsp; Lastly, to hold that the police conduct in this interrogation was oppressive would leave little scope for police interrogation.&nbsp; They were always courteous; they did not deprive the accused of food, sleep, or water; they never denied him access to the bathroom; they fully apprised him of his rights at all times, and they did not fabricate evidence.&nbsp; While the re‑enactment was admittedly done at a time when the accused had had little sleep, he was already awake when they approached him, and was told that he could stop at any time.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; There were improper inducements held out by police officers who interrogated the accused and these inducements, considered cumulatively and contextually in light of the “failed” polygraph test, require the exclusion of the accused’s statements.&nbsp; Moreover, the proximity and the causal connection between the “failed” polygraph test and the confession also compels this result.&nbsp; While some deference is always required because of the privileged position from which the trial judge assesses credibility, including on a <i>voir</i> <i>dire</i>, appeal courts must ensure that the question of the voluntariness of a confession was correctly decided by the trial judge, in accordance with the applicable law, and on a reasonable view of the facts.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The statements were obtained as a result of fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held out by persons in authority.&nbsp; Repeated threats and promises were made.&nbsp; They were often subtle, but against the backdrop of the polygraph procedure, they overwhelmed the free will of the accused.&nbsp; The overall interrogation strategy was sound, and although it relied on considerable deception on the part of the police, that in itself is neither illegal nor sufficient to vitiate the voluntary nature of a confession.&nbsp; The line is crossed when, as here, improper inducements are put forward by persons in authority in an oppressive atmosphere, undermining the interrogated person’s control over his mind and will.&nbsp; First, the promise of psychiatric help was improper.&nbsp; While it is true that the police did not explicitly tell the accused that the only way he could get psychiatric help was if he confessed, this was the clear implication of what was said.&nbsp; Second, after the accused’s initial confession,&nbsp; the police minimized the seriousness of the additional legal consequences that would flow from a confession to all the fires, suggesting to the accused that it made no difference whether he had set one or ten fires and that if he confessed, the other fires could be bundled with the car fire.&nbsp; This was clearly improper.&nbsp; Third, the threat to interrogate the accused’s fiancée clearly suggested that the accused could spare her his predicament by admitting his sole involvement in all the fires.&nbsp; The relationship between her and the accused was such that the threats to implicate her placed impermissible pressure on the accused to confess.&nbsp; The foregoing representations constituted threats, promises and inducements within the meaning of the confessions rule and, when combined with the prevalent ambiguity concerning just what was and was not admissible in court against the accused, as well as the oppressive atmosphere created by the “infallible” polygraph test, they are sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to voluntariness of the accused’s confessions.&nbsp; The combination of the lies and misrepresentations, which are not impermissible, with the inducements, which are, caused the accused to make involuntary admissions.&nbsp; At the very least, the trial judge had to have a reasonable doubt about the application of the classic voluntariness rule. </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In addition, the statements are inadmissible on the basis that the manner in which they were obtained by the police places the accused in the unfair position of having to lead prejudicial, unreliable and inadmissible evidence against himself in order to impeach the veracity of the statements obtained.&nbsp; The admission into evidence of a confession, given in circumstances where it is intimately linked to a “failed” polygraph test, as it was in this case, is wholly inconsistent with the holding of this Court in <i>Béland</i> and severely, and unjustifiably, prejudices an accused’s fair trial interests.&nbsp; Since the confession and the polygraph are so intimately linked, the accused will unavoidably have to reveal having failed the polygraph if he wishes to cast doubt on the truthfulness of his confession.&nbsp; This comes at too high a cost to the accused’s fair trial interests.&nbsp; He is forced to incriminate himself by introducing an otherwise inadmissible piece of evidence which cannot help but strengthen what is often the sole evidence against him.&nbsp; Given the unparalleled weight attributed to confessions, the prejudicial effect that flows from an accused’s reference to his “failed” polygraph test is overwhelming.&nbsp; Therefore, confessions should be excluded where, as here, the accused, because of the intimate causal and temporal connection between a “failed” polygraph and a subsequent confession, is unable to demonstrate fully the impact of the circumstances surrounding its making without inevitably introducing the polygraph evidence.</span></p>

Another person had agreed to take a polygraph, but was not examined after the respondent confessed to the crimes.&nbsp; The respondent, after initial doubts, agreed to submit to a test.&nbsp; Around 3:00 p.m. on April 26, 1995, the respondent went to the Wandlyn Motel for the test, according to a prior arrangement.&nbsp; The police audiotaped the events at the motel.&nbsp; Sergeant Taker administered the polygraph test.&nbsp; The respondent was fully advised of his rights to silence, to a lawyer (including the availability of Legal Aid), and to leave at any time.&nbsp; Sergeant Taker also advised him that while Sergeant Taker’s interpretation of the polygraph results was not admissible, anything said by the respondent was admissible.&nbsp; The respondent was given a pamphlet to review, which discussed the polygraph procedures, and he signed a consent form.</p>

Then I can walk out of here and it’s over.”&nbsp; Though Sergeant Taker replied “You can walk out at any time”, the respondent did not leave.</p>

(as she then was), in <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, there are two main strands to this Court’s jurisprudence under the confessions rule.&nbsp; One approach is narrow, excluding statements only where the police held out explicit threats or promises to the accused.&nbsp; The definitive statement of this approach came in <i>Ibrahim v. The King</i>, [1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.), at p. 609:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">It has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 376, and <i>R. v.

The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 553, at pp. 556-57, Laskin C.J. noted that in determining the voluntariness of a confession, courts should be alert to the coercive effect of an “atmosphere of oppression”, even though there was “no inducement held out of hope of advantage or fear of prejudice, and absent any threats of violence or actual violence”; see also <i>R. v. Liew</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 227, at para. 37.&nbsp; Clearly, the confessions rule embraces more than the narrow <i>Ibrahim</i> formulation; instead, it is concerned with voluntariness, broadly understood.</p>

Stillman</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607, <i>R. v.</i> <i>Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, and the related jurisprudence.&nbsp; By contrast, a violation of the confessions rule always warrants exclusion.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">False confessions are particularly likely when the police interrogate particular types of suspects, including suspects who are especially vulnerable as a result of their background, special characteristics, or situation, suspects who have compliant personalities, and, in rare instances, suspects whose personalities make them prone to accept and believe police suggestions made during the course of the interrogation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">And indeed, this is consistent with the reasons of Rand J. in <i>Fitton</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 962:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">The strength of mind and will of the accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the effect of questions or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation of the part they have played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to decide whether what was said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free from the influence of hope or fear aroused by them.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><i>Ward</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>Horvath</i>, <i>supra</i>, similarly recognized the particular circumstances of the suspects that rendered them unable to confess voluntarily: in <i>Ward</i>, the accused’s state of shock, and in <i>Horvath</i>, the psychological fragility that precipitated his hypnosis and “complete emotional disintegration” (p. 400).</p>

J. Furedy and J. Liss in “Countering Confessions Induced by the Polygraph: Of Confessionals and Psychological Rubber Hoses” (1986), 29 <i>Crim. L.Q. </i>91, at p. 104, even if “notes were accurate concerning the <i>content</i> of what was said . . ., the notes cannot reflect the <i>tone</i> of what was said and any body language that may have been employed” (emphasis in original).&nbsp; White, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 153-54, similarly offers four reasons why videotaping is important:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">First, it provides a means by which courts can monitor interrogation practices and thereby enforce the other safeguards.&nbsp; Second, it deters the police from employing interrogation methods likely to lead to untrustworthy confessions.&nbsp; Third, it enables courts to make more informed judgments about whether interrogation practices were likely to lead to an untrustworthy confession.&nbsp; Finally, mandating this safeguard accords with sound public policy because the safeguard will have additional salutary effects besides reducing untrustworthy confessions, including more net benefits for law enforcement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="Section31">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This is not to suggest that non-recorded interrogations are inherently suspect; it is simply to make the obvious point that when a recording is made, it can greatly assist the trier of fact in assessing the confession.</p>

Kalashnikoff</i> (1981), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Lazure</i> (1959), 126 C.C.C. 331 (Ont. C.A.); R. J. Marin, <i>Admissibility of Statements</i> (9th ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 1–15.&nbsp; Intuitively implausible as it may seem, both judicial precedent and academic authority confirm that the pressure of intense and prolonged questioning may convince a suspect that no one will believe his or her protestations of innocence, and that a conviction is inevitable.&nbsp; In these circumstances, holding out the possibility of a reduced charge or sentence in exchange for a confession would raise a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of any ensuing confession.&nbsp; An explicit offer by the police to procure lenient treatment in return for a confession is clearly a very strong inducement, and will warrant exclusion in all but exceptional circumstances.</p>

Ewert</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (B.C.C.A.).&nbsp; In that case, the police made what Hinkson J.A. at the Court of Appeal described as a “bold offer to the accused to help him, in the sense of providing psychiatric help, if he told them what had happened” (p. 216).&nbsp; Reversing the Court of Appeal, this Court upheld the trial judge’s conclusion that, while the police conduct was an inducement, it was not a factor in the suspect’s decision to confess.&nbsp; <i>Ewert</i> thus recognizes the importance of a contextual approach.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Threats come in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; Among the most common are words to the effect that “it would be better” to tell, implying thereby that dire consequences might flow from a refusal to talk.&nbsp; Maule J. recognized this fact, and said that “there can be no doubt that such words, if spoken by a competent person, have been held to exclude a confession at least 500 times” (<i>R. v. Garner</i> (1848), 3 Cox C.C. 175, at p. 177).</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Courts have accordingly excluded confessions made in response to police suggestions that it would be better if they confessed.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Desmeules</i>, [1971] R.L. 505 (Que. Ct. Sess. P.); <i>Comeau v. The Queen</i> (1961), 131 C.C.C. 139 (N.S.S.C.); <i>Lazure</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R. v. Hanlon</i> (1958), 28 C.R. 398 (Nfld.

Puffer</i> (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 81 (Man. C.A.).&nbsp; In that case a suspect in a robbery and murder asked to meet with two police officers of his acquaintance.&nbsp; At this meeting, one officer said:&nbsp; “The best thing you can do is come in with us and tell the truth” (p. 95).&nbsp; Freedman C.J.M. held that while the officer’s language was “unfortunate”, it did not require exclusion (at p. 95): “McFall <i>wanted</i> to talk, he <i>wanted</i> to give the police his version of what had occurred, and above all he did not want Puffer and Kizyma to get away, leaving him to face the music alone” (emphasis in original).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s ruling.&nbsp; See <i>McFall v. The Queen</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 321; see also <i>R. v. Hayes</i> (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 294 (Alta.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Very few confessions are inspired solely by remorse.&nbsp; Often the motives of an accused are mixed and include a hope that an early admission may lead to an earlier release or a lighter sentence.&nbsp; If it were the law that the mere presence of such a motive, even if promoted by something said or done by a person in authority, led inexorably to the exclusion of a confession, nearly every confession would be rendered inadmissible.&nbsp; This is not the law.&nbsp; In some cases the hope may be self-generated.&nbsp; If so, it is irrelevant, even if it provides the dominant motive for making the confession.&nbsp; In such a case the confession will not have been obtained by anything said or done by a person in authority.&nbsp; More commonly the presence of such a hope will, in part at least, owe its origin to something said or done by such a person.&nbsp; There can be few prisoners who are being firmly but fairly questioned in a police station to whom it does not occur that they might be able to bring both their interrogation and their detention to an earlier end by confession.</p>

Shortly thereafter, at about 3:00 a.m., he was awakened for the purpose of interviewing.&nbsp; In the course of the interrogation, the accused nodded off to sleep at least five times.&nbsp; He requested warmer clothes and a tissue to wipe his nose, both of which were refused.&nbsp; While he admitted knowing that he did not have to talk, and that the officers had made no explicit threats or promises, he hoped that if he talked to the police they would give him some warm clothes and cease the interrogation.</p>

12.2pt">[N]either the likelihood that the confession is untrue nor the preservation of the individual’s freedom of will is the sole interest at stake.&nbsp; As we said just last Term, “The abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confessions . . . also turns on the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves.” . . .&nbsp; Thus a complex of values underlies the stricture against use by the state of confessions which, by way of convenient shorthand, this Court terms involuntary, and the role played by each in any situation varies according to the particular circumstances of the case.</p>

Canada</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, at p. 279 (quoting <i>Stein v. The Ship “Kathy K”</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802, at p. 808) (emphasis in <i>Schwartz</i>).</p>

Other tests were administered in July and September 1994, and in January 1995.&nbsp; In all three cases, Sergeant Taker formed the opinion that the subject was telling the truth.&nbsp; See A.R. at pp. 735-54.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:31.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It is interesting to me that this last answer is not very responsive to the real question raised.&nbsp; It suggests that the polygraph is not infallible because it sometimes does not indicate whether the subject is truthful or not, in which case the result may be inconclusive.&nbsp; The answer does not say whether mistakes can be made in identifying liars.&nbsp; In fact, it suggests that no such errors are likely since “[m]ost examinations readily reveal to the polygraphist whether or not the person is truthful”.&nbsp;</p>

See A.R. at pp. 381-89.&nbsp; Further, and more importantly, he repeatedly, though often implicitly, emphasized the polygraph’s infallibility as a lie-detecting instrument:</p>

Marquard</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, at p. 248; <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at p. 23); and on an assessment of the unacceptable cost, in relation to the fairness and efficiency of the trial process, of admitting polygraph evidence (see <i>Mohan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 21).&nbsp; In this regard, McIntyre J. for the majority wrote (at pp. 415-18):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the sole issue upon which the polygraph evidence is adduced is the credibility of the accused, an issue well within the experience of judges and juries and one in which no expert evidence is required.&nbsp; It is a basic tenet of our legal system that judges and juries are capable of assessing credibility and reliability of evidence....</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">What would be served by the introduction of evidence of polygraph readings into the judicial process? To begin with, it must be remembered that however scientific it may be, its use in court depends on the human intervention of the operator.&nbsp; Whatever results are recorded by the polygraph instrument, their nature and significance reach the trier of fact through the mouth of the operator.&nbsp; Human fallibility is therefore present as before, but now it may be said to be fortified with the mystique of science. Then, it may be asked, what does it do?&nbsp; It provides evidence on the issue of credibility of a witness.&nbsp; This has always been a collateral issue and one to be decided by the trier of fact.</p>

Egger</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at p. 474; Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at § 8.87.&nbsp; Given the overwhelming weight that jurors are likely to attribute to confessions, as a simple matter of human intuition, and, relatedly, given the skepticism and suspicion with which they will normally approach the proposition that a person may, absent torture, falsely confess to a serious crime, it must be open to the accused to exhaustively explain any inducements or “discrediting circumstances”, Wigmore, <i>supra</i>, at § 820c, at p. 306, which may cast doubt on its truthfulness.</p>
