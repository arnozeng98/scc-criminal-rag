<div class="Section3">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The accused was charged with second degree murder and tried before a jury.&nbsp; The Crown’s evidence indicated that at least two individuals had been in the hotel room with the victim and there was no dispute that the accused was one of them.&nbsp; Critical to the Crown’s case was the testimony of a jailhouse informant, N, who testified that the accused had told him that he had cleaned the hotel room in order to remove DNA evidence of his presence.&nbsp; The accused acknowledged talking with N but denied speaking with him about DNA, fingerprints, or wiping down surfaces.&nbsp; The trial judge advised the jury to be “extremely cautious” in accepting N’s evidence because he admitted to previous convictions and to having a drug dependence, and advised them that it was “unsafe” and “dangerous” for them to rely on N’s testimony unless they found some support for it in the rest of the evidence.&nbsp; However, he did not tell the jury that caution was required because N was a jailhouse informant, that he was facing charges himself, or that he was aware a reward was offered for information about the killing.&nbsp; The accused was convicted, but the Court of Appeal, in a majority decision, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec </i>warning was inadequate.&nbsp; The Crown then conducted additional forensic testing and DNA analysis which resulted in&nbsp; reports that more of the accused’s DNA was found in the hotel room.&nbsp; The Crown appealed to this Court as of right, and the accused sought to adduce this new evidence.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Held</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">:&nbsp; The fresh evidence should be admitted and the appeal should be dismissed.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A jury, in order to assess the risk of accepting testimony from an unsavoury witness, must understand the reasons for special scrutiny.&nbsp; The characteristics of the witness which bring his or her credibility into serious question must therefore be identified for the jury.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge’s warning did not point out to the jury that they should be cautious with N’s evidence because of his possible motive to lie in order to get some advantage for himself in his own legal troubles or to collect the reward.&nbsp; While it was debatable whether this omission in the judge’s direction was sufficiently serious in the context of this trial so as to require appellate intervention, the new evidence clearly made a new trial necessary.&nbsp; The new evidence met all the relevant criteria for its admission; in particular, it may reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.&nbsp; The Crown effectively conceded in its closing argument to the jury that the accused could not be convicted unless the jury accepted N’s evidence.&nbsp; The new evidence showing the accused’s DNA on three items in the hotel room could have an impact not only on the jury’s assessment of the credibility of N, whose evidence was bolstered by the evidence of cleaning, but also on the portion of the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec </i>warning where he specifically instructed the jury that the absence of DNA evidence in the room could be considered as supporting N’s evidence about his jail cell conversation with the accused.</span></p>

Mr. Hurley testified that after they got to the room Ms. Naistus made a phone call to locate the cocaine.&nbsp; At this point, he was not feeling well and vomited in the toilet in the hotel room.&nbsp; He testified that he used towels to wipe his hands and the top of the toilet.&nbsp; Afterward, when Ms. Naistus advised him her friend would not sell the cocaine, he left the hotel room. <span lang="EN-GB">According to Mr. Hurley, Ms. Naistus was drunk but alive when he left.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

There were important reasons to be concerned about Mr. Niemi’s credibility: he was facing charges himself, he was approached by the police, he was aware there was a reward offered for information about the killing and he made no mention of what he had allegedly heard when first approached by the police.</p>

The evidence of attempts to clean the room could be taken as independent evidence tending to support Mr. Niemi’s evidence about his conversation with Mr. Hurley.&nbsp; In turn, Mr. Niemi’s evidence supported the Crown’s case that Mr. Hurley had not only been there, but also that he was the killer. Thus anything that tended to rebut the room cleaning theory tended to weaken the independent evidence that could be seen as supporting Mr. Niemi’s version of the conversation with Mr. Hurley and, consequently, weakened the Crown’s circumstantial case.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

The trial judge further advised the jury that it was “unsafe” and “dangerous” for them to rely on Mr. Niemi’s testimony unless they found some support for it in the rest of the evidence. These instructions clearly communicated to the jury that it was dangerous to rely on Mr. Niemi’s evidence absent other evidence supporting it.&nbsp; However, the trial judge’s explanation of the reasons for the caution was incomplete.&nbsp; He did not tell the jury that caution was required because Mr. Niemi was a jailhouse informant, that he was facing charges himself, or that he was aware a reward was offered for information about the killing. Although these facts were included in the trial judge’s summary of Mr. Niemi’s evidence, at no point in the jury charge were they linked to the need for extreme caution in relying on his evidence.&nbsp;</p>

Thus, the evidence about cleaning the room was critical to the circumstantial evidence against Mr. Hurley, as the Crown accepted that Mr. Niemi’s evidence was&nbsp;&nbsp; critical to its case.</p>

(3d) 469.&nbsp; In short, the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge’s explanation of <i>why</i> Mr. Niemi’s evidence had to be regarded with care was insufficient, as it failed to flag some important reasons for doing so, namely his knowledge of a reward and the fact he was in custody and facing charges at the time.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify">A truly functional approach [to appellate review of the adequacy of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning] must take into account the dual purpose of the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning: first, to alert the jury to the danger of relying on the unsupported evidence of unsavoury witnesses and to explain the reasons for special scrutiny of their testimony; and second, in appropriate cases, to give the jury the tools necessary to identify evidence capable of enhancing the trustworthiness of those witnesses.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">In order to assess the risk of accepting testimony from an unsavoury witness, a jury must understand the reasons for special scrutiny (<i>R. v. Sauvé </i>(2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont.

The parties disagree about the application of the fourth <i>Palmer</i> factor.&nbsp; The issue is whether the new evidence could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.

The respondent submitted in argument that the new evidence, coupled with the evidence of someone else’s DNA on a cigarette butt inside the Bacardi Breezer bottle, may have had an impact on the outcome of the trial in the following three ways: it could have led to the conclusion that Mr. Hurley was not the last person in the room with Ms. Naistus;&nbsp; it could have cast doubt on the Crown’s theory that the room was cleaned or an attempt was made to clean DNA and fingerprints out of the room, which in turn could have cast doubt on the credibility of Mr. Niemi; and it could have bolstered the credibility of one of the civilian witnesses who testified she saw Ms. Naistus with persons other than Mr. Hurley on the evening Ms. Naistus was killed.</p>

The presence of Mr. Hurley’s DNA on additional items in the room — the ashtray, the cigarette filter, and the bottle cap — could have been interpreted by the jury as casting doubt on the Crown’s theory that Mr. Hurley cleaned the room to avoid detection. Moreover, the fourth <i>Palmer</i> factor requires an assessment of the new evidence in the context of the other evidence adduced at trial.&nbsp; The Crown’s position at trial was that the absence of DNA evidence tended to support the theory that Mr. Hurley cleaned the room to avoid detection.&nbsp; However, it must be remembered that it was clear at trial that some of Mr. Hurley’s DNA was found in the room, for example, on a facecloth.&nbsp; It was open to the jury to think that the finding of this DNA evidence was inconsistent with the Crown’s wiping down theory.&nbsp; It follows that some of the proposed new evidence, which if accepted would reveal that more of Mr. Hurley’s DNA was found in the room, could reasonably be seen to further undermine the Crown’s theory.&nbsp; Of course, these are all factual questions for a jury to determine and the only issue before this Court is whether the new evidence, viewed in the context of the record, could reasonably be expected to have affected the result.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

As noted earlier, the Crown effectively conceded in its closing argument to the jury that Mr. Hurley could not be convicted unless the jury accepted Mr. Niemi’s evidence.</p>

As noted earlier, the trial judge drew the jury’s attention to both the presence and absence of DNA evidence connecting Mr. Hurley to the room and specifically instructed the jury that the absence of such evidence could be considered as supporting Mr. Niemi’s evidence about his jail cell conversation with Mr. Hurley:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">You might consider the DNA found at the scene on the towel [<i>sic</i>] and under the victim’s fingernails tend to identify that the accused was in the room, but he has admitted this. However, <u>this evidence may help convince you that what Mr. Niemi said that the accused told him was evidence of the actions of the accused in room 114</u>. Secondly; <u>the lack of other fingerprints or DNA evidence found at the scene may bolster the evidence of Mr. Niemi when he says the accused told him he wiped down the room</u>. However, you have also heard other explanations as to why there might be no DNA on objects like bottles. And the defence asserts that other human material, like hair, was found and should have been tested and might have provided DNA profiles.</p>

This, as noted, relates directly and significantly to the jury’s assessment of a critical Crown witness.</p>
