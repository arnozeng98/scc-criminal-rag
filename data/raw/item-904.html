The focus of s.&nbsp;181 is on manipulative and injurious false statements of fact disguised as authentic research.&nbsp; The international instruments against national, racial or religious hatred signed by Canada, the various provisions similar to s.&nbsp;181 found in other free and democratic countries, the tragedy of the Holocaust and Canada's commitment to the values of equality and multiculturalism in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec15" target="_blank">ss.&nbsp;15<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and<a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec27" target="_blank"> 27<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> emphasize the importance of s.&nbsp;181's aim.</span></p>

<div class="Section10">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The purpose attributed to s.&nbsp;181 is not new.&nbsp;The predecessors of s.&nbsp;181 were always aimed at preventing the harm caused by false speech and thereby protecting the safety and security of the community.&nbsp;While initially the protection of the public interest from harm focused on the prevention of deliberate slanderous statements against the great nobles of the realm to preserve the security of the state, the purpose has evolved over the years to extend the protections from harm caused by false speech to vulnerable social groups and therefore to safeguard the public interest against social intolerance and public alarm. Thus, rather than creating a new and different purpose, the aim of the section has been maintained. &nbsp;The wording of s.&nbsp;181, however, includes a permissible shift in emphasis with its test which is based on injury to the public interest.&nbsp; Looking back to the inclusion of the offence in the <i>Code</i>, and the last amendment to the section, one can reasonably conclude that there has been a shift in the values that inform the public interest.&nbsp; Since this shift has been incorporated into the language of the section itself, it is therefore permissible.&nbsp; The test of defining "injury . . . to a public interest" takes into account the changing values of Canadian society.&nbsp; Those values encompass multiculturalism and equality, precepts specifically included in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Section&nbsp;181 of the <i>Code</i> is an acceptably proportional response to Parliament's objective.&nbsp; First, there is a rational connection between the suppression of the publication of deliberate and injurious lies and Parliament's objective of protecting society from the harms caused by calculated falsehoods and thereby promoting the security and safety of the community.&nbsp; Where racial and social intolerance is fomented through the deliberate manipulation of people of good faith by unscrupulous fabrications, a limitation on the expression of such speech is rationally connected to its eradication.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Second, s.&nbsp;181 does not unduly infringe the right of freedom of expression.&nbsp;Under s.&nbsp;181, the accused is not judged on the unpopularity of his beliefs. &nbsp;It is only where the deliberate publication of false facts is likely to seriously injure a public interest that the impugned section is invoked.&nbsp; Any uncertainty as to the nature of the speech inures to the benefit of the accused.&nbsp; The infrequent use of s.&nbsp;181 can be attributed to the extremely onerous burden on the Crown to prove each element of the offence.&nbsp; The fact that the section is seldom used, however, should not militate against its usefulness.&nbsp; Further, s.&nbsp;181 is not overly broad.&nbsp; An application of the appropriate criteria makes it possible to draw a coherent distinction between statements of opinion and assertions of fact.&nbsp;When applied to the pamphlet at issue in this case, these criteria indicate that statements couched as "revisionist history" may be taken to be allegations of fact rather than submissions of opinion.&nbsp; The jury, as instructed by the trial judge, was clearly capable of drawing that distinction. While it is true that no theory of history can be proved or disproved, the accused has not been convicted for misinterpreting factual material but for entirely and deliberately misrepresenting its contents, manipulating and fabricating basic facts in order to support his theories.&nbsp; Courts deal with the question of truth and falsity of statements on a daily basis.&nbsp; With reference to reliable historical documents, "historical facts" can also be shown to be true or false in the context of s.&nbsp;181 ‑‑ a section well suited to respond to the harm caused by vilification campaigns disguised as pseudo‑science.&nbsp;Finally, the fact that Parliament has enacted hate propaganda legislation does not invalidate s.&nbsp;181.&nbsp; The government may legitimately employ a variety of measures in order to achieve its objective.&nbsp; Human rights legislation may, in certain circumstances, be sufficient to deal with a particular problem in this area,&nbsp; but the strength of the criminal law is needed and reserved for the extreme cases, such as the case at hand, to send a clear message and&nbsp; to discourage and punish those who knowingly publish falsehoods that are likely to injure a public interest.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Section 181 dates from the Statute of Westminster in 1275, which introduced the offence <i>De Scandalis Magnatum</i> or <i>Scandalum Magnatum</i>.&nbsp; It provided "[t]hat from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any false News or Tales, whereby discord, or occasion of discord or slander may grow between the King and his People, or the Great Men of the Realm".&nbsp; The criminal offence was enforced by the King's Council, and later by the Court of Star Chamber, until the 17th century when its enforcement was taken over by the common law courts.&nbsp; It had as its primary aim the prevention of "false statements which, in a society dominated by extremely powerful landowners, could threaten the security of the state": see <i>R. v. Keegstra</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 722, <i>per</i> Dickson C.J.; and F. R. Scott, "Publishing False News" (1952), 30 <i>Can. Bar Rev.</i> 37, at pp. 38-39.&nbsp; As Holdsworth recounts, "[t]his was no vain fear at a time when the offended great one was only too ready to resort to arms to redress a fancied injury": <i>A History of English Law</i> (5th ed. 1942), vol. III, at p. 409.&nbsp; Nonetheless, <i>De Scandalis Magnatum</i> is not thought to have been a very effective instrument.&nbsp; Holdsworth refers to a "thin stream of . . . cases" from the 16th century onwards; by the time of its repeal in 1887 (<i>Statute Law Revision Act</i>, 1887 (U.K.), 50 &amp; 51 Vict., c. 59) it had long been obsolete.</span></p>

<div class="Section22">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">With the greatest respect, I find no support in the history of the provision for such a conclusion.&nbsp; The only lesson to be gleaned from the history of s. 181 is that the offence was aimed at protecting the rule of law and the security of the state, in the guise of the head of power whether that be the monarchy or later the government: see Drouin J. in <i>R. v. Carrier</i> (1951), 16 C.R. 18, 104 C.C.C. 75 (Que. K.B. (Criminal Side)).&nbsp; The fact that provocative racial statements have been, on the odd occasion in the past two hundred years, prosecuted as other criminal offences such as "public mischief" and "criminal libel" sheds no light on the objective behind the enactment of the "false news" provision.&nbsp; Moreover, as discussed below, the very cases referred to by Cory and Iacobucci JJ. to support their conclusions actually reveal the overinclusiveness of the provision.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">I turn from history to the wording of s. 181 and the ambit of the section upon whose constitutionality this Court is asked to pronounce.&nbsp; The construction of s. 181 is not at issue in these proceedings, leave to appeal on those issues having been denied.&nbsp; The analysis of the constitutionality of s. 181 must therefore be based on the section as it was interpreted by the courts below.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Each of the three elements of the offence created by s. 181 is capable of giving rise to considerable difficulty of application in the context of a trial.&nbsp; The question of falsity of a statement is often a matter of debate, particularly where historical facts are at issue. (Historians have written extensively on the difficulty of ascertaining what actually occurred in the past, given the difficulty of verification and the selective and sometimes revisionist versions different witnesses and historians may accord to the same events; see, for example, the now famous treatise of E. H. Carr, <i>What is History?</i> (1961)).&nbsp; The element of the accused's knowledge of falsity compounds the problem, adding the need to draw a conclusion about the accused's subjective belief as to the truth or falsity of the statements.&nbsp; Finally, the issue of whether a statement causes or is likely to cause injury or mischief to the public interest requires the identification of a public interest and a determination of whether it has been or is likely to be injured.&nbsp; In the case of each of the three elements of the offence, the not inconsiderable epistemological and factual problems are left for resolution by the jury under the rubric of "fact".&nbsp; Thus, both in its breadth and in the nature of the criteria it posits, s. 181 poses difficulties not usually associated with criminal prohibitions, which traditionally demand no more of a jury than common sense inferences from concrete findings on matters patent to the senses.</span></p>

<div class="Section25">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Difficulties were encountered at trial with respect to all three elements of the offence -- with respect to what constitutes a "statement, tale or news", interpreted as constituting an assertion of fact as opposed to opinion; what constitutes injury or mischief to a public interest; and what constitutes proof of knowledge of falsity of the statement.&nbsp; The courts below resolved the difficult issue of the distinction between a statement and an opinion by treating it as a question of fact for the jury to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this is true in a technical legal sense, in a practical sense the jury was told that the publication at issue was a false statement. By applying the doctrine of judicial notice and telling the jury that "[t]he mass murder and extermination of Jews in Europe by the Nazi regime" was an (historical) fact no "reasonable person" could dispute, the judge effectively settled the issue for them.&nbsp; Moreover, I am unable to agree with my colleagues (see p. 000) that the trial judge instructed the jury that the "onus of differentiating fact from opinion" lay with the Crown.&nbsp; Judge Thomas's direction that the Crown must prove "that the pamphlet, in essence, is a false statement of fact" does not impose upon the Crown the more difficult burden of first explaining to and then convincing a jury of the distinction between historical fact and historical opinion regarding events almost fifty years old.&nbsp; This might be forgiven, given the elusiveness of distinguishing historical fact from historical opinion.&nbsp; But it shows the danger in criminalizing "false statements".&nbsp; The contention is that expressions of opinion are not caught by s. 181.&nbsp; The reality is that when the matter is one on which the majority of the public has settled views, opinions may, for all practical purposes, be treated as an expression of a "false fact".</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The question of knowledge of falsity was similarly left as a question of fact for the jury to decide.&nbsp; But this too was not a question of fact in the usual sense.&nbsp; The jury was instructed that it was entitled to infer from the judge's instruction that because the Holocaust must be regarded as proven, the accused must have known it to be proven and must be taken to have published his pamphlet deliberately for personal motives, knowing the falsity of his assertion to the contrary.&nbsp; Judge Thomas added, albeit as only one factor in this assessment, the principle that the "more unreasonable the belief, the easier it is to draw the inference that the belief is not honestly held".&nbsp; In the context of a sexual assault trial such an instruction would be unlikely to mislead the jury, both because questions of consent and perceptions of consent are far more common place than questions of the sincerity of an accused's belief in esoteric or outlandish historical "facts", and because the jury is likely to have the assistance of the <i>viva voce</i> evidence of both the complainant and accused in determining whether the inference that the accused's unreasonable belief in the complainant's consent was not an honest one ought to be drawn. But in the context of a prosecution under s. 181 a jury is, in the face of such instructions, unlikely to be able to evaluate or accept the accused's assertion that he believed the truth of his publications.&nbsp; The logic is ineluctable: everyone knows this is false; therefore the defendant must have known it was false.</span></p>

<div class="Section26">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">On the final question of injury or mischief to a public interest, the trial judge told the jury that it was sufficient if there is a likelihood of injury or mischief to a particular public interest and directed the jury on the "cancerous effect of racial and religious defamation upon society's interest in the maintenance of racial and religious harmony in Canada."&nbsp; Judge Thomas further instructed the jury that "[t]here can be no doubt . . . that the maintenance of racial and religious tolerance is certainly a matter of public interest in Canada".&nbsp; Once again, the jury's conclusion may have flowed inevitably from the trial judge's instruction.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">One is thus driven to conclude that this was not a criminal trial in the usual sense.&nbsp; The verdict flowed inevitably from the indisputable fact of the publication of the pamphlet, its contents' divergence from the accepted history of the Holocaust, and the public interest in maintaining racial and religious tolerance.&nbsp; There was little practical possibility of showing that the publication was an expression of opinion, nor of showing that the accused did not know it to be false, nor of showing that it would not cause injury or mischief to a public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fault lies not with the trial judge or the jury, who doubtless did their best responsibly to inform the vague words of s. 181 with meaningful content.&nbsp; The fault lies rather in concepts as vague as fact versus opinion or truth versus falsity in the context of history, and the likelihood of "mischief" to the "public interest".</span></p>

<div class="Section29">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The purpose of the guarantee is to permit free expression to the end of promoting truth, political or social participation, and self-fulfilment.&nbsp; That purpose extends to the protection of minority beliefs which the majority regard as wrong or false: <i>Irwin Toy</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 968.&nbsp; Tests of free expression frequently involve a contest between the majoritarian view of what is true or right and an unpopular minority view.&nbsp; As Holmes J. stated over sixty years ago, the fact that the particular content of a person's speech might "excite popular prejudice" is no reason to deny it protection for "if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought -- not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate": <i>United States v. Schwimmer</i>, 279 U.S. 644 (1929), at pp. 654-55.&nbsp; Thus the guarantee of freedom of expression serves to protect the right of the minority to express its view, however unpopular it may be; adapted to this context, it serves to preclude the majority's perception of `truth' or `public interest' from smothering the minority's perception.&nbsp; The view of the majority has no need of constitutional protection; it is tolerated in any event.&nbsp; Viewed thus, a law which forbids expression of a minority or "false" view on pain of criminal prosecution and imprisonment, on its face, offends the purpose of the guarantee of free expression.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Two arguments are advanced.&nbsp; The first is that a deliberate lie constitutes an illegitimate "form" of expression, which, like a violent act, is not protected.&nbsp; A similar argument was advanced and rejected with respect to hate literature in <i>Keegstra</i> on the ground that "form" in <i>Irwin Toy</i> refers to the <u>physical</u> form in which the message is communicated and does not extend to its content.&nbsp; The same point is determinative of the argument in this case.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The second argument advanced is that the appellant's publication is not protected because it serves none of the values underlying s. 2(<i>b</i>).&nbsp; A deliberate lie, it is said, does not promote truth, political or social participation, or self-fulfilment.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not deserving of protection.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart from the fact that acceptance of this argument would require this Court to depart from its view that the content of a statement should not determine whether it falls within s. 2(<i>b</i>), the submission presents two difficulties which are, in my view, insurmountable.&nbsp; The first stems from the difficulty of concluding categorically that all deliberate lies are entirely unrelated to the values underlying <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec2" target="_blank">s. 2(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec2" target="_blank">b<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec2" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The second lies in the difficulty of determining the meaning of a statement and whether it is false.</span></p>

<div class="Section31">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The first difficulty results from the premise that deliberate lies can never have value.&nbsp; Exaggeration -- even clear falsification -- may arguably serve useful social purposes linked to the values underlying freedom of expression.&nbsp; A person fighting cruelty against animals may knowingly cite false statistics in pursuit of his or her beliefs and with the purpose of communicating a more fundamental message, e.g., `cruelty to animals is increasing and must be stopped'.&nbsp; A doctor, in order to persuade people to be inoculated against a burgeoning epidemic, may exaggerate the number or geographical location of persons potentially infected with the virus.&nbsp; An artist, for artistic purposes, may make a statement that a particular society considers both an assertion of fact and a manifestly deliberate lie; consider the case of Salman Rushdie's <i>Satanic Verses</i>, viewed by many Muslim societies as perpetrating deliberate lies against the Prophet.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">All of this expression arguably has intrinsic value in fostering political participation and individual self-fulfilment.&nbsp; To accept the proposition that deliberate lies can never fall under s. 2(<i>b</i>) would be to exclude statements such as the examples above from the possibility of constitutional protection.&nbsp; I cannot accept that such was the intention of the framers of the Constitution.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Indeed, the very cases relied upon by Cory and Iacobucci JJ. to support their position reveal the potential of s. 181 for suppressing valuable political criticism or satire.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Hoaglin</i> (1907), 12 C.C.C. 226 (N.W.T.S.C.), cited at p. 000 of their judgment, the "false" publication asserted "Americans not wanted in Canada".&nbsp; The injury to public interest was, in the words of Harvey J., that "if [Americans] investigate they will find conditions such as to prevent them investing and taking up homesteads" (<i>Hoaglin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 228).&nbsp; Even if one accepts the finding that the statement was undoubtedly "false", it arguably represented a valuable contribution to political debate on Canadian immigration policy.&nbsp; Yet the accused was convicted for publication of such statements contrary to s. 136 (now s. 181).&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>R. v. Kirby</i> (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 286 (Que. C.A.), a case involving prosecution for publication of political satire in the Montreal Gazette (cited at p. 000 of their judgment), Hyde J.A. accepted that the publication fell within the satirical tradition of Chaucer, Swift and Addison.&nbsp; In reversing the trial judge's conviction, he observed that the section may capture "pranks" and that the "prank" in question was "very close to the border" (p. 290).</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The second difficulty lies in the assumption that we can identify the essence of the communication and determine that it is false with sufficient accuracy to make falsity a fair criterion for denial of constitutional protection.&nbsp; In approaching this question, we must bear in mind that tests which involve interpretation and balancing of conflicting values and interests,&nbsp; while useful under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec1" target="_blank">s. 1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, can be unfair if used to deny <i>prima facie</i> protection.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">One problem lies in determining the meaning which is to be judged to be true or false. &nbsp;A given expression may offer many meanings, some which seem false, others, of a metaphorical or allegorical nature, which may possess some validity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, meaning is not a datum so much as an interactive process, depending on the listener as well as the speaker.&nbsp; Different people may draw from the same statement different meanings at different times.&nbsp; The guarantee of freedom of expression seeks to protect not only the meaning intended to be communicated by the publisher but also the meaning or meanings understood by the reader: <i>Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 712, at p. 767, and <i>Irwin Toy</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 976.&nbsp; The result is that a statement that is true on one level or for one person may be false on another level for a different person.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">I turn first to the state's interest in prohibiting the expression here at issue -- the question of whether the Crown has established an overriding public objective, to use the language of <i>R. v. Oakes</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103.&nbsp; In determining the objective of a legislative measure for the purposes of s. 1, the Court must look at the intention of Parliament when the section was enacted or amended.&nbsp; It cannot assign objectives, nor invent new ones according to the perceived current utility of the impugned provision: see <i>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 334, in which this Court rejected the U.S. doctrine of shifting purposes.&nbsp; Although the application and interpretation of objectives may vary over time (see, e.g., <i>Butler</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>per</i> Sopinka J., at pp. 494-96), new and altogether different purposes should not be invented.&nbsp; The case is quite different from the anti-obscenity legislation in <i>Butler</i> where the goal historically and to the present day is the same -- combatting the "detrimental impact" of obscene materials on individuals and society -- even though our understanding or conception of that detrimental impact (a "permissible shift in emphasis") may have evolved, as Sopinka J. noted.&nbsp; My colleagues say that it is a permissible shift in emphasis that the false news provision was originally focused on the "prevention of deliberate slanderous statements against the great nobles of the realm" and is now said to be concerned with "attacks on religious, racial or ethnic minorities" (see p. 000).&nbsp; But this is no shift in emphasis with regard to the purpose of the legislation -- this is an outright redefinition not only of the purpose of the prohibition but also of the nature of the activity prohibited.&nbsp; To convert s. 181 into a provision directed at encouraging racial harmony is to go beyond any permissible shift in emphasis and effectively rewrite the section.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">It is argued that this interpretation represents a mere shift in emphasis because the thrust of s. 181 and its predecessors, like the obscenity provisions in <i>Butler</i>, disclosed a single goal: "the protection of the public interest from harm" or from that which would "threaten the integrity of the social fabric" (the reasons of Cory and Iacobucci JJ., at p. 000 ). Yet, all <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> provisions -- as well as much statutory regulation in the public and private law spheres -- have as their basic purpose the protection of the public from harm and the maintenance of the integrity of the social fabric.&nbsp; Indeed, one might argue that such was the goal of the obscenity provisions under review in <i>Butler</i>, yet the Court did not adopt that as the legislation's objective.&nbsp; Instead, it relied upon a specific objective concerning the effect of pornographic materials on individuals and the resultant impact on society.&nbsp; If the simple identification of the (content-free) goal of protecting the public from harm constitutes a "pressing and substantial" objective, virtually any law will meet the first part of the onus imposed upon the Crown under s. 1.&nbsp; I cannot believe that the framers of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> intended s. 1 to be applied in such a manner.&nbsp; Justification under s. 1 requires more than the general goal of protection from harm common to all criminal legislation; it requires a specific purpose so pressing and substantial as to be capable of overriding the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>'s guarantees.&nbsp; To apply the language used by Sopinka J. in <i>Butler</i> (at p. 496); s. 181 cannot be said to be directed to avoidance of publications which "seriously offend the values fundamental to our society", nor is it directed to a "substantial concern which justifies restricting the otherwise full exercise of the freedom of expression".</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The difficulty in assigning an objective to s. 181 lies in two factors: the absence of any documentation explaining why s. 181 was enacted and retained and the absence of any specific purpose disclosed on the face of the provision.&nbsp; We know that its original purpose in the 13th century was to preserve political harmony in the state by preventing people from making false allegations against the monarch and others in power.&nbsp; This ostensibly remained the purpose through to the 19th century.&nbsp; However, in the 20th century, Parliament removed the offence from the political "Sedition" section of the <i>Code</i> and placed it in the "Nuisance" section, suggesting that Parliament no longer saw it as serving a political purpose. It is to be further noted that it does not appear in that part of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> dedicated to "Offences Against the Person and Reputation", in which both the hate propaganda and defamatory libel provisions appear.&nbsp; Beyond this all is speculation. No Parliamentary committees commented on the matter; no debates considered it.&nbsp; Nor do the vague, general words employed in the text of s. 181 offer insight into what purpose Parliament might have had in mind in enacting and retaining it.</span></p>

(<i>per</i> Dickson C.J. in <i>Keegstra</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 725).&nbsp; The evil addressed was hate-mongering, particularly in the racial context.&nbsp; The provision at issue on this appeal is quite different.&nbsp; Parliament has identified no social problem, much less one of pressing concern, justifying <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec181" target="_blank">s. 181<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; To suggest that the objective of s. 181 is to combat hate propaganda or racism is to go beyond its history and its wording and to adopt the "shifting purpose" analysis this Court has rejected.&nbsp; Such an objective, moreover, hardly seems capable of being described as a "nuisance", the rubric under which Parliament has placed s. 181, nor as the offence's target of mere "mischief" to a public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The lack of any ostensible purpose for s. 181 led the Law Reform Commission in 1986 (Working Paper 50: <i>Hate Propaganda</i>) to recommend repeal of the section, labelling it as "anachronistic", a conclusion which flies in the face of the suggestion that s. 181 is directed to a pressing and substantial social concern.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that no suggestion has been made before this Court that Canada's obligations under the international human rights conventions to which it is a signatory require the enactment of any provision(s) other than that section which was under review in <i>Keegstra</i>: s. 319.&nbsp; The retention of s. 181 is not therefore necessary to fulfil any international obligation undertaken by Parliament.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The phrase "statement, tale or news", while it may not extend to the realm of true opinion (wherever the line is to be drawn, itself a question of great difficulty), obviously encompasses a broad range of historical and social speech, going well beyond what is patent or provable to the senses as a matter of "pure fact". Indeed, one of the cases relied upon in support of the proposition that the section deals only with statements of fact and not with expressions of opinion, <i>R. v. Hoaglin</i>, <i>supra</i>, demonstrates just how slippery the distinction may be. If the expression in issue in that case, in which a disaffected American settler in Alberta had printed posters which stated "Americans not wanted in Canada; investigate before buying land or taking homesteads in this country" is an example of a "false statement of fact" falling within the prohibition, one shudders to consider what other comments might be so construed. Nor are the difficulties confined to determining what is a factual assertion as opposed to an expression of opinion.&nbsp; What is false may, as the case on appeal illustrates, be determined by reference to what is generally (or, as in <i>Hoaglin</i>, officially) accepted as true, with the result that the knowledge of falsity required for guilt may be inferred from the impugned expression's divergence from prevailing or officially accepted beliefs.&nbsp; This makes possible conviction for virtually any statement which does not accord with currently accepted "truths", and lends force to the argument that the section could be used (or abused) in a circular fashion essentially to permit the prosecution of unpopular ideas.&nbsp; Particularly with regard to the historical fact -- historical opinion dichotomy, we cannot be mindful enough both of the evolving concept of history and of its manipulation in the past to promote and perpetuate certain messages.&nbsp; The danger is not confined to totalitarian states like the Nazi regime in Germany or certain communist regimes of the past which blatantly rewrote history.&nbsp; We in Canada need look no further than the `not so noble savage' portrayal of Native Canadians in our children's history text books in the early part of this century.&nbsp; Similarly, in the United States, one finds the ongoing revision of the historical representation of African Americans, whose contribution to aspects of the history of the United States, such as their contribution to the North's victory in the Civil War, is only now being recognized.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">But perhaps the greatest danger of s. 181 lies in the undefined and virtually unlimited reach of the phrase "injury or mischief to a public interest".&nbsp; Neither the respondent nor its supporting interveners has proffered any case law in which this phrase has been applied to a given factual circumstance in a clear and consistent manner.&nbsp; My colleagues refer to the "serious harm" and "serious injury" caused by deliberate falsehoods, but this begs the question of what sort or degree of harm is necessary in order to bring the section into play. Indeed, the limited jurisprudence on s. 181 evidences conflicting opinions on what constitutes a threatened or injured "public interest" justifying criminal sanction.&nbsp; It is difficult to see how a broad, undefined phrase such as "public interest" can on its face constitute a restrained, appropriately limited measure which impairs the right infringed to the minimum degree consistent with securing the legislation's objectives.&nbsp; Any deliberate lie (potentially defined as that which does not accord with accepted truth), which causes or is likely to cause "injury" or&nbsp; "mischief" to any "public interest" is within the potential reach of the section.&nbsp; The interpretation given to "public interest" in this case may not have been objectionable.&nbsp; But that is not the issue in determining whether a legislative restriction of rights is overbroad.&nbsp; The issue is whether the provision permits the state to restrict constitutional rights in circumstances and ways that may not be justifiable.&nbsp; The vague and broad wording of s. 181 leaves open that possibility.</span></p>

In so doing my colleagues have arguably created a new offence, an offence hitherto unknown to the criminal law. The promotion of equality and multiculturalism is a laudable goal, but, with respect, I can see no basis in the history or language of s. 181 to suggest that it is the motivating goal behind its enactment or retention. To import it is to engage not in a valid process of statutory interpretation, but in impermissible reading in of content foreign to the enactment; <i>Salituro</i>, <i>Slaight</i> and <i>Hills</i> were never intended to be taken this far.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In the 1970's and 1980's, the appellant published and distributed white supremacist literature, videos and paraphernalia through the auspices of his Toronto publishing house, Samisdat Publishers Ltd.&nbsp; He was charged with two counts of spreading false news in contravention of what is now s. 181 of the <i>Code</i> for publishing two pamphlets.&nbsp; He was acquitted at trial on the count relating to the publication of the pamphlet, <i>The West, War and Islam!</i>, but was convicted on the count relating to a pamphlet entitled, <i>Did Six Million Really Die?</i>&nbsp; It is this conviction which he appeals to this Court.</span></p>

<div class="Section58">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Because much of the reasoning in this case turns on whether the expression in question purports to be a statement of fact or of mere opinion, and because it is difficult to comprehend fully the significance of harmful speech in the abstract, the pamphlet warrants more than a general reference in order to make clear the precise nature of the publication at issue.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The pamphlet is part of the genre of anti-Semitic literature known euphemistically as "revisionist history".&nbsp; The pamphlet indicates the author is "Richard Harwood . . . a writer and specialist in political and diplomatic aspects of the Second World War.&nbsp; At present he is with the University of London".&nbsp; However, the piece appears to have actually been produced in England by Richard Verral, editor of the neo-nazi British National Front newspaper in 1977.&nbsp; The appellant has added a preface and afterword to the original document, entitled <i>Historical Fact No. 1, Did Six Million Really Die?&nbsp; Truth at Last Exposed</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The basic gist of the piece is that the Holocaust perpetrated by the German National Socialists against the Jews of Europe during the Second World War never occurred.&nbsp; According to the appellant, there was no concerted plan to exterminate European Jewry, along with assorted others of racial extraction, religious persuasion, national origin or sexual orientation of which the Nazis did not approve.&nbsp; By pointing to what he alleges to be new evidence, the appellant submits that some Jews died, as people will in war time, but that the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" was never anything more than a plan to facilitate emigration to Madagascar.&nbsp; He states that the Holocaust is a myth fabricated by an immensely powerful Jewish-Zionist conspiracy to win lucrative war reparations from the Germans, to make them feel ashamed and a pariah in the eyes of other nations, and to win political and economic support for the State of Israel.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">While the appellant argues that his purpose in preparing and disseminating the publication was to provide a novel analysis of historical documents,&nbsp; Richard Verral makes clear the true import of the "revisionist" project.&nbsp; In the aftermath of the Holocaust, the international community has cast a jaundiced eye on all forms of racism and has bonded together to reject and obliterate it.&nbsp; The author alleges that "the Anglo-Saxon world" is falling into decline because of the presence of non-Aryans and that the lessons of the horrors of the Holocaust prevent&nbsp; "rational" debate about this trend.&nbsp; Under the heading "The Race Problem Suppressed", the pamphlet states:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Thus the accusation of the Six Million is not only used to undermine the principle of nationhood and national pride, but it threatens the survival of the Race itself. . . .&nbsp; Many countries of the Anglo-Saxon world, notably Britain and America, are today facing the gravest danger in their history, the danger posed by the alien races in their midst.&nbsp; Unless something is done in Britain to halt the immigration and assimilation of Africans and Asians into our country, we are faced in the near future, quite apart from the bloodshed of racial conflict, with the biological alteration and destruction of the British people as they have existed here since the coming of the Saxons. &nbsp;In short, we are threatened with the irrecoverable loss of our European culture and racial heritage.&nbsp; But what happens if a man dares to speak of the race problem, of its biological and political implications? He is branded as that most heinous of creatures, a "racialist".&nbsp; And what is racialism, of course, but the very hallmark of the Nazi!&nbsp; They (so everyone is told, anyway) murdered Six Million Jews because of racialism, so it must be a very evil thing indeed.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The mass murder and extermination of Jews in Europe by the Nazi regime during the Second World War is so generally known and accepted that it could not reasonably be questioned by reasonable persons.&nbsp; I directed you then and I direct you now that you will accept that as a fact.&nbsp; The Crown was not required to prove it.&nbsp; It was in the light of that direction that you should examine the evidence in this case and the issues before you.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Finally, the presence of existing hate propaganda legislation should not weigh against either the need for or the validity of s. 181.&nbsp; It was argued that s.&nbsp;181 was a mere duplication of the hate provisions of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and thus was invalid.&nbsp; Such an argument should not be accepted.&nbsp; There are numerous provisions of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> which overlap to some extent but which are nonetheless valid.&nbsp; For example, <i>Johnson v. The Queen</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 160, dealt with a charge under then s.&nbsp;163(2) of the <i>Code</i> prohibiting the taking part in an "immoral, indecent or obscene" performance.&nbsp; This Court found that it was irrelevant that Parliament had enacted a separate offence of being nude in a public place.&nbsp; Nudity, it was noted, was not the sole factor in determining whether the performance was immoral.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Similarly, the fact that Parliament has enacted hate propaganda legislation does not invalidate s. 181.&nbsp; The section seeks to discourage the public dissemination of injurious falsehoods.&nbsp; These statements of fact, it should be remembered, are known by the accused to be lies.&nbsp; There is a pervasive and pernicious air of evil that surrounds their conscious aim to manipulate people.&nbsp; The deceptive nature of the deliberate publication of false statements of fact may, in certain circumstances, be even more invidious than the publication of hateful opinions which at least expresses the beliefs of the publisher.&nbsp; Thus s. 181 still fulfils an important role in a multicultural and democratic society.&nbsp; It emphasizes the repugnance of Canadian society for the wilful publication of known falsehoods that cause injury to the public interest through their attacks upon groups identifiable under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec15" target="_blank">s. 15<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> and therefore on society as a whole.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">As Dickson C.J. stressed in <i>Keegstra</i>, the government may legitimately employ a variety of measures in order to achieve its objective.&nbsp; On a general level, the promotion of racial and social tolerance and the prevention of harm caused by injurious and calculated falsehoods is best achieved through information and education.&nbsp; Human rights legislation may, in certain circumstances, be sufficient to deal with a particular problem in this area.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the strength of the criminal law must be reserved for the extreme cases, such as the case at hand.&nbsp; In a case such as this, with its potential to cause serious injury to the public interest, it is necessary to send a clear message by repudiating the harm caused by the appellant.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">For example, it is true that driver education and the penalties provided by the <i>Highway Traffic Acts</i> may suffice to regulate most drivers.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the criminal law is used to demonstrate society's repugnance for the drunken driver who is likely to injure others. &nbsp;So too the criminal law has an important role to play in discouraging and punishing those who knowingly publish falsehoods that are likely to injure a public interest. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Overall, it would be hard to imagine a measure that would constitute a lesser impairment of a type of expression that is on the extreme periphery of the protected right.&nbsp; We therefore conclude that s. 181 does not unduly infringe the right to freedom of expression.</span></p>
