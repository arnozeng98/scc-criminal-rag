(dissenting):&nbsp; The curative proviso has no application.&nbsp; The trial judge did not intervene or otherwise express any concern about (or even awareness of) the impropriety of evidence of bad character led by the prosecution.&nbsp; The majority in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal concluded that “the inadmissible evidence was no mere inadvertent slip.&nbsp; It went on for some pages in the transcript.&nbsp; It included evidence that the accused was known to the police to be involved in the very type of offence before the court.”</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown conceded that the DNA evidence did not, on its own, establish O’s culpability. &nbsp;An inferential leap had still to be made from a finding that the accused once came into contact with the mask to a finding that he actually donned the mask on the date in question to commit the robbery.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burden on the Crown seeking to invoke the curative proviso is a substantially higher one than the requirement that the Crown prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.&nbsp; Important deficiencies in trial reasons cannot be excused on the basis that trial judges are presumed to know the law.&nbsp; Here, the trial judge’s use of the word “entirely” in relation to the DNA evidence just reflects the fact that there was no other identification evidence before him.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the admission of the character evidence was not harmless, since it could well have predisposed the trial judge to uncritical acceptance of the DNA evidence.&nbsp; If the judge had intended by the word “entirely” to distance himself from the inadmissible evidence, he would have said so.&nbsp; This is not a case where, despite any prejudice caused by the trial judge’s error of law, the evidence against O was so overwhelming that a guilty verdict would necessarily be the outcome of a new trial.</span></p>

Leaney</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393, at pp. 415-16, where she noted that when a trial judge expressly arrives at a conclusion on the critical issue “independently of the inadmissible evidence . . . no unfairness can be said to arise, nor has there been a miscarriage of justice” (see also <i>R. v.

Mars</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Ont. C.A.), where Doherty J.A., dealing with fingerprint evidence, wrote:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fingerprint evidence will almost always afford cogent evidence that the person whose fingerprint is left on the object touched that object.&nbsp; However, the ability of the fingerprint evidence to connect an accused to the crime charged will depend on whether there is <u>other evidence capable of establishing that the accused touched the object at the relevant time and place so as to connect the accused to the crime</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; para. 19.]</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">See also <i>R. v. D.D.T.</i>, 2009 ONCA 918, 257 O.A.C. 258.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Samuels</i>, 2009 ONCA 719 (CanLII), by contrast, <i>Mars</i> was distinguished on the basis that there <i>was</i> “other evidence” linking the accused to the crime (para. 17).</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence of the appellant’s DNA on the mask is equivalent to a fingerprint.&nbsp; The Crown’s expert testified that only small amounts of DNA are sufficient, and can be present for years.&nbsp; In addition, the thrust of the Crown’s expert evidence was that DNA can be transferred or deposited by handling. [para. 25]</span></p>

Sheppard</i>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, and should be rejected here as well.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[42]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The Crown invokes <i>R. v. Leaney</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393.&nbsp; In that case, inadmissible opinion evidence was received from police officers but the curative proviso was nevertheless applied, <i>per</i> McLachlin J., at p. 415:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:62.65pt;text-indent:-62.65pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the trial judge’s clear statement that he arrived at his conclusion as to identify <u>independently of the evidence of the police officers</u>, their evidence assumes the character of mere surplusage, which does not vitiate the judge’s conclusion that Leaney was one of persons shown on the video screen.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, there is a significant difference between appellate tolerance of inadmissible opinion evidence in circumstances where the trial judge found that the opinion evidence was <i>unnecessary</i> to enable him to appreciate what he could see with his own eyes on a video (and the inadmissible opinions thus characterized as “mere surplusage”) and <i>prejudicial</i> evidence of bad character.&nbsp; The content of the officers’ testimony in <i>Leaney</i> was itself unobjectionable.&nbsp; The problem was that it was not their place to utter it.&nbsp; Here, in contrast, it is the information itself, and not just its source, that is objectionable.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[43]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the Crown should not have the benefit of the curative proviso because the trial judge’s reasons demonstrated no awareness of the problem of the police testimony.&nbsp; The situation, and thus the outcome, was different in <i>R. v. Rahm</i>, 2006 ABCA 111, 384 A.R. 341, where Conrad J.A. held:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:62.65pt;text-indent:-62.65pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are troubled by the prosecutor’s persistent line of questions relating to bad character but, in the end, we are satisfied that no miscarriage of justice resulted from the introduction of this character evidence.&nbsp; This was not a jury case.&nbsp; <u>During the course of the trial, the trial judge made it clear that he understood that bad character was not admissible where character had not been placed in issue.</u> <b>&nbsp;</b>[Emphasis added; para. 13.]</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">No such understanding is evident in the trial reasons in this case.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In these circumstances, I do not believe that the trial judge’s error of law can be dismissed as “harmless”, and, unless we can make an affirmative finding to that effect, the respondent is entitled to a new trial.</span></p>

 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">In my view, the Crown cannot establish that its case against the respondent was “overwhelming”.</span></p>
