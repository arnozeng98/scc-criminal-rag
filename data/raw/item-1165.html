So they're always tryin' a' think out a' me ... And every time I say somethin', unless I been asked a question, I can't think above them . . . we're both bein' punished", and "I managed to, ah, come up with this idea to walk backwards to New Brunswick . . . That would exercise me back to normal".&nbsp; When asked whether he had been forced to say anything, the appellant indicated that he was uncertain whether he had been manipulated into it in that "somebody maybe plotted murder in this life and they picked me to do it for them, right?".&nbsp; The appellant also stated that he had always wanted to die, but that he had never been able to and that he intended to stay on his tippy-toes regardless of whether anyone liked it.</span></p>

Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, the Court of Appeal found that the appellant knew the events and circumstances which he wished to relay to police, so that his statement was the product of an operating mind.&nbsp; At the objective level, the court concluded that the police officers cautioned the appellant as to his right to counsel and to silence on numerous occasions and were not aware of any internal compulsion acting upon the appellant.</span></p>

He knew that it was being taped and that it could appear at some future trial.&nbsp; He is not naive and he is not stupid so he would know that; but my point is that he just didn't care about that because he was driven to say all these things regardless.&nbsp; If he was going to die, it didn't matter.&nbsp; He made that observation.&nbsp; So, that is a mental element, I think, of great significance.</span></p>
