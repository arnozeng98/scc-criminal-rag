At trial, the complainant&nbsp;testified that the accused, a complete stranger to her, gained entry to her apartment early one morning by pretending to be a friend of her roommate. When the complainant asked him to leave under threat of screaming, the accused put one hand over her mouth and with the other hand took hold of her hair, pulled her away from the door and forced her to the floor. He threatened her, struck her once in order to ensure her submission and then sexually assaulted her. The complainant was terrified and lay still, afraid that if she struggled the accused would hurt her. After a while, the accused got dressed and left.</span></p>

She also testified that she had met the accused the month before when she served him as a customer at the convenience store where she worked. She saw him twice in the subsequent days and, on the second occasion, they went to the apartment. The accused saw pictures of the complainant and indicated that he would be interested in meeting her. When he then told the roommate that he wished to sleep with her, she refused and asked him to leave. When he refused to do so, she left the apartment and he followed a few minutes later. As they walked towards the bus stop, the accused pinned her to the wall and told her that he could never love her, he could only hurt her.</span></p>

He did not testify or call any witnesses. The basis of the accused's alternative argument was alleged inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony.</span></p>

The jury found the defendant guilty as charged but the Court of Appeal allowed the accused's appeal and ordered a new trial. The Court found that the trial judge had failed to instruct the jury on an essential element of the offenceââthat the accused knew that the comÂ­plainÂ­ant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she consented or notââand felt that it could not apply the curative provisions of s. 613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> in such a case. This appeal is to determine (1) whether the trial judge in a sexual assault case must always instruct the jurors that the Crown has to satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she consented or not; and (2) whether the admission of the roommate's evidence that the accused had made a sexual proposition to her violated the "similar fact" evidence exclusionary rule.</span></p>

In cases where there is nothing in the Crown's case to indicate that the accused honestly believed in the complainant's consent, the accused bears an evidentiary burden to introduce sufficient evidence if he wishes the issue to reach the jury. Where there is sufficient evidence, adduced by either the Crown or the defence, to put the issue before the jury, the Crown then bears the burden of persuading the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 244(4) of the <i>Code</i> is a legislative affirmation of the law previously enunciated as to the sufficiency of evidence required to raise the defence of mistaken belief in consent. It makes it clear that the trial judge should not in every case instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest, though mistaken, belief in consent. The trial judge should only give such an instruction when certain threshold requirements have been met: first, s. 244(4) requires the accused to allege an honest belief in consent; and second, the trial judge should only put the issue of honest belief to the jury if he is satisfied "that there is sufficient evidence and that if believed by the jury the evidence would constitute a defence". The section is not intended to impose the burden of proof of such defence on the accused but merely to affirm the preconditions that must be met before the trial judge is required to put the issue to the jury. Also, s. 244(4) still contemplates that an honest but unreasonable belief in consent will constitute a defence. Nevertheless, it directs the jury to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds as an important evidentiary factor in determining whether the accused had an honest belief in consent.</span></p>

There was not a sufficient factual basis in this case for the accused's allegation that he believed the complainant consented.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of the accused's discreditable conduct on past occasions that tended to show his bad disposition is inadmissible unless it is so probative of an issue in the case as to outweigh the prejudice caused. The similar fact evidence exclusionary rule can extend to acts other than criminal acts. In the present case, the admission of the roommate's evidence that the accused had made a sexual proposition to her did not violate the "similar fact" evidence exclusionary rule. The probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial value. The bulk of the roommate's testimony was highly relevant to the case. It provided, among other things, the background for the circumstances in which the assault occurred. It was also arguable that it had some relevance to the question of motive and intent. The evidence was thus of some probative value. While there was some element in the accused's conduct with the roommate which could be characterized as discreditable, the prejudice caused to the accused by the roommate's evidence was minimal because, when the roommate indicated that she was not interested in sleeping with him, the accused did not force himself upon her but desisted. In any event, even if the evidence should not have been admitted, the conviction should stand by virtue of the proviso of s. 613(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) of the <i>Code</i>. Given the persuasive nature of the evidence, the jury's verdict would necessarily have been the same even if the alleged error of law had not occurred.</span></p>

The complainant asked repeatedly what he had but he would not say. He said the complainant should let him in and he would give it to her. The complainant tried three or four times to telephone Eileen at work to find out if she had sent somebody over. The line was always busy. (Eileen was involved in a lengthy conversation with her boyfriend.) The complainant thought her roommate could be playing a joke on her although she had never done anything like that before. She unlocked and opened the door. The accused entered the livingâroom. The complainant had never seen him before. He appeared to have been drinking. She asked the accused who he was and what he had for her but got no response. She asked "Who are you, Bruce?" The accused replied "Bruce, the bad guy." The accused did not interfere when the complainant attempted, again unsuccessfully, to telephone her roommate. The accused used the telephone himself. While the complainant could not recall the substance of the accused's telephone conversation she had the impression he was talking to his brother. He said something about meeting his lawyer the next morning. At the end he said "Tell your wife I love her."</span></p>

Instead of making any move to leave he asked if he could sleep with her. At this point the complainant became afraid. She told the accused that if he did not leave she was going to scream whereupon the accused put one hand over her mouth and with the other hand took hold of her hair and pulled her away from the door. He put her on her back on the floor and lay down on top of her. The complainant tried to push the accused off. He told her the more she fought the harder it was going to be for Eileen to find her, that she would never look the same again. The complainant was terrified and lay still.</span></p>

He put his finger into her vagina. The complainant was crying. She felt helpless. In crossâexamination she testified that perhaps she should have struggled harder but she was frightened, shaking and confused.

The accused shoved his knee between her legs forcing them apart. He put his penis into her vagina. The complainant could not be sure whether the accused ejaculated during intercourse or not (subsequent forensic testing uncovered no semen or sperm in swabs taken from the victim). The accused stopped after a while and got dressed. As he was getting dressed, he turned to the complainant and said "You're just like her. You're just like all the rest." The complainant asked him what he meant by that. He said "You're my sixth." He brought the complainant with him to the kitchen. He had a glass of water and drank from a coke bottle.</span></p>

Doctor Gordon noted, upon a vaginal examination of the complainant, that her cervix was slightly red. This was consistent with forced sexual intercourse.

He identified as an inconsistency the complainant's testimony at the preliminary hearing that the accused had held her hair during the entire incident. At trial, on the other hand, she admitted that he had reduced his hold on her hair at various points. Defence counsel contended that there were three variations as to how the apartment door was closed, i.e., whether the accused sort of kicked it shut, whether he tapped it closed or whether it closed by itself. The complainant did not mention the accused's comments that she was like all the rest and that she was his sixth to the police or at the preliminary hearing. She recalled the comment some six months later. Defence counsel also pointed to the fact that the complainant did not scream, that there was a lack of injury to the genital area except for the redness of the cervix (which could be explained by a number of things) and the lack of apparent injuries to the complainant other than an abrasion above the left eyebrow and a sore tailbone. </span></p>

Therefore, the trial judge must in every case tell the jury that the Crown must satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not before they can convict. The accused need not introduce any evidence on this issue. Counsel for the defence submits in addition that s. 244(4) codifies the defence of mistake of fact. Under this defence sufficient evidence must be introduced before the trial judge can instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief that the complainant was consenting when determining his guilt or innocence. In other words, according to defence counsel, the issue of the accused's alleged honest but mistaken belief may come before the jury in two waysââas an element of the offence or as a defence. It is selfâevident that if the accused's counsel is correct, s. 244(4) is rendered redundant. If the issue of honest but mistaken belief is always going to reach the jury as an element of the offence, what does it matter if sometimes it will also reach the jury as a defence? The accused's counsel argues that his position is mandated by previous decisions of this Court.</span></p>

Speaking generally, at least where the circumstance is not "morally indifferent", the mental element must be proved with respect to all circumstances and consequences that form part of the <i>actus reus</i>. It follows that, in a case of alleged rape, where a fact or circumstance is not known to, or is misapprehended by, the accused, leading to a mistaken but honest belief in the consent of the woman, his act is not culpable in relation to that element of the offence:</span></p>

This crime was historically regarded as an offence of physical violence. Blackstone defined rape as "the carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will" (<i>Commentaries</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 210). A more comprehensive definition of rape at common law is found in Archbold, <i>Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice </i>(38th ed.) (1937), at para. 2871:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">Section 143 of our <i>Code</i>, in brief, defines rape as an act of sexual intercourse with a female person without her consent, or with consent if that consent is extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm. It will be seen that the statutory definition does not depart in any significant way from the common law definition. For all practical purposes, the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>merely codifies the common law. The essence of the crime consists in the commission of an act of sexual intercourse where a woman's consent, or genuine consent, has been withheld.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>actus reus </i>of rape is complete upon (a) an act of sexual intercourse; (b) without consent. An affirmative finding as to each of these elements does not finish the inquiry, however, for, as I have indicated, the requirement that there be a guilty intention must also be satisfied. The important question then arises as to whether at common law, and under s. 143 of the <i>Code</i>, the guilty intention for rape extends to the element of consent. In principle, it would seem that it should, as intention as to consent is central to responsibility; a man should only be punished where he proceeds with an act of violation in the knowledge that consent is withheld, or in a state of recklessness as to whether willingness is present. The intention to commit the act of intercourse, and to commit that act in the absence of consent, are two separate and distinct elements of the offence.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">I would conclude then that the <i>mens rea </i>for rape under s. 143(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Code </i>must involve knowledge that the woman is not consenting, or recklessness as to whether she is consenting or not, and for s. 143(<i>b</i>)(i), knowledge that the consent was given because of threats or fear of bodily harm, or recklessness as to its nature. It would follow, as has been held by the majority of this Court in <i>Pappajohn</i>, that an honest belief on the part of the accused, even though unreasonably held, that the woman was consenting to intercourse freely and voluntarily and not because of threats, would negate the <i>mens rea </i>under s. 143(<i>b</i>)(i) of the <i>Code </i>and entitle the accused to an acquittal. </span></p>

In addition, I believe that previous case law establishes the proposition that, where there is sufficient evidence for the issue to go to the jury, the Crown bears the burden of persuading the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not. Using the language of Glanville Williams in <i>Criminal Law: The General Part </i>(2nd ed. 1961), at pp. 871â910, there are two separate burdens in relation to the issue of honest but mistaken beliefââthe evidentiary burden and the burden of persuasion. Evidence must be introduced that satisfies the judge that the issue should be put to the jury. This evidence may be introduced by the Crown or by the defence. The accused bears the evidentiary burden only in the limited sense that, if there is nothing in the Crown's case to indicate that the accused honestly believed in the complainant's consent, then the accused will have to introduce evidence if he wishes the issue to reach the jury. Once the issue is put to the jury the Crown bears the risk of not being able to persuade the jury of the accused's guilt.</span></p>

Before any obligation arises to put defences, there must be in the evidence some basis upon which the defence can rest and it is only where such an evidentiary basis is present that a trial judge must put a defence. Indeed, where it is not present he should not put a defence for to do so would only be to confuse.</span></p>

Ordinarily, when there is any evidence of a matter of fact, the proof of which may be relevant to the guilt or innocence of an accused, the trial judge must leave that evidence to the jury so that they may reach their own conclusion upon it. Where, however, the trial judge is asked to put a specific defence to the jury, he is not concerned only with the existence or nonâexistence of evidence of fact. He must consider, assuming that the evidence relied upon by the accused to support a defence is true, whether that evidence is sufficient to justify the putting of the defence. This question has been considered frequently in the courts: See <i>Wu v. The King</i>, [1934] S.C.R. 609, and <i>Kelsey v. The Queen</i>, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220.

In this case, to convey such a sense of reality, there must be some evidence which, if believed, would support the existence of a mistaken but honest belief that the complainant was in fact consenting to the acts of intercourse which admittedly occurred.

In <i>Sansâ regret</i> the accused was tried before a judge without a jury. The line between the evidentiary burden and the burden of persuasion tends to be blurred in such a case. The trial judge found that the complainant consented out of fear and that the accused blinded himself to the obvious and made no inquiry as to the nature of the consent which was given. The <i>mens rea </i>for rape involves a knowledge that the woman is consenting because of threats or fear of bodily harm, or recklessness as to its nature. Therefore, McIntyre J. said at p. 587:</span></p>

Where the accused is deliberately ignorant as a result of blinding himself to reality the law presumes knowledge, in this case knowledge of the nature of the consent. There was therefore no room for the operation of this defence.</span></p>

The defence of mistake, as Dickson J. pointed out in <i>Pappajohn</i>, is simply a denial of <i>mens rea </i>which does not involve the accused in a burden of proof. He does, however, have to adduce sufficient evidence to put the defence in issue. Glanville Williams, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 909â10, expresses his view that the defence of mistake of fact means that the accused has an evidentiary burden but not a persuasive burden.</span></p>

In <i>Woolmington v. D.P.P.</i>, [1935] A.C. 462, the House of Lords stated that when a defence to a charge of murder is accident or provocation, the burden of satisfying the jury still rests on the prosecution.

If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner,...the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.</span></p>

The House of Lords pointed out that the judge need not deal in his charge with the issues of accident or provocation merely because the defences are raised. There must be some evidence of accident or provocation that may be true. Then, and only then, must the judge deal with the issue in his summingâup and then, and only then, must the jury find in favour of the accused unless the Crown satisfies them beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence is untrue.</span></p>

In my view, the inclusion of s. 244(4) in the <i>Code </i>makes it clear that the trial judge should not in every case instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest, though mistaken, belief in consent. The trial judge should only give such an instruction when certain threshold requirements have been met. These requirements are totally consistent with the previous case law. First, s. 244(4) requires the accused to allege an honest belief in consent. Second, the trial judge should only put the issue of honest belief to the jury if he is satisfied "that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence". This is consistent with this Court's view that the trial judge should instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest belief as to consent only where there was evidence to support such a plea. When s. 244(4) states that the trial judge should consider whether the evidence would constitute a defence, the defence referred to is, in my view, the defence of mistake of fact. The section is not intended to impose the burden of proof of such defence on the accused but merely to affirm the preâconditions that must be met before the trial judge is required to put the issue to the jury.</span></p>

There must be evidence which gives an air of reality to the defence of mistake of fact before the court will consider it: see <i>R. v. Cook </i>(1985), 46 C.R. (3d) 128 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v.

The jury will be concerned to consider the reasonableness of any grounds found, or asserted to be available, to support the defence of mistake. Although "reasonable grounds" is not a precondition to the availability of a plea of honest belief in consent, those grounds determine the weight to be given the defence. The reasonableness, or otherwise, of the accused's belief is only evidence for, or against, the view that the belief was actually held and the intent was, therefore, lacking.</span></p>

Nevertheless, it directs the jury to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds as an important evidentiary factor in determining whether the accused had an honest belief in consent. This was the view of s. 244(4) taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. White</i>, <i>supra</i>, and the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Moreau</i>, <i>supra</i>. It is also the view taken by the academic commentators: see D. Watt, <i>The New Offences Against the Person: The Provisions of Bill Câ127 </i>(1984), at p. 83; G.

There is not, in my view, a sufficient factual basis in this case for the accused's allegation that he believed the comÂ­plainÂ­ant consented. There is no air of reality to it. The accused did not testify. He called no witnesses. The accused and the complainant did not know each other. The complainant suffered physical injury.

A general statement of the exclusionary rule is that evidence of the accused's discreditable conduct on past occasions tended to show his bad disposition is inadmissible unless it is so probative of an issue or issues in the case as to outweigh the prejudice caused: see <i>Cross on Evidence </i>(6th ed. 1985) at p. 311. A very useful overview of the similar fact evidence rule is contained in <i>Sweitzer v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949, at pp. 952â54:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of the admissibility of similar fact evidence has been the subject of much legal writing to be found in the decided cases and textbooks and in the academic articles and commentaries. The general principle stated by Lord Herschell in <i>Makin v. The AttorneyâGeneral for New South Wales</i>, [1894] A.C. 57, at p. 65, has been largely accepted as the basis for the admission of this evidence. He said:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their Lordships' opinion the principles which must govern the decision of the case are clear, though the application of them is by no means free from difficulty. It is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried. On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to an issue before the jury, and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the indictment were designed or accidental, or to rebut a defence which would otherwise be open to the accused. The statement of these general principles is easy, but it is obvious that it may often be very difficult to draw the line and to decide whether a particular piece of evidence is on the one side or the other.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years in seeking to apply this principle judges have tended to create a list of categories or types of cases in which similar fact evidence could be admitted, generally by reference to the purpose for which the evidence was adduced. Evidence of similar facts has been adduced to prove intent, to prove a system, to prove a plan, to show malice, to rebut the defence of accident or mistake, to prove identity, to rebut the defence of innocent association, and for other similar and related purposes. This list is not complete.</span></p>

In answering this question, we need to decide whether the accused's conduct was discreditable. The accused's conduct towards Eileen was not criminal. In the passage from <i>Makin v. AttorneyâGeneral for New South Wales</i>, [1894] A.C. 57, Lord Herschell refers only to "criminal acts" and "criminal conduct or character". It appears, however, that discreditable conduct extends beyond criminal acts. This was the view taken by the English Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Barrington</i>, [1981] 1 All E.R. 1132. In that case, the prosecution sought to bolster the evidence of three young complainants of indecency by the accused with evidence from three other girls. The evidence of these girls indicated that the accused had gone through much the same process of recruiting the girls supposedly for babysitting and showing them pornographic magazines and photographs. It was not, however, alleged that any acts of criminal conduct or indecency took place. The court treated this as similar fact evidence. It decided that the evidence could be properly admitted because its features were strikingly similar to the circumstances surrounding the offence charged and because there was no suggestion that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. Given that the similar fact evidence rule can extend to acts other than criminal acts, it falls to consider whether the probative value outweighs the prejudicial value of the evidence; see <i>Sweitzer</i>, <i>supra</i>.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">43.</span><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In discussing the probative value we must consider the degree of relevance to the facts in issue and the strength of the inference that can be drawn. The bulk of Eileen's testimony is, of course, highly relevant to the case. It provides the background for the circumstances in which the assault occurred. It makes it clear how the respondent came to arrive at the complainant's doorstep on the morning in question, how he knew to use Eileen's name, why he might be interested in the victim, and why he could have anticipated that the complainant would be home alone at the relevant time.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">44.</span><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence of the proposition made to Eileen makes the narrative clearer as it indicates the note on which the first visit to the apartment ended. It makes consistent and credible Eileen's assertion that she did not send the accused over to see the complainant on the morning in question. Further, it is arguable that it has some relevance to the question of motive and intent. The Crown suggests that the accused, rebuffed by the roommate Eileen, had a motive for turning his attention to the complainant, a woman in whom he had earlier indicated an interest. The degree of probative value required varies with the prejudicial effect of the admission of the evidence. The probative value of evidence may increase if there is a degree of similarity in circumstances and proximity in time and place. However, admissibility does not turn on such a striking similarity: see L. H. Hoffmann, "Similar Facts After <i>Boardman</i>" (1975), 91 <i>L.Q.R. </i>193, at p. 201. In my view, the evidence here is of some, though not of great, probative value.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-36.0pt;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">45.</span><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the evidence prejudicial? In this case, the conduct towards the roommate Eileen is certainly not as discreditable as, for example, the conduct involved in <i>Barrington</i>, <i>supra</i>. In fact, it might be argued that the accused's conduct was not discreditable and hence not prejudicial at all. He propositioned a woman. When she indicated that she was not interested, he desisted. He did not force himself upon her. However, there are elements of the incident which could be characterized as discreditable. After Eileen indicated that she would not sleep with the accused he put his arms around her. She asked him to leave repeatedly and he repeatedly refused. She finally felt she had to leave and go to the outside porch. When they were walking to the bus stop, he pinned her against the wall. He said he could never love her, he could only hurt her. Although this is capable of an innocent interpretation, it is also capable of a sinister interpretation. The evidence causes prejudice but it causes very little prejudice because the accused desisted. I would conclude, therefore, on balance that the evidence was properly admitted.</span></p>

Given the persuasive nature of the evidence in this case the jury's verdict would necessarily have been the same (see <i>Colpitts v. The Queen,</i> [1965] S.C.R. 739) even if the alleged error of law had not occurred.</span></p>
