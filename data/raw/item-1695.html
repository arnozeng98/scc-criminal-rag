24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The accused, an aboriginal woman, pled guilty to manslaughter for the killing of her common law husband and was sentenced to three years‚Äô imprisonment.&nbsp; On the night of the incident, the accused was celebrating her 19th birthday and drank beer with some friends and family members, including the victim.&nbsp; She suspected the victim was having an affair with her older sister and, when her sister left the party, followed by the victim, the accused told her friend, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to get it.&nbsp; He‚Äôs really going to get it this time‚Äù.&nbsp; She later found the victim and her sister coming down the stairs together in her sister‚Äôs home.&nbsp; She believed that they had been engaged in sexual activity.&nbsp; When the accused and the victim returned to their townhouse, they started to quarrel.&nbsp; During the argument, the accused confronted the victim with his infidelity and he told her that she was fat and ugly and not as good as the others.&nbsp; A few minutes later, the victim fled their home.&nbsp; The accused ran toward him with a large knife and stabbed him in the chest. When returning to her home, she was heard saying ‚ÄúI got you, you fucking bastard‚Äù.&nbsp; There was also evidence indicating that she had stabbed the victim on the arm before he left the townhouse.&nbsp; At the time of the stabbing, the accused had a blood‚Äëalcohol content of between 155 and 165 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">At the sentencing hearing, the judge took into account several mitigating factors.&nbsp; The accused was a young mother and, apart from an impaired driving conviction, she had no criminal record.&nbsp; Her family was supportive and, while on bail,&nbsp; she had attended alcohol abuse counselling and upgraded her education.&nbsp; The accused was provoked by the victim‚Äôs insulting behaviour and remarks.&nbsp; At the time of the offence, the accused had a hyperthyroid condition which caused her to overreact to emotional situations.&nbsp; She showed some signs of remorse and entered a plea of guilty.&nbsp; The sentencing judge also identified several aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; The accused stabbed the deceased twice, the second time after he had fled in an attempt to escape.&nbsp; From the remarks she made before and after the stabbing it was clear that the accused intended to harm the victim.&nbsp; Further, she was not afraid of the victim; she was the aggressor. The judge considered that the principles of denunciation and general deterrence must play a role in the present circumstances even though specific deterrence was not required.&nbsp; He also indicated that the sentence should take into account the need to rehabilitate the accused.&nbsp; The judge decided that a suspended sentence or a conditional sentence of imprisonment was not appropriate in this case. He noted that there were no special circumstances arising from the aboriginal status of the accused and the victim that he should take into consideration.&nbsp; Both were living in an urban area off‚Äëreserve and not ‚Äúwithin the aboriginal community as such‚Äù.&nbsp; The sentencing judge concluded that the offence was a very serious one, for which the appropriate sentence was three years‚Äô imprisonment.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused‚Äôs appeal of her sentence.</span></p>

The provision is not simply a codification of existing jurisprudence.&nbsp; It is remedial in nature and is designed to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people in prisons, and to encourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to sentencing. There is a judicial duty to give the provision‚Äôs remedial purpose real force.&nbsp; Section&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) must be read in the context of the rest of the factors referred to in that section and in light of all of Part&nbsp;XXIII.&nbsp; In determining a fit sentence, all principles and factors set out in that Part must be taken into consideration.&nbsp; Attention should be paid to the fact that Part XXIII, through certain provisions,&nbsp; has placed a new emphasis upon decreasing the use of incarceration.</span></p>

The absence of alternative sentencing programs specific to an aboriginal community does not eliminate the ability of a sentencing judge to impose a sanction that takes into account principles of restorative justice and the needs of the parties involved.&nbsp; </span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">If there is no alternative to incarceration the length of the term must be carefully considered.&nbsp; The jail term for an aboriginal offender may in some circumstances be less than the term imposed on a non‚Äëaboriginal offender for the same offence. However,&nbsp; s.&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) is not to be taken as a means of automatically reducing the prison sentence of aboriginal offenders; nor should it be assumed that an offender is receiving a more lenient sentence simply because incarceration is not imposed.&nbsp; It is also unreasonable to assume that aboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional sentencing goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where warranted.&nbsp; In this context, generally, the more serious and violent the crime, the more likely it will be as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment will be the same for similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is aboriginal or non‚Äëaboriginal.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Section 718.2(<i>e</i>) applies to all aboriginal persons wherever they reside, whether on‚Äë or off‚Äëreserve, in a large city or a rural area.&nbsp; In defining the relevant aboriginal community for the purpose of achieving an effective sentence, the term ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù must be defined broadly so as to include any network of support and interaction that might be available, including one in an urban centre.&nbsp; At the same time, the residence of the aboriginal offender in an urban centre that lacks any network of support does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to try to find an alternative to imprisonment.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In this case, the sentencing judge&nbsp; may have erred in limiting the application of s.&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders living in rural areas or on‚Äëreserve. Moreover, he does not appear to have considered the systemic or background factors which may have influenced the accused to engage in criminal conduct, or the possibly distinct conception of sentencing held by the accused, by the victim‚Äôs family, and by their community.&nbsp; The majority of the Court of Appeal, in dismissing the accused‚Äôs appeal, also does not appear to have considered many of the relevant factors.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; in most cases such errors would be sufficient to justify sending the matter back for a new sentencing hearing, in these circumstances it would not be in the interests of justice to order a new hearing in order to canvass the accused‚Äôs circumstances as an aboriginal offender.&nbsp; Both the sentencing judge and all members of the Court of Appeal acknowledged that the offence was a particularly serious one.&nbsp; For that offence by this offender a sentence of three years‚Äô imprisonment was not unreasonable. More importantly, the accused was granted,&nbsp; subject to certain conditions,&nbsp; day parole after she had served six&nbsp;months in a correctional centre and, about a year ago, was granted full parole with the same conditions.&nbsp; The results of the sentence with incarceration for six months and the subsequent controlled release were in the interests of both the accused and society. </span></p>

Codification, under this view, is remedial in and of itself because it simplifies and adds structure to trial level sentencing decisions: see, e.g., <i>McDonald</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp.&nbsp;460‚Äë64, <i>per</i> Sherstobitoff J.A.</p>

Fireman</i> (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 82, in support of the view that s.&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) should be seen simply as a codification of the state of the case law regarding the sentencing of aboriginal offenders before Part&nbsp;XXIII came into force in 1996.&nbsp; In a similar vein, it was observed by Sherstobitoff J.A. in<i> McDonald</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp.&nbsp;463‚Äë64, that it has always been a principle of sentencing that courts should consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances.&nbsp; Thus the general principle of restraint expressed in s.&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) with respect to all offenders might equally be seen as a codification of existing law.</p>

(<i>d</i>) focus upon the restorative goals of repairing the harms suffered by individual victims and by the community as a whole, promoting a sense of responsibility and an acknowledgment of the harm caused on the part of the offender, and attempting to rehabilitate or heal the offender.&nbsp; The concept of restorative justice which underpins paras. (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), and (<i>f</i>) is briefly discussed below, but as a general matter restorative justice involves some form of restitution and reintegration into the community. &nbsp;The need for offenders to take responsibility for their actions is central to the sentencing process: D. Kwochka, ‚ÄúAboriginal Injustice: Making Room for a Restorative Paradigm‚Äù (1996), 60<i> Sask. L. Rev.</i> 153, at p. 165.&nbsp; Restorative sentencing goals do not usually correlate with the use of prison as a sanction.&nbsp; In our view, Parliament‚Äôs choice to include (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) alongside the traditional sentencing goals must be understood as evidencing an intention to expand the parameters of the sentencing analysis for all offenders.&nbsp; The principle of restraint expressed in s.&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) will necessarily be informed by this re‚Äëorientation.</p>

M. (C.A.)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p.&nbsp;567, Lamer C.J. restated the long-standing principle of Canadian sentencing law that the appropriateness of a sentence will depend on the particular circumstances of the offence, the offender, and the community in which the offence took place.&nbsp; Disparity of sentences for similar crimes is a natural consequence of this individualized focus.&nbsp; As he stated:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sentencing is an inherently individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of academic abstraction.&nbsp; As well, sentences for a particular offence should be expected to vary to some degree across various communities and regions of this country, as the ‚Äújust and appropriate‚Äù mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurred.</p>

-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 718.2(<i>e</i>) mandatorily requires sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment and to pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 718.2(<i>e</i>) is not simply a codification of existing jurisprudence. It is remedial in nature.&nbsp; Its purpose is to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people in prisons, and to encourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to sentencing.&nbsp; There is a judicial duty to give the provision‚Äôs remedial purpose real force.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) must be read and considered in the context of the rest of the factors referred to in that section and in light of all of Part&nbsp;XXIII.&nbsp; All principles and factors set out in Part&nbsp;XXIII must be taken into consideration in determining the fit sentence.&nbsp; Attention should be paid to the fact that Part XXIII, through ss. 718, 718.2(<i>e</i>), and 742.1, among other provisions, has placed a new emphasis upon decreasing the use of incarceration.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sentencing is an individual process and in each case the consideration must continue to be what is a fit sentence for this accused for this offence in this community.&nbsp; However, the effect of s.&nbsp;718.2(<i>e</i>) is to alter the method of analysis which sentencing judges must use in determining a fit sentence for aboriginal offenders.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 718.2(<i>e</i>) directs sentencing judges to undertake the sentencing of aboriginal offenders individually, but also differently, because the circumstances of aboriginal people are unique.&nbsp; In sentencing an aboriginal offender, the judge must consider:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
</div> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:117.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-38.55pt;line-height:24.4pt">(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts; and</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:117.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-38.55pt;line-height:24.4pt">(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to undertake these considerations the trial judge will require information pertaining to the accused.&nbsp; Judges may take judicial notice of the broad systemic and background factors affecting aboriginal people, and of the priority given in aboriginal cultures to a restorative approach to sentencing.&nbsp; In the usual course of events, additional case‚Äëspecific information will come from counsel and from a pre‚Äësentence report which takes into account the factors set out in #6, which in turn may come from representations of the relevant aboriginal community which will usually be that of the offender.&nbsp; The offender may waive the gathering of that information.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no alternative to incarceration the length of the term must be carefully considered.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 718.2(<i>e</i>) is not to be taken as a means of automatically reducing the prison sentence of aboriginal offenders; nor should it be assumed that an offender is receiving a more lenient sentence simply because incarceration is not imposed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

-31.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp; 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The absence of alternative sentencing programs specific to an aboriginal community does not eliminate the ability of a sentencing judge to impose a sanction that takes into account principles of restorative justice and the needs of the parties involved.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:76.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-31.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 718.2(<i>e</i>) applies to all aboriginal persons wherever they reside, whether on- or off-reserve, in a large city or a rural area.&nbsp; In defining the relevant aboriginal community for the purpose of achieving an effective sentence, the term ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù must be defined broadly so as to include any network of support and interaction that might be available, including in an urban centre.&nbsp; At the same time, the residence of the aboriginal offender in an urban centre that lacks any network of support does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to try to find an alternative to imprisonment.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:76.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-31.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp; 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the foregoing, the jail term for an aboriginal offender may in some circumstances be less than the term imposed on a non‚Äëaboriginal offender for the same offence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:76.5pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-31.5pt;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp; 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional sentencing goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where warranted.&nbsp; In this context, generally, the more serious and violent the crime, the more likely it will be as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment will be the same for similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is aboriginal or non‚Äëaboriginal.</p>
