24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Iacobucci, Major, Binnie and Arbour JJ.:&nbsp; Appellate review of a charge to the jury is not a mechanical task, but rather an assessment of whether the deficiencies in the charge, as compared to the <i>Lifchus</i> standard, cause serious concern about the jury’s verdict.&nbsp; The key question is whether the charge, in the context of the entire trial, substantially complies with the principles expressed in <i>Lifchus</i> so that as a whole it does not give rise to the reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the correct standard of proof. When reviewing a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> charge, there is no particular mistake or omission that will automatically constitute a reversible error in and of itself, nor is there an additional instruction that will immediately cure a particular shortcoming.&nbsp; Where the majority of a charge complies with <i>Lifchus</i> principles, but the trial judge has omitted to expressly indicate that more than probable guilt is required, or has made that omission in conjunction with another error, such as defining reasonable doubt as having a plain and ordinary meaning, these shortcomings can be countered by other parts of the jury instructions that serve to make the proper definition of reasonable doubt more clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the charge as a whole was in substantial compliance with <i>Lifchus</i> principles. Although, viewed in light of <i>Lifchus</i>, certain aspects of the charge were deficient, other parts of the jury instruction dealing with credibility and circumstantial evidence served to clarify the proper definition of reasonable doubt&nbsp; so that there can be no reasonable concern that the jury may have proceeded to convict by applying the wrong standard of proof. </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> LeBel J. (dissenting):<b> </b>&nbsp;The primary concept arising out of <i>Lifchus</i> is that the trial judge must explain to the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is distinct from, and a higher standard than, proof on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; Although no particular words need to be used, this essential concept must be conveyed as part of the required explanation of reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The jury must be made aware that a probability standard is not sufficient to determine criminal guilt. In this case, the charge was not in substantial compliance with the principles in <i>Lifchus</i> and was therefore inadequate.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the jury was instructed that the term “reasonable doubt” was to be given its natural meaning, and was not a legal term having some special connotation.&nbsp; This explanation invited the jurors to rely on their own personal views or experience about what reasonable doubt may mean, and was likely<b> </b>an invitation to apply a probability standard similar to that which they would apply in making their everyday decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, although the instruction warned the jury away from a standard of proof that is too high, the trial judge made no mention of the inappropriately low standard of probability.&nbsp; As a result, there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood this key aspect of its deliberative task.</span></p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">While the part of the charge dealing with the contradictory evidence seems adequate, this was not sufficient to cure the inadequacy of the general explanation of reasonable doubt.&nbsp; No matter how flawless the instruction may have been with regard to the contradictory evidence, once the jury decided which version of events it was inclined to believe, it still could not have made a fair assessment of guilt if it did not know the proper standard of proof to apply to the evidence in support of that version.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Finally, the trial was essentially a battle of credibility between the accused and the complainants.&nbsp; The assessment of credibility is an everyday exercise likely to be carried out according to a standard based on probability.&nbsp; The relatively simple nature of the trial may therefore have reinforced the jury’s impression that no special legal concepts were at play, and that its ordinary approach to probability-based problem solving was appropriate.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The term “reasonable doubt” is to be given its natural meaning.&nbsp; It is not a legal term having some special connotation.&nbsp; A reasonable doubt is an honest and fair doubt based upon reason and common sense, it is a real doubt, not an imaginary or frivolous doubt, it is a doubt based on reason, therefore, if you were to ask yourself why you doubt you could assign a logical reason for your doubt.&nbsp; A logical reason in this context means a reason connected to the evidence itself, including any conflict you may find exists after considering the evidence as a whole or through an absence of evidence which in the circumstances in this case you believe is essential to a conviction.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">You must not base your doubt on the proposition that nothing is certain, therefore, you have doubt or on the proposition that anything is possible, therefore, you have a doubt.&nbsp; You are not entitled to set up a standard of absolute certainty and say that the evidence does not measure up to that standard.&nbsp; In many things in life it is not possible to prove absolute certainty.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">If after careful consideration of all of the evidence, the addresses of counsel and my instructions on the law, there remains a reasonable doubt in your mind as to the guilt of the accused, the Crown has failed to meet the standard of proof which the law requires, the presumption of innocence would therefore prevail and you must acquit.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the presumption of innocence has been displaced, you must convict.&nbsp; When in the course of this charge I tell you what the Crown must prove I will always mean proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Esson J.A. acknowledged that failure to characterize reasonable doubt as a legal term having a special meaning was held by this Court in <i>Lifchus</i> to be an error in law.&nbsp; At para. 6, the majority of the Court of Appeal quoted Cory J. in <i>Lifchus</i> at para. 22, as follows:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

(K.)</i>, one of the two cases heard by the British Columbia Court of Appeal simultaneously with this one.&nbsp; In <i>K. (K.)</i>, Esson J.A. concluded that the alleged errors did not contravene authority that existed before <i>Lifchus</i>, and, since <i>Lifchus</i> was meant to apply prospectively, there was no reason to disregard the principles that existed at the time the charge was delivered (i.e., <i>R. v. Brydon</i> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 509 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R. v. Lord</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 747, aff’g (1993), 36 B.C.A.C. 223).&nbsp; In reference to the omission of various “reasonable doubt” instructions recommended in <i>Lifchus</i>, Esson J.A. noted in <i>K. (K.)</i>, at para. 35:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">At the time the charge was given there was no authority which required the trial judge to include the words “absence of evidence”, or to instruct the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is something more than proof on the balance of probabilities, or to instruct the jury that it must be “sure”.&nbsp; Those matters are included in the suggested charge in <i>Lifchus</i> to which trial judges no doubt are now paying respectful attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The majority concluded that, since reasonable doubt was never defined, and since nearly all of the instructions given served to actually weaken the content of the reasonable doubt standard, there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the wrong standard, which in turn raised a realistic possibility that the accused’s convictions constituted a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; These errors were made in the context of a trial in which the majority of this Court held that incriminating inadmissible evidence had been introduced at trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>

24.4pt">In <i>Starr</i>, the major issue before the Court was that, in the view of the majority, the trial judge had improperly allowed inadmissible evidence.&nbsp; In <i>Avetysan</i>, the trial judge failed to warn the jury that even if it disbelieved the accused, it could still entertain a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;I am not persuaded that there is any reason to interfere with the majority’s [Alberta Court of Appeal] disposition of the appeal, particularly when it thoroughly addressed the elements of the <i>Lifchus</i> principles.&nbsp; The fact that the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed all other grounds of appeal, and none of these other issues is before us, distinguishes this case from <i>Starr</i> and <i>Avetysan</i>.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Thus, while the instructions in <i>Starr</i> and <i>Avetysan</i> were clearly not in full compliance with the principles articulated in <i>Lifchus</i>, there were other&nbsp; issues in each case that served to aggravate, rather than alleviate, the concern that the jury may have misunderstood its task and reached a wrong verdict.</p>

(D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, and specifically informed the jury on how the issue of credibility applies to reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The trial judge charged as follows:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">Where an error is made in the instruction on the burden of proof, the fact that the trial judge correctly instructed on that issue elsewhere in the charge is a strong indication that the jury were not left in doubt as to the burden resting on the Crown.</p>

<div class="Section21">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Where the majority of a charge complies with <i>Lifchus</i> principles and the trial judge has omitted to expressly indicate that more than “probable guilt” is required, it would not be reasonable to conclude that a juror, after having received additional instructions akin to those recommended in <i>W. (D.)</i>, would remain under the impression that anything less than a proper criminal burden of proof could rest on the Crown.&nbsp; Even where such an omission is made in conjunction with another error, such as defining reasonable doubt as having a plain and ordinary meaning, such shortcomings can be countered by other parts of the jury instructions that serve to make the proper definition of reasonable doubt more clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>

(D.)</i> charge, it would seem that any concern that the jury may have applied a probable guilt standard disappears upon consideration of these instructions with regard to circumstantial evidence.</p>

Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 2000 SCC 40, at para. 241:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">... there is no universally intelligible illustration of the concept, such as the scales of justice with respect to the balance of probabilities standard.&nbsp; Unlike absolute certainty or the balance of probabilities, reasonable doubt is not an easily quantifiable standard.&nbsp; It cannot be measured or described by analogy.&nbsp; It must be explained.&nbsp; However, precisely because it is not quantifiable, it is difficult to explain.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The key difficulty with this instruction is that it was not made clear to the jury that the Crown was required to do more than prove the appellant’s guilt on a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; The trial judge told the jury that they could convict on the basis of something less than absolute certainty of guilt, but did not explain, in essence, how much less.&nbsp; In addition, rather than telling the jury that the words “reasonable doubt” have a specific meaning in the legal context, the trial judge expressly instructed the jury that the words have no “special connotation” and “no magic meaning that is peculiar to the law”.&nbsp; By asserting that absolute certainty was not required, and then linking the standard of proof to the “ordinary everyday” meaning of the words “reasonable doubt”, the trial judge could easily have been understood by the jury as asserting a probability standard as the applicable standard of proof.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The result in <i>Beauchamp</i> was consistent with this approach, where only a so-called “secondary” factor was at issue.&nbsp; The judge’s only flaw in that jury charge was to describe “beyond a reasonable doubt” as a “moral certainty”.&nbsp; Otherwise, the charge did adequately explain that reasonable doubt exists between the upper and lower limits of absolute certainty and probability.&nbsp; The reference to morality was only one way in which the trial judge defined the space between these limits <sup>__</sup> a factor, although not ideal, that was nevertheless not fatal to the fairness of the trial.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">In <i>Starr</i>, as in <i>Avetysan</i>, the cumulative effect of errors that were made on issues that went to the jury led us to the conclusion that a new trial was warranted.&nbsp; In <i>Starr</i>, the major issue before the Court was that, in the view of the majority, the trial judge had improperly allowed inadmissible evidence.&nbsp; In <i>Avetysan</i>, the trial judge failed to warn the jury that even if it disbelieved the accused, it could still entertain a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Here, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am not persuaded that there is any reason to interfere with the majority’s disposition of the appeal, particularly when it thoroughly addressed the elements of the <i>Lifchus</i> principles.&nbsp; The fact that the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed all other grounds of appeal, and none of these other issues is before us, distinguishes this case from <i>Starr</i> and <i>Avetysan</i>.&nbsp; Consequently, I cannot say that the accused’s trial was unfair in the sense that the integrity of the verdict was compromised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The principal message to be taken from <i>Russell</i> and the other cases which have applied <i>Lifchus</i> is that, where a jury charge does not substantially comply with <i>Lifchus</i>, it will be inadequate – nothing more is needed.&nbsp; <i>Russell</i> met the <i>Lifchus</i> standard.&nbsp; But, that is not the case in the present appeal.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">But, as the jurisprudence indicates, these “secondary” factors are only helpful in explaining reasonable doubt, but not sufficient, without some assurance that the jury will apply a standard higher than probability.&nbsp; In <i>Russell</i>, that was accomplished.&nbsp; In this case, the ceiling was set, but the floor was missing.</p>

K. (K.) </i>(2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 35, 2000 BCCA 161, to rule that a jury charge on reasonable doubt delivered before <i>Lifchus</i> need not comply with <i>Lifchus</i>’s enumerated principles (at paras. 3-5):&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">As in <i>K.K.</i>, the trial took place before the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Lifchus </i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .</p>

<div class="Section36">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The appellant alleges five errors, two of omission and three of commission is defining reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The alleged errors of omission are in failing to instruct the jury that more is required than probable guilt and in failing to instruct them that they must be “sure” that the accused committed the offence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">For the reasons given in <i>K.K.</i>, I find no merit in those submissions.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:24.4pt">69<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons in <i>K. (K.)</i>, at para.&nbsp;19, make it clear that Esson J.A. was of the view that <i>Lifchus</i> has no retroactive effect:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The lengthy discussion under the heading “How Should the Expression ‘Reasonable Doubt’ be Explained to the Jury?” [in <i>Lifchus</i>] is undoubtedly of major importance.&nbsp; But it does not arise out of the facts of the case and, in my view, is clearly intended to apply only to future cases, and not to charges given before September 18, 1997 [the release date of <i>Lifchus</i>].&nbsp; It is implicit in the term “suggested charge” that Cory J., in that section of his reasons, was speaking to the future.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Again, in para. 24 of <i>K. (K.)</i>, Esson J.A. writes:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The basic error in <i>Lowns</i> [<i>R. v. Lowns</i> (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 295 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1999] 1 S.C.R. xii], in my respectful view, is in assuming that the suggested charge in <i>Lifchus</i> is to be applied to cases which, at the date of that decision, were “in the system”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Finally, in para. 26 of <i>K. (K.)</i>, the point is again reiterated:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">It may well be that the holding in <i>Lifchus</i> that it is a fundamental principle that juries be provided with a definition of reasonable doubt will be found to apply to cases which were “in the pipeline” at the date of that decision.&nbsp; But that cannot rationally apply to the model charge which brings about merely an incremental change in established law and which, on its face, is intended to apply only prospectively.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:24.4pt">70<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on this view, in the present case Esson J.A. concluded, at para.&nbsp;7:</p>
</div> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>
<div class="Section37">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">When the comment that reasonable doubt is not a legal term is read in its context, it must be seen as being at worst a harmless error if, before <i>Lifchus</i>, it could be considered an error at all.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Esson J.A. was at a disadvantage, as he was deciding before the release of this Court’s judgments in <i>Starr</i>, <i>Bisson</i> and <i>Avetysan</i>.&nbsp; These cases make it clear that all of the principles enumerated in <i>Lifchus</i> will and must be applied to jury charges delivered before its release, but still in the system.&nbsp; As I remarked at the outset of these reasons, this Court has noted how this has given rise to a vexing “transitional period”, but one in which, nevertheless, courts “will continue to be vigilant to ensure that unfair trials and miscarriages of justice do not go unremedied”.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">V.&nbsp; <u>Conclusion</u></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm;
