T.S. 1976 No. 3).&nbsp; The extradition judge in each case ordered respondent committed for extradition.&nbsp; Applications were brought for <i>habeas corpus</i>, where respondent argued that the charges were not extraditable under American law.&nbsp; The application succeeded in the first case, and was upheld on appeal.&nbsp; In the second case, the chambers judge concluded that the offence was extraditable under American law, but the Court of Appeal overturned his decision.&nbsp; The respondent voluntarily left the country but, because of the importance of the issue raised and because respondent could arguably return to Canada, the appellant still sought the Court's decision on these cases.</span></p>

However, as these passages make clear, the concept of an "extradition crime" or a crime that falls within the appropriate treaty is central to his or her task.&nbsp; These passages also affirm that in the context of the Canada‑United States Treaty, "extradition crime" includes the requirement that the crime be an offence in the United States and listed in the Treaty according to United States law.&nbsp; If that requirement is not met, then the extradition judge has no jurisdiction to issue a warrant for committal under s.&nbsp;18 of the Act.&nbsp; That the extradition judge must determine that the double criminality and listing requirements are met is confirmed by s.&nbsp;15 of the Act which requires the judge to receive evidence tendered to show that the crime of which the fugitive is accused is, <u>for any reason</u>, not an extradition crime.</span></p>

Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1991] 2 All E.R. 366 (H.L.), that case reiterates that one of the functions of the extradition judge is to determine that he or she is dealing with an "extradition crime" (at p.&nbsp;378).&nbsp; Where an "extradition crime" includes a requirement relating to the law of the requesting state, I do not see how it can be beyond the jurisdiction of the extradition judge to consider such law.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

C. Blanchflower, "Examination of the Law of the Requesting State in Extradition Proceedings" (1992), 34 <i>Crim L.Q.</i> 277, and "Interpretation and Application of Extradition Crime in the Extradition Act" (1992), 34 <i>Crim. L.Q.</i> 158, at pp.&nbsp;173‑74.&nbsp; There is no evidence to support the conclusion that this practice has slowed extradition proceedings to a halt.&nbsp; Furthermore, the practice appears to be the same in the United States when Canada is the requesting state.&nbsp; See <i>Buck v. The King</i>, <i>supra</i>, as an example.&nbsp; At page&nbsp;149, the judgment of Anglin&nbsp;J., on which my colleague relies, refers to the fact that the evidence before the Extradition Commissioner in the United States included "proof of the Canadian law".</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

Allard</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;861, at p.&nbsp;865.&nbsp; To create such obligation, it is necessary to enter into treaties.&nbsp; So far as the international obligations of Canada (and for that matter other states) are concerned, therefore, they must be found within the confines of the treaties.&nbsp; Of course, some assistance may be found in the practices followed by other states and there is considerable similarity in the practices of different states.&nbsp; In discussing these practices, international writers have for convenience identified certain principles or "rules" such as double criminality and so on.&nbsp; These are convenient labels, and this international practice, as noted in <i>Allard</i> (at p.&nbsp;865), "may no doubt have a certain value in interpreting the law", but in the end the international duty must be found in the terms of the appropriate treaty.&nbsp; This was the position taken by this Court in <i>R. v. Parisien</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;950.</span></p>

La Forest, at pp.&nbsp;5-6 (hereafter "<i>La&nbsp;Forest's Extradition</i>, 3rd ed.").</span></p>

Jur.&nbsp;281, and <i>R. v. Governor of Brixton Prison, ex p.&nbsp;Minervini</i>, [1958] 3 All E.R. 318 (Q.B.).</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At all events, most of the treaties bear a considerable similarity to one another.&nbsp; Thus from the earliest days to the present, many of the treaties contain provisions such as those in the treaty in this case that speak of "reciprocal extradition" or require that crimes be punishable by at least one year's imprisonment in both states.&nbsp; So there is no substance to the argument that the existence of these provisions in the treaty under consideration here makes it different from other treaties.&nbsp; A number of others deal with the situation by restricting surrender to indictable offences or types of offences of equivalent seriousness in the foreign state.&nbsp; The early treaties are reproduced in the Appendix to F. Piggott's <i>Extradition:&nbsp; A Treatise on the Law Relating to Fugitive Offenders</i> (1910); references to existing treaties applicable to Canada appear in <i>La Forest's Extradition</i>, 3rd ed., App.&nbsp;II, at pp.&nbsp;359 <i>et seq.</i>&nbsp; There are, to be sure, some variations in language and substance but, given the nature of the implementing statute, it should not be readily assumed that these changes are in fundamental disaccord with the structure of the Act.&nbsp; This assertion is buttressed&nbsp; by the remarkable similarity between cases considering different treaties, both in Canada and Great Britain.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

C. Blanchflower, "Interpretation and Application of Extradition Crime in the Extradition Act" (1992), 34 <i>Crim.&nbsp;L.Q.</i> 158, at p.&nbsp;171.&nbsp; This pre-Confederation practice, which had the advantage of expediting the extradition process, has generally been followed to this day.&nbsp; In practice, it would appear, the crime as it is known in the foreign state is set forth in the information and warrant of arrest, and this leaves it up to the extradition judge to identify the equivalent Canadian crime at the hearing; see <i>ibid.</i>, at p.&nbsp;162.&nbsp; As Borins Co. Ct. J. (as he then was) put it in <i>Re United States of America and Smith</i> (1984), 15 C.C.C.&nbsp;(3d) 16 (Ont.&nbsp;Co.&nbsp;Ct.), at p.&nbsp;27 (aff'd 16 C.C.C. (3d) 10 (Ont. H.C.)):&nbsp; "It is the task of the extradition court to fit a set of facts constituting the conduct of the alleged fugitive, not into the legal framework set up by the applicant government, but into Canadian legislation to determine if the alleged conduct constitutes an offence pursuant to that legislation."&nbsp; This does not ordinarily pose any problem because most Canadian extradition cases are with the United States and as a general rule the same criminal act or conduct falls within an offence of the same name in both countries.&nbsp; There is, however, much to be said for Blanchflower's view (<i>supra</i>, pp.&nbsp;171-74) that the information in support of the warrant of arrest should set forth the name of the Canadian offence in the first place; it would be a better practice and avoid confusion.&nbsp; But s.&nbsp;10(1) is not explicit on the point and either practice is valid.&nbsp; Consistent with the general principle that extradition laws should be liberally construed so as to achieve the purposes of the treaty, a much less technical approach to extradition warrants than to common law warrants has been adopted; see <i>La&nbsp;Forest's Extradition</i>, 3rd ed., at pp.&nbsp;128-29.</span></p>

(<i>b</i>) of the definition of extradition crime (R.S.C., 1985, c. E-23, s. 2) was to ensure that the Act would automatically apply to additional crimes set forth in new treaties, just as those new treaties were automatically implemented by the Act.&nbsp; It would be anomalous indeed if different regimes were established for crimes listed in the Schedule and those listed in the treaty alone.&nbsp; Indeed, this Court has recently decided that this is not the case.&nbsp; In interpreting s.&nbsp;34 (which provides that the crimes in Schedule I are to be construed <u>in accordance with the law of Canada</u>), the Court in <i>Allard</i>, <i>supra</i>, stated, at p.&nbsp;867:</span></p>

Postlethwaite</i>, [1987] 3 W.L.R. 365 (H.L.), at p.&nbsp;390, expressed a similar doubt.&nbsp; Such monitoring could lead to endless delays in a procedure intended to be expeditious.&nbsp; As Lord Templeman put it in <i>Postlethwaite</i>, at p.&nbsp;392:&nbsp; "The progress of committal proceedings is a matter for the magistrate who, in practice, deals with extradition proceedings with the utmost despatch consistently with the needs of the prosecution and the requirements of the defence."&nbsp; More recently in <i>Sinclair</i>, Lord Ackner, also speaking for all the Law Lords, made it clear (at p.&nbsp;89) that "monitoring the provisions of the Treaty is an executive, and not a magisterial, function".&nbsp; In Canada, though there has been scant discussion of the theoretical foundations of the issue, there has in practice been little recourse to the niceties of the treaty provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel and judges have properly confined themselves within the four corners of the Act.&nbsp; Recently, however, counsel have extended their submissions to matters comprised in treaty provisions.&nbsp; The present case itself indicates the possibilities for endless delays as counsel and judges attempt to navigate an unfamiliar sea.&nbsp; In England, there has been a tendency (though fairly recent) to advance these treaty arguments at extradition hearings, leading to horrendously difficult cases that only the most determined can read or understand.&nbsp; A number of these are described in <i>Sinclair</i>.&nbsp; The recent cases have established that this incorporation of treaty provisions into the Act has never been the intent of the Act or the treaties.&nbsp; No provision in the Act is to this effect and the English courts have recently put an end to the practice that had developed.&nbsp; Lord Ackner concludes the relevant part of his reasons on the following note (at pp.&nbsp;91-92):&nbsp; "Certainly for the future, if your Lordships concur that the magistrate has no jurisdiction to decide .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether the requirements of the Treaty have been satisfied, his powers being limited to those specified in sections 3(1), 8, 9 and 10, much time should be saved both in the magistrates' and in the Divisional Court."</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some perspective may be gained through reflection on what an extradition treaty is.&nbsp; It is an agreement between two sovereign states whereby each agrees to surrender on request persons alleged to have committed crimes in the state requesting the surrender.&nbsp; To this general obligation, states frequently attach terms and conditions.&nbsp; When a request is made, the political authorities in the requested state will examine the material to see that the request complies with these terms and conditions.&nbsp; The treaties also make provision for the requesting state to supply certain material whereby the requested state can determine the validity of the request and its compliance with the terms and conditions of the treaty (see Art. 9 of the treaty here (Can. T.S.&nbsp;1976 No.&nbsp;3)), and it is reasonable that these are the materials to be looked at in determining the issue.&nbsp; In essence, the treaty obligations are of a political character to be dealt with in the absence of statute by the political authorities.&nbsp; However, as Laskin J. noted in <i>Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R.&nbsp;228, at p.&nbsp;245, the liberty of the individual has not been forgotten in these rather special proceedings.&nbsp; The treaties, sensitive to the liberty of the individual, contain provisions for their protection.&nbsp; Most important is the requirement that there be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the act charged would constitute a crime in Canada.&nbsp; This specific matter, about which judges are most competent, is the task assigned to a judge by the <i>Extradition Act</i>.&nbsp; Other tasks, no doubt, may be assigned to extradition judges, but one must find a statutory source, and courts should not reach out to bring within their jurisdictional ambit matters that the Act has not assigned to them.&nbsp; Barring statutory provision, the task of dealing with international treaty obligations is for the political authorities, and is performed by the Ministers and departments in the course of fulfilling their appropriate mandates.&nbsp; The <i>Extradition Act</i>, of course, gives the Minister of Justice authority respecting the surrender of a fugitive; see ss.&nbsp;20 - 22 and 25.&nbsp; The treaty terms are aimed at the obligations of the parties and not the internal procedures by which these are to be carried into effect.&nbsp; The spirit in which the treaties should be approached is well stated by Lord Bridge in <i>Postlethwaite</i>, <i>supra</i>, as follows, at pp.&nbsp;383-84:</span></p>

Governor of Ashford Remand Centre, Ex parte Beese</i> [1973] 1 W.L.R. 969, 973, <i>per</i> Lord Widgery C.J.&nbsp; In applying this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. principle, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it must be remembered that the reciprocal rights and obligations which the high contracting parties confer and accept are intended to serve the purpose of bringing to justice those who are guilty of grave crimes committed in either of the contracting states.&nbsp; To apply to extradition treaties the strict canons appropriate to the construction of domestic legislation would often tend to defeat rather than to serve this purpose.</span></p>

Piot</i> (1883), 48 L.T. 120; <i>Re Gross</i> (1898), 2 C.C.C. 67 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Ex parte Thomas</i> (1917), 28 C.C.C. 396.&nbsp; If discussion of issues of that kind can now only be found in early cases, it is presumably because the principle that the technicalities of criminal law only apply to a limited extent in extradition cases is now well understood by the courts.</span></p>

Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; It conceded, however, that the central point in <i>Johnson</i> was the reverse of the one it had to decide.&nbsp; In short, what the Court decided in <i>Johnson</i> was that it had to be established that the crime for which a fugitive is sought would constitute a crime listed in the treaty <u>according to the law of Canada</u>.&nbsp; This, in my view, is of critical importance.&nbsp; In coming to its conclusion, the Court of Appeal in the present case was obviously affected by a reference to the definition of extradition crime in my text (2nd ed.), <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;42, which had been cited by Wilson J.&nbsp; I do not resile from that definition as a broad description viewed from the perspective of the whole of the extradition process, but modesty forbids (as well I fear the ordinary rules of statutory construction) that I use it in construing the Act in lieu of the definition set forth in the Act itself.&nbsp; I shall have more to say later about comprehensive definitions of this kind.&nbsp; They are addressed to the whole of the extradition process, and are not confined to the proceedings before the extradition judge.&nbsp; For the moment, however, it is important to observe that my former colleague did not cite the definition in my book as a substitute for that set forth in the Act.&nbsp; She has always been too astute to do me that much honour.&nbsp; Under the heading "Extradition Crimes" she refers solely to the definition of that term in the Act; similarly, as we shall see, when she came to deal with the issue directly before her, she did so on the basis of the statutory definition.&nbsp; On the other hand, she cites the definition in my book along with Shearer, <i>supra</i>, p.&nbsp;137, for the proposition central to her judgment that the "double criminality" rule looks to the <u>conduct</u> of the individual; it does not engage a comparison of offences in the two countries.&nbsp; For a crime to be an extradition crime, she reasons, it must be an act that is not only an offence in the requesting state but must also be one in the requested state that is listed in the treaty.&nbsp; At no time, however, does she state that it is for the extradition judge to determine that the act charged is a crime in the requesting state.&nbsp; And when she deals with the function of the extradition judge, which is what she was, of course, directly concerned with, she refers to the definition in the <i>Extradition Act</i>.&nbsp; This she does in discussing the application of the "double criminality rule" (at pp.&nbsp;342-43).&nbsp; Throughout she confines herself to the task of determining whether the act charged amounts to a crime listed in the treaty as understood by Canadian law.&nbsp; This is consistent with what she deems to be the underlying purpose of the rule of double criminality, that no person shall be surrendered for an act (or conduct) in another country unless that act or conduct is considered a crime here.&nbsp; For this proposition, she cites (at pp.&nbsp;341-42) the following passage from Shearer, at pp.&nbsp;137-38:</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Nielsen</i>, it will be remembered, Lord Diplock, speaking for the House of Lords, held that barring express treaty provision, all that had to be established at an extradition hearing was a <i>prima facie</i> case that the fugitive's conduct in the requesting state would, if committed in England, constitute a listed crime according to the law of England.&nbsp; In <i>Nielsen</i> there was no treaty provision affecting the matter, so the fugitive was committed for surrender.&nbsp; In <i>obiter</i>, however, Lord Diplock expressed the view that a treaty may expressly require proof of foreign law at an extradition hearing, noting that this would have been the case if the request had been made under the supplementary treaty with Denmark.&nbsp; That treaty had simply amended the principal treaty dealt with in <i>Nielsen</i> by adding the rather unusual provision (cited by my colleague) to the effect that the parties to the treaty may in their discretion surrender fugitives for other crimes than those listed in the treaty, but only in the case where the conduct is an extradition crime according to the law of both countries.&nbsp; In such a case, it would be necessary in Lord Diplock's view to hear evidence of Danish law.&nbsp; I should in light of the subsequent developments observe that Lord Diplock's comments qualified the reasons of Robert Goff L.J. in the Divisional Court (1983), 79 Cr.App.R. 1, of which he had taken pains to "record my respectful admiration" (at p. 620).&nbsp; In the Divisional Court it had been made plain that the magistrate at an extradition hearing was not concerned with foreign law at all.&nbsp; It agreed, however, that questions of foreign law would, of course, arise before the Secretary of State, in the course of ensuring compliance with the treaty.</span></p>

III(1)(<i>a</i>), which, like Art. 2(1) of the treaty here, provided that extradition shall be granted only if "the offence is punishable under the laws of both Parties by imprisonment or other form of detention for more than one year .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."&nbsp; Since it had been established at the extradition hearing that these two requirements (i.e. that the act was a crime in the United States and that it was punishable in the manner specified in Art. III(1)(<i>a</i>)) were satisfied by affidavits, nothing turned on the point.&nbsp; That is equally the case here.&nbsp; No issue is raised that the act charged is not a crime in California, or that it is punishable there by less than one year's imprisonment.&nbsp; All that is in issue, as I noted at the outset, is whether it is necessary to prove that the act charged constitutes a crime listed in the treaty under the law of the requesting state.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, <i>McCaffery</i> decided, is not necessary, and so if one accepts <i>Nielsen</i> and <i>McCaffery</i>, that is sufficient to dispose of the present case.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Diplock's view was struck a glancing blow by the House of Lords in <i>Postlethwaite</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 390-91, a case that involved a clause in the United Kingdom's treaty with Belgium that prohibited surrender unless the crime was "punishable according to the laws in force in both countries".&nbsp; The fugitive was accused of manslaughter in Belgium and it was argued that the expert evidence of a Belgian lawyer, presented at the extradition hearing to show that manslaughter remains a crime in Belgium, had not been presented within two months of the fugitive's arrest as required by the treaty, although an affidavit to fill "the supposed lacuna" had been received in the Divisional Court proceedings.&nbsp; Lord Bridge found this contention wholly devoid of merit.&nbsp; He began his analysis by expressing doubt about whether this was an issue for the magistrate at all, saying at p. 390:&nbsp; "Assuming that this was a matter for the magistrate and not for the Secretary of State, which I doubt but will not take time to consider further .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."&nbsp; The reason he found it unnecessary to consider the matter in depth was that, in his view, it could surely be presumed that so serious a crime was punishable.&nbsp; But in any event, he held, there was evidence.&nbsp; That evidence was the Belgian warrant for his arrest, which set forth the nature of the Belgian offence, and a deposition by a Belgian official accompanying the requisition that showed that the offence was contrary to the Belgian Penal Code. Such evidence is, of course, present in the case at bar.&nbsp; What one gathers from <i>Postlethwaite</i> is that the question of whether a crime is one under foreign law is for the Secretary of State to determine on the basis of the material required under the treaty to be supplied with the requisition.</span></p>

Johnson</i>, decided by this Court in 1988.&nbsp; This case, of course, preceded <i>Sinclair</i>, but it came after <i>Nielsen</i>, <i>McCaffery</i> and <i>Postlethwaite</i>.&nbsp; No mention was made of these cases except for an oblique, and for present purposes irrelevant reference (at p. 344) to <i>Nielsen</i>.&nbsp; Wilson J.'s reference to Art. 2(1) is terse, probably because the case was not really argued in these terms.&nbsp; All Wilson J. directly says about it (at p. 339) is as follows:&nbsp; "This is the double criminality rule, the precise nature of which is in issue on this appeal".&nbsp; When she deals with the application of the double criminality rule, she does not concern herself with whether the crime is one in the requesting state (except under the special procedure relating to convicts to determine whether the crime of which the fugitive was convicted would be one under Canadian law).&nbsp; Still less does she consider whether it should be the extradition judge or the executive that decides the issue of whether the act charged is a crime in the requesting state.&nbsp; She deals solely with the issue of whether the conduct of the accused would constitute a crime in Canada, which is all the <i>Extradition Act</i>, upon which she relied, required her to do.&nbsp; I add that she would have been prepared to commit the fugitive had his impugned conduct amounted to a crime against Canadian law, without reference to United States law.&nbsp; I repeat:&nbsp; all she considered, and this was really the only question before her, was whether the conduct constituted a crime in Canada.&nbsp; She held that this was not established and accordingly concluded that the fugitive should be released.&nbsp; The minority, for its part, found that the particular facts revealed an offence under Canadian law and would have ordered the fugitive's committal on that basis.&nbsp; In short, Wilson J., and for that matter the minority judges, did not really consider whether it was up to the extradition judge, as opposed to the executive, to consider the foreign law side of the concept of double criminality.</span></p>

X of the <i>Treaty between Her Majesty and the United States of America, to Settle and Define the Boundaries between the Possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America and the Territories of the United States; for the Final Suppression of the African Slave Trade; and for the Giving Up of Criminals, Fugitive from Justice, in Certain Cases</i> (<i>Ashburton-Webster Treaty</i>) (1842), contained no such clause; see Can. T.S. 1952 No. 12.&nbsp; Finally, I note that the present treaty is meant "to make more effective the co-operation of the two countries in the repression of crime".</span></p>

Attorney General of Canada</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 219, at p. 222.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">To act differently here would take us back to the approach followed in England in the 19th century when the judges by a strict and narrow interpretation frustrated the operation of the few extradition treaties it had entered into.&nbsp; The British Act of 1870, on which ours is modelled, was intended to change this approach.&nbsp; Lord Diplock explains this in <i>Nielsen</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 614-15.&nbsp; He states:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

T.S. 1991 No. 37.&nbsp; This development comes from a realization that what is really important is that a person should not be surrendered to another country for conduct that is not considered a serious crime in the requested country.&nbsp; If that basic and important task is done, and prosecution for other offences is barred following surrender, I see no reason to complicate the extradition process by requiring proof of foreign law before the extradition judge.&nbsp; The monitoring of the treaty to ensure compliance by the foreign state with the treaty obligations&nbsp; can safely be left to the executive, as the Canadian scheme of extradition contemplates.&nbsp; It should be observed, however, that Art. 2(1) in the new treaty is much the same as in the treaty at issue here: if my colleague's view of that provision is accepted, then, the contracting parties have not yet succeeded in avoiding proof of foreign law at the extradition hearing.</span></p>

E-23, read in conjunction with s. 2 (the definition of an "extradition crime") and s. 34.&nbsp; The procedure mandated by these provisions protects the accused against being surrendered to another country for conduct not regarded as criminal in Canada.&nbsp; Along with the treaty provision that the offence for which the fugitive is surrendered is the only offence for which, under the treaty, he can be prosecuted in the requesting state, the accused is adequately protected.&nbsp; As such, there is no point to a review of foreign law by the extradition judge, and as <i>Argentina v. Mellino</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 536, at pp. 554-55, reminds us, it is not the business of that judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the decisions of the officials and judicial authorities in the foreign state.</span></p>
