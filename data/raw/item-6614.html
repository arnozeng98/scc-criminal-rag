200%"><span lang="EN-GB">Production of disciplinary records and criminal investigation files in the possession of the police that do not fall within the scope of this first party disclosure package is governed by the <i>O’Connor</i> regime for third party production.&nbsp; The <i>O’Connor </i>procedure provides a general mechanism at common law for ordering production of any record beyond the possession or control of the prosecuting Crown, and is not limited to cases where third party records attract a reasonable expectation of privacy.&nbsp; To limit the applicability of the <i>O’Connor</i> regime to those cases where a third party has an expectation of privacy in the targeted documents would raise some uncertainty concerning the appropriate mechanism for accessing third party records when it is unknown whether a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches.&nbsp; [11] [15]</span></p>

200%"><span lang="EN-GB">In most cases, a useful starting point for courts in balancing the competing interests at the second stage of an <i>O’Connor</i> application will be to assess the true relevancy of the targeted record in the case against the accused.&nbsp; Once a court has ascertained upon inspection that third party records are indeed relevant to the accused’s case, in the sense that they pertain to an issue in the trial, the second stage balancing exercise is easily performed.&nbsp; In effect, a finding of true relevance puts the third party records in the same category for disclosure purposes as the fruits of the investigation against the accused in the hands of the prosecuting Crown under <i>Stinchcombe.</i>&nbsp; It may be useful to pose the question in this way: If the third party record in question had found its way into the Crown prosecutor’s file, would there be any basis under the first party <i>Stinchcombe</i> disclosure regime for not disclosing it to the accused?&nbsp; If the answer to that question is no, there can be no principled reason to arrive at a different outcome on the third party production application.&nbsp; The accused’s interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making full answer and defence will, as a general rule, outweigh any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material.&nbsp; This is particularly so in respect of criminal investigation files concerning third party accused.&nbsp; [20] [39] [42]</span></p>

200%"><span lang="EN-GB">That is not to say that residual privacy interests in the contents of criminal investigation files, police disciplinary records or any other third party records should be disregarded.&nbsp; The court should ensure that a production order is properly tailored to meet the exigencies of the case but do no more.&nbsp; To ensure that only relevant material is produced and that no unwarranted invasion of privacy interests occurs, the court may find it necessary to make a production order subject to redactions or other conditions.&nbsp; In addition, when just and appropriate to do so, the court may well impose restrictions on the dissemination of the information produced for purposes unrelated to the accused’s full answer and defence or prosecution of an appeal. &nbsp;[43‑44] [46]</span></p>

P.15, and to criminal charges.&nbsp; Both proceedings against Hackett were ongoing at the time.&nbsp; Following an aborted application to reopen his trial to introduce evidence about Hackett’s misconduct, McNeil chose to proceed to sentence and appeal his conviction instead.</p>

With the targeted documents before it, the court weighs “the positive and negative consequences of production, with a view to determining whether, and to what extent, production should be ordered” (<i>O’Connor</i>, at para. 137).&nbsp; The second part of the <i>O’Connor</i> test essentially requires a court to conduct a balancing of the third party’s privacy interest in the targeted documents, if any, and the accused’s interest in making full answer and defence.</p>

line-height:200%">[10]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>As stated earlier, the third party record holders in this case seek clarification in respect of some of the uncertainties arising from the decision below.&nbsp; The issues canvassed before this Court are the following.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:200%">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>First, by limiting the applicability of the <i>O’Connor</i> production regime to those cases where a third party has an expectation of privacy in the targeted documents, the decision under appeal raises some uncertainty concerning the appropriate mechanism for accessing third party records when it is unknown whether a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches.&nbsp; As I will explain, the procedure set out in <i>O’Connor</i> provides a general mechanism at common law for ordering production of <i>any</i> record beyond the possession or control of the prosecuting Crown.&nbsp; Whether or not the targeted record is subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy is one of the questions that must be determined at the hearing of an <i>O’Connor </i>application.&nbsp; For that pragmatic reason alone,&nbsp; the operation&nbsp; of the common law production regime cannot be premised on the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Second, to the extent that the decision in the court below suggests that there can be no expectation of privacy in the contents of a criminal investigation file, it is in error.&nbsp; As this Court stated in <i>R. v. Mills</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668:&nbsp; “Privacy is not an all or nothing right.&nbsp; It does not follow from the fact that the Crown has possession of the records that any reasonable expectation of privacy disappears” (para. 108).&nbsp; This principle holds equally in respect of criminal investigation files relating to third party accused that are <i>not </i>in the possession or control of the prosecuting Crown.&nbsp; There can be no assumption that criminal investigation files relating to third party accused persons do not attract an expectation of privacy absent consideration of their particular contents and other relevant factors.&nbsp; The existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy and its impact, if any, on a third party’s obligation to produce is always a contextual, fact-based inquiry.&nbsp; Likewise, no blanket ruling can be made in respect of privacy interests in police disciplinary records without regard to their contents.</p>

line-height:200%">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Third, to the extent that the operative terms of the production order below may suggest that records in possession of one Crown entity are deemed to be in the possession of another, this interpretation should be discarded.&nbsp; The notion that all state authorities constitute a single indivisible Crown entity for the purposes of disclosure finds no support in law and, moreover, is unworkable in practice.&nbsp; Accordingly, Crown entities other than the prosecuting Crown are third parties under the <i>O’Connor</i> production regime.&nbsp; As I will explain, however, this does not relieve the prosecuting Crown from its obligation to make reasonable inquiries of other Crown entities and other third parties, in appropriate cases, with respect to records and information in their possession that may be relevant to the case being prosecuted.&nbsp; The Crown and the defence in a criminal proceeding are not adverse in interest for the purpose of&nbsp; discovering relevant information that may be of benefit to an accused.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%">[14]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>In addition to clarifying these three uncertainties, this case provides an appropriate context within which to reiterate the respective obligations of the police and the Crown to disclose the fruits of the investigation under <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, and to consider the extent to which relevant police disciplinary records and third party criminal investigation files should form part of this “first party” disclosure package.&nbsp; The Crown’s obligation to disclose all relevant information in its possession to an accused is well established at common law and is now constitutionally entrenched in the right to full answer and defence under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">s. 7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The necessary corollary to the Crown’s disclosure duty under <i>Stinchcombe</i> is the obligation of police (or other investigating state authority) to disclose to the Crown all material pertaining to its investigation of the accused.&nbsp; For the purposes of fulfilling this corollary obligation, the investigating police force, although distinct and independent from the Crown at law, is not a third party.&nbsp; Rather, it acts on the same first party footing as the Crown.</p>

It would be impossible to carry out 1% of that task.&nbsp; It would take many years to bring every case to trial if that were required.</p>

Clifford</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 3 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 48-49. &nbsp;An equivalent presumption of privacy does not attach in respect of all third party records that fall outside the <i>Mills</i> regime.&nbsp; Hence, any balancing of competing interests is reserved for the second stage of the <i>O’Connor</i> regime, when the documents can be inspected by the court to better ascertain the nature of the privacy interest, if any.&nbsp; Because of these significant differences, it is important not to transpose the <i>Mills</i> regime into the <i>O’Connor</i> production hearing in respect of documents to which the statutory dispositions do not apply.</p>

line-height:200%">[54]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>When the police misconduct in question concerns the same incident that forms the subject-matter of the charge against the accused, the police duty to disclose information concerning police disciplinary action taken in respect of that misconduct is rather self-evident.&nbsp; To state an obvious example, if a police officer is charged under the applicable provincial legislation for excessive use of force in relation to the accused’s arrest, this information must be disclosed to the Crown.&nbsp; Where the misconduct of a police witness is not directly related to the investigation against the accused, it may nonetheless be relevant to the accused’s case, in which case it should also be disclosed.&nbsp; For example, no one would question that the criminal record for perjury of a civilian material witness would be of relevance to the accused and should form part of the first party disclosure package.&nbsp; In the same way, findings of police misconduct by a police officer involved in the case against the accused that may have a bearing on the case against an accused should be disclosed.</p>

line-height:200%">[55]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The need for guidance in this area prompted a review commissioned by the Chief of the Toronto Police Service.&nbsp; The review was conducted by the Honourable George Ferguson, Q.C., and culminated in his January 2003 report entitled <i>Review and Recommendations Concerning Various Aspects of Police Misconduct</i>, vol. I (the “Ferguson Report”).&nbsp; The terms of reference included the mandate to review “when, in what manner and under what circumstances does the Police Service have an obligation to bring to the attention of the Crown, alleged or proven acts of misconduct of a police officer who will be a witness or was otherwise involved in an investigation that has led to a criminal proceeding” (p. 1).</p>

line-height:200%">[56]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The Ferguson Report noted that the question of disclosure of such information was usually left to be determined in the context of an <i>O’Connor</i> application for third party production and that this often gave rise to a “Catch-22” problem, stating as follows (at p. 12):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
200%">Once into <i>O’Connor</i>, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the defence to meet the threshold required to access the records. Unless the officer is notorious or the defence personally knows details of the officer’s files, the defence will be found to be on nothing more than a fishing expedition and access will be denied.&nbsp; A diligent officer‑in‑charge will not likely know the full employment history of each police witness, and, currently, is not required to make any inquiries.&nbsp; Short of a criminal conviction for dishonesty, nothing is likely to be provided to the Crown for disclosure analysis.&nbsp; Even convictions for dishonesty may not always be revealed.&nbsp; This is clearly unsatisfactory.</p>
