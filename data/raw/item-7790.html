Moreover, “imprisonment” does not bear a uniform meaning for all purposes of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; In several instances, as in s.&nbsp;732, “sentence of imprisonment” or “term of imprisonment” necessarily contemplate incarceration in a manner that cannot include conditional sentences.&nbsp; As well, a harmonious reading of the English and French versions of s.&nbsp;732 clarifies that it contemplates only custodial sentences.

line-height:200%">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>In arriving at an opposite conclusion, Justice Cromwell relies on the principle of statutory interpretation which favours giving a word or phrase “the same interpretation or meaning whenever it appears in an act”, unless “the contrary is clearly indicated by the context” (<i>Thomson v. Canada (Deputy Minister of Agriculture)</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 385, at p. 400).&nbsp; Applying this same rule of interpretation, it seems to me plain that a conditional sentence is <i>not</i> a “sentence of imprisonment” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;732(1). As mentioned at the outset, s. 732(1)(<i>b</i>) contemplates sentences that are served “in confinement” and probation orders “on release from prison after completing the intermittent sentence”.&nbsp; Conditional sentences are, by definition, meant to be served in the community and not in prisons.&nbsp; To conclude that they are sentences of imprisonment within the meaning of s. 732(1) is thus inconsistent with a purposive and contextual interpretation of the provision, and also the express terms adopted by Parliament in providing for intermittent sentences.</p>

It is thus hardly surprising that no intermittent conditional sentences of imprisonment —&nbsp;an anomalous notion at best — have been brought to our attention.&nbsp;</p>

In practice, the determination of a term of imprisonment is necessarily intertwined with the decision of where the offender will serve the sentence. A judge does not impose a fixed sentence of “x months” in the abstract, without having in mind where that sentence will be served . . . . Furthermore, when a conditional sentence is chosen, its duration will depend on the type of conditions imposed. Therefore, <u>the duration of the sentence should not be determined separately from the determination of its venue</u>.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</p>

Justice Cromwell agrees that a conditional sentence cannot be served intermittently.&nbsp; He nonetheless finds that “sentence of imprisonment” in s. 732(1) refers to both custodial and conditional sentences.&nbsp; My colleague rests this conclusion on his proposed distinction between a sentence of imprisonment and the manner in which it is served. But this distinction hardly explains why “sentence of imprisonment” in s. 732(1) — which concerns custodial sentences, since only custodial sentences <i>can be served intermittently</i> — refers to both custodial <i>and </i>conditional sentences.</p>

(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).&nbsp; If the later references to “sentence” do not include a conditional sentence (as I believe to be the case) because a conditional sentence intermittently, the opening reference to “a sentence” also excludes conditional sentences.&nbsp; Conditional sentences therefore do not get in the door of s. 732(1) and, on this view, there is no need to attribute different meanings to the same word (“sentence”) in the same subsection.&nbsp; Textually and contextually, s. 732(1) simply does not extend to conditional sentences.</p>

To hold that a conditional sentence of imprisonment is a sentence of imprisonment gives effect to the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words used in the provision. In my respectful view, there is nothing in the context or scheme of the relevant legislation that suggests that we should give these words any other meaning.</p>

He received a 90-day intermittent sentence of imprisonment to be served on weekends and two 18-month concurrent conditional sentences of imprisonment to be served in the community. He also received a period of probation, which is not in issue. The sentence gives rise to two issues.</p>

line-height:200%">[63]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The first is whether an intermittent sentence was available. The<i> Code</i> gives courts the power to order that a sentence of imprisonment be served intermittently —&nbsp;&nbsp; for example on weekends —&nbsp; rather than on consecutive days. But the <i>Code</i> limits this power to sentences of imprisonment of 90 days or less. At issue is whether the 18-month concurrent conditional sentences of imprisonment which the judge imposed are sentences of imprisonment. The parties agree that if they are, an intermittent sentence was not available here because, taking the conditional sentences into account, the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the judge was longer than 90 days.</p>

The <i>Code</i> provides that when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on a person who is subject to an intermittent sentence, the unexpired portion of the intermittent sentence will be served on consecutive days (in other words, not intermittently) unless the court otherwise orders. At issue is the effect of this provision in this case. Does it require that the intermittent sentence be served on consecutive days because the judge, having imposed a sentence of imprisonment on a person who was at that moment already subject to an intermittent sentence, did not expressly order otherwise?</p>

My view is that the judge could not order an intermittent sentence here because the 18-month conditional sentences of imprisonment which he imposed are sentences of imprisonment. He therefore imposed a sentence of imprisonment of more than 90 days and the <i>Code</i> provides that, in these circumstances, an intermittent sentence cannot be imposed. As to the second issue, I am of the view that the sentencing judge should be understood to have ordered that the intermittent sentence (if legal) would continue to be served intermittently.&nbsp; The judge at the same hearing imposed an intermittent sentence and, virtually in the same breath, another period of imprisonment. In these circumstances, he should be understood to have directed that the intermittent sentence was to be served intermittently.</p>

line-height:200%">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The judge in this case faced a difficult problem and he thought that an intermittent sentence of imprisonment was part of the solution. The judge found the offender, Mr. Middleton, guilty after trial of a number of acts of domestic violence arising from two incidents (2006 CarswellOnt 9387). The first, in September 2004, included an assault that left the appellant’s fiancée, who is the mother of his young daughter, with a broken clavicle. The second, in February 2005, included threats and pointing a pellet gun. The judge rightly sought to denounce and deter this sort of senseless brutality and to protect the appellant’s fiancée and others. But he was also concerned about the financial impact of a jail sentence on Mr. Middleton’s daughter. The judge did not want Mr. Middleton’s punishment to deprive his child of the court-ordered financial support he was capable of providing through his well-paid employment.</p>

This, the judge thought, would meet the need to impose “a real jail sentence” while at the same time allowing Mr. Middleton “to maintain [his] employment and to continue to support [his] daughter pursuant to the Court Order” (2006 CarswellOnt 9388, at paras. 6-7).</p>

line-height:200%">[70]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>There is a distinction that is critical to an understanding of the rather technical issues in this appeal.&nbsp; It is the distinction between the question of whether a particular sentence is, in law, a “sentence of imprisonment” and the question of how that “sentence of imprisonment” is to be served.&nbsp; In short, the distinction is between the nature of the sentence and the manner in which it is to be served. While imprisonment generally results from a sentence of imprisonment, not all sentences of imprisonment result in the offender being imprisoned while serving that sentence.&nbsp; The <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> </i>and the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1992-c-20-en" target="_blank">Corrections and Conditional Release Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1992-c-20-en" target="_blank">, S.C. 1992, c. 20<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> (“<i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/sc-1992-c-20-en" target="_blank">CCRA<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>”), provide that sentences of imprisonment may be served in various ways.&nbsp; The critical point is that the manner in which the sentence is served does not alter its nature as a sentence of imprisonment. Contrary to my colleague Fish J.’s suggestion, the existence of this distinction is not inconsistent with the principle enunciated by this Court in <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, that the duration of the sentence should not be determined separately from the determination of its venue. Rather, <i>Proulx</i> recognizes the distinction between the legal nature of the sentence as a sentence of imprisonment and an order respecting the manner in which it is to be served.</p>

This is clear from the text of s. 742.1 of the <i>Code</i>. Where “the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years&nbsp;. . . the court may . . . order that the offender serve the sentence in the community”.&nbsp; A conditional sentence is a sentence of imprisonment which the court directs to be served in the community.&nbsp;</p>

Similarly, we find in s. 128(1) that an offender “who is released on parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence continues, while entitled to be at large, to serve the sentence until its expiration according to law”.

The appellant points out in his factum, at para. 36, that “[s]entencing jurisprudence regarding s. 732(1) and the section’s predecessor, has long established that two separate intermittent sentences cannot be made consecutive to each other if the aggregate sentence exceeds the <i>Code</i>’s ninety day maximum.”&nbsp; The appellate court decisions that the appellant cites as authority for this proposition turn on their interpretation of s. 14(1) of the <i>Parole Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c.

The words relating to confinement and prison in s. 732(1)(<i>b</i>) are used in connection with the manner in which the sentence of imprisonment is to be served.

That section directs a court imposing a sentence to consider “all available sanctions <u>other than imprisonment</u> that are reasonable in the circumstances”. The Court in <i>Proulx</i> held that the term “imprisonment” in s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) should be understood to refer to actual incarceration. In other words, the term “imprisonment” in s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) should be understood to refer to the manner in which the sentence is to be served — i.e. in prison —&nbsp; rather than to the nature of the sentence itself —&nbsp; i.e. a “sentence of imprisonment”. The Crown submits that we should apply the same interpretation of “imprisonment” in s. 732. The Crown’s argument in my respectful view misapprehends the nature of the interpretive exercise in <i>Proulx</i> and overlooks the distinction between the nature of a sentence and the manner in which it is to be served.</p>

line-height:200%">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>The Court in <i>Proulx </i>was faced with equally authoritative English and French versions of s. 718.2(<i>e</i>), only one of which made sense in context, given Parliament’s intention to reduce the rate of incarceration in Canada. The use of the word “imprisonment” in the English version, if interpreted as including a conditional sentence order that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community, would have precluded the use of conditional sentence orders to achieve that objective. The French text of the section, however, made it clear this was not Parliament’s intent. <span lang="FR-CA">It directed “<i>l’examen de toutes <u>les sanctions substitutives applicables</u> qui sont justifiées dans les circonstances</i>”. </span>In short, the conflict between the two official language versions of the provision, coupled with the fact that reading the term “imprisonment” in s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) as including a conditional sentence was exactly contrary to the obvious legislative intent, made it clear that the term “imprisonment” in the English version of s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) should be understood to refer to the manner in which the sentence of imprisonment was to be served rather than to all sentences of imprisonment, no matter how served. As Lamer C.J. explained:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt">The use of “<i>sanctions substitutives</i>” for “sanctions other than imprisonment” in the French version of this provision means that s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) plays a role not only in the decision as to whether imprisonment or probationary measures should be imposed (preliminary step of the analysis), but also in the decision as to whether to impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment since conditional sentences are clearly “<i>sanctions substitutives</i>” to incarceration.</p>

In conformity with a long‑standing principle of interpretation, to resolve the conflict between the two official versions, we have to look for the meaning common to both: [citations omitted]. Accordingly, the word “imprisonment” in s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) should be interpreted as “incarceration” rather than in its technical sense of encompassing both incarceration and a conditional sentence. Read in this light, s. 718.2(<i>e</i>) clearly exerts an influence on the sentencing judge’s determination as to whether to impose a conditional sentence as opposed to a jail term. [paras. 94-95]</p>

We have not been referred to any similar conflicts between the English and French versions with respect to the meaning of “imprisonment” elsewhere in the <i>Code</i> and the Crown properly concedes that there is no such conflict in s. 732.</p>

That section authorizes a judge to impose a period of probation “in addition to . . . sentencing the offender to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years”. The Crown concedes that a period of probation may be added to a conditional sentence and that this flows from the fact that the imposition of the probation order is authorized by s. 731(1)(<i>b</i>). (This was the basis on which the judge in this case could impose the probationary term to follow the conditional sentences.) It follows that the sentence of imprisonment contemplated by s. 731(1)(<i>b</i>) must include a conditional sentence of imprisonment. Otherwise (and contrary to the Crown’s concession), a sentencing judge would not be authorized to impose a period of probation in addition to a conditional sentence.</p>

Second, where Parliament intended that the words “sentence of imprisonment” and equivalent expressions exclude conditional sentences, it used language placed in a context which makes this clear. Third, there is nothing in the text or context of s. 732(1) which justifies a departure from the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words “sentence of imprisonment” in that section.&nbsp;</p>

line-height:200%">[102]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge in this case imposed a sentence of imprisonment of more than 90 days. As a result of s. 732(1) of the <i>Code</i>, he could not order that a 90-day portion of that sentence be served intermittently. The intermittent sentence was therefore illegal and must be set aside.</p>

line-height:200%">[105]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal, while holding that the sentence was not illegal, concluded that the 90-day intermittent sentence had to be served on consecutive days by virtue of s. 732(3). I respectfully disagree with this conclusion as does my colleague Fish J. Of course, because I would hold that the sentence was illegal, it is not strictly necessary to address this question. However, the point has been fully argued and it will be useful to address it.</p>

line-height:200%">[106]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 732(3) provides that “[w]here a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on a person who is subject to an intermittent sentence in respect of another offence, the unexpired portion of the intermittent sentence shall be served on consecutive days unless the court otherwise orders.” The Court of Appeal held that s. 732(3) applied in this case because, “[a]t the time that the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment [i.e. the conditional sentences] . . . he had already sentenced [Mr. Middleton] to the intermittent sentence . . . .&nbsp;Section 732(3) has the effect of causing the unexpired portion of the intermittent sentence . . . to be served on consecutive days” (para. 21). In other words, the court held that s. 732(3) applied because of the order in which the sentencing judge imposed the sentences. He first imposed the intermittent sentence for one offence, then the conditional sentences for two additional offences. Thus, in the view of the Court of Appeal, when the judge imposed the conditional sentences, Mr. Middleton was at that point already “subject to an intermittent sentence in respect of another offence”. The judge failed to expressly order otherwise and, as a result, s. 732(3) operated to collapse the “unexpired portion” of the intermittent sentence imposed seconds before into a sentence to be served on consecutive days.</p>

line-height:200%">[108]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it gives inconsistent meanings to the words “sentence of imprisonment” within s. 732. The Court of Appeal found the intermittent sentence to be lawful. As discussed earlier, this could only be so if the conditional sentence <i>were not</i> sentences of imprisonment within the meaning of s. 732(1). However, the Court of Appeal also held that s. 732(3) was engaged here. This could only be so if the conditional sentences <i>were</i> sentences of imprisonment within the meaning of s. 732(3). For reasons already mentioned, this sort of inconsistent usage of the same words should not be ascribed to Parliament.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;
line-height:200%">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Court of Appeal’s interpretation makes too much turn on the order in which sentences are imposed. On the court’s interpretation, s. 732(3) would not have been engaged had the judge imposed the sentences in the other order because, in that case, Mr. Middleton would not have been subject to an intermittent sentence when the conditional sentences were imposed. To have the application of the section turn on the many chronological possibilities that may occur in the sentencing process would make its operation arbitrary and impractical. We should be slow to attribute such an intent to Parliament.</p>

line-height:200%">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, this approach to s. 732(3) thwarts the clear intent of the sentencing judge. It could not be clearer that the judge in this case intended the 90-day sentence of imprisonment to be served intermittently. Yet, because he failed to expressly order otherwise, the Court of Appeal held that s. 732(3) thwarted that clear intent. I cannot agree. Without attempting to address all of the variations that could result from the timing and order of sentencing, it seems to me that when a judge lawfully imposes an intermittent sentence and another sentence of imprisonment as part of the same sentencing proceeding, the judge should be understood to have relied on the closing words of s. 732(3) — that is, on the authority to “otherwise orde[r]” — so that the intermittent sentence does not become a sentence to be served on consecutive days. In other words, where a sentencing judge imposes an intermittent sentence and, as part of the same sentencing hearing, imposes another sentence of imprisonment that can legally be combined with it, I would infer that the sentencing judge has “otherwise order[ed]” and that the intermittent sentence is to be served intermittently.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:200%">&nbsp;</p>

line-height:200%">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the sentencing judge tried to craft a sentence that would balance the goals of denunciation, deterrence and protection with his concern that the appellant’s daughter not suffer financial hardship. This manifested a clear intention that the intermittent sentence, imposed first, be served intermittently. Had the intermittent sentence as imposed been legal, the operation of s. 732(3) to collapse the intermittent sentence would have defeated the sentencing judge’s intention to impose what he considered a fit sentence that would allow the appellant to keep his job so as to be able to make support payments. Requiring the sentencing judge to specify that he meant it when, moments before, he imposed an intermittent sentence is, in my respectful view, to take a too formalistic approach to the words “otherwise orders” in s. 732(3).</p>
