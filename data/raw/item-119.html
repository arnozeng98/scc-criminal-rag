He called the police, gave them a description, and advised that they had entered an apartment building. Two young men fitting the description were seen by a constable through an apartment window. The constable stood at the doorway of the apartment and subsequently tried to effect an arrest inside the apartment in relation to an attempted car theft. An altercation occurred giving rise to a charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty contrary to <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec246subsec1" target="_blank">s. 246(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.

Bourque</i> was not a case restricted to situations where a warrant, albeit unendorsed, existed, but rather dealt with the power of the police to arrest without warrant in private premises. The present case falls to be decided by application of <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, just as <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, on the view of the Court at that time, fell within the four corners of the old common law authorities. The policy underlying the cases, both older and more recent, is clear and compelling: there should be no place which gives an offender sanctuary from arrest. Although the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> provides for warrants for the search of <u>things</u>, it does not provide for the search of <u>persons</u>. Absent the power of police to arrest on private premises, a criminal offender might therefore find complete and permanent protection from the law in a private home.</span></p>

While the courts can decline to confer new common law powers intruding on civil libertiesââand this Court has been cautious in conferring those powersââit is quite another thing for the Court to abrogate powers recognized by the courts, particularly when those powers descend from entrenched authorities of the 17th century.</span></p>

This Court held in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> that entry could only be made against the will of a householder if: (1) there were reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought was within the premises, and (2) if proper announcement was made prior to entry. Proper announcement would ordinarily entail the police giving (i) notice of presence, (ii) notice of authority by identifying themselves as police officers, and (iii) notice of purpose by stating lawful reasons for entry. These requirements minimize the invasiveness of arrest in a dwelling and permit the offender to maintain his dignity and privacy by walking to the doorway and surrendering himself.</span></p>

If a police officer is forced to obtain an arrest warrant before entering a residence, he will first have to attempt to obtain the name of the offender from the neighbours. In many cases the neighbours will be unable to supply this information. Even if he obtains the offender's name, the police officer will then have to seek a justice of the peace to execute a warrant. Valuable timeââand probably the offenderââwill be lost. </span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At common law, the better view has been until recently that entry into private dwellings without a warrant was not permitted to effect an arrest apart from hot pursuit and some narrow exceptions to prevent the commission of an offence. Although the police power was extended to include going on private property, other than dwellings, in the exercise of their duty to preserve the peace and to conduct investigations into crimes, no significant change in the common law right of a policeman to enter a home took place until <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>.</span></p>

But these in the context may have been looked upon by the Court as technical omissions. <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> simply gave a restricted power to police officers to enter a person's home when they reasonably believe a person for whom a warrant of arrest has been issued is there. It should not be broadly interpreted so as to authorize entry into a dwelling whenever the police believe on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an offence and that he is in that dwelling. They should obtain a warrant to permit them to do so.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from flagrant abuses, the courts cannot exercise much control over police discretion to arrest. So far as arrests in public places are concerned, the police' job of maintaining the peace and enforcing the criminal law is difficult enough without fearing about being regularly "second guessed" about every mistake of judgment. Apart from the compelling exceptions allowed by the common law, it is not reasonable for a policeman to be permitted to enter a private home without consent unless he has a warrant authorizing him to do so. Invasion of a person's home, in circumstances like these, is too high a price to pay to prevent the possible escape of some criminals, especially for nonâviolent crimes. </span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing arrest without warrant on private premises has serious disadvantages: not only is the owner's security and privacy invaded, violence can result. Again notwithstanding reasonable and probable belief on the part of police that an offence has occurred, no offence may have been committed at all. Since it is essential for police to have the support of the community, it would be unwise to place them in a situation where they are called upon to breach the sanctity of the home in such circumstances. Moreover, the grant of such a vague discretion is more likely to be used against the economically or socially disadvantaged.</span></p>

-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grant of wide, vague and virtually uncontrollable discretion to the police here would create a greater danger to the sanctity of the home than the danger that criminals would otherwise escape. It would amount to giving the police an almost unfettered discretion to break into a home by day or night whenever they seriously suspect an indictable offence has been committed and that the perpetrator is there. It is highly unlikely that a house would become a permanent sanctuary for a criminal because of the want of search warrants for persons, as opposed to things. Parliament, however, can provide for search warrants for people if it thinks this desirable. Finally, good police work can easily overcome resultant problems in most cases. It is doubtful that law enforcement has suffered because the police have not been authorized, the narrow common law exceptions apart, to enter a private home. On the other hand, on the basis of limited experience with entries into homes without warrant, mistakes are inevitable.</span></p>

He called the police on his radio. When the police arrived he gave them descriptions of the youths and advised them that he had seen the youths enter an apartment building. One of the police officers, Constable Handy, went to the front of the apartment building.</span></p>

He entered the building and walked down the stairs to the basement apartment. According to his testimony, the door to the apartment was open. The testimony of Landry and MacLaren (the second youth) differs from that of Constable Handy on this point. Landry testified that the door was closed and the officer knocked on it. Similarly, MacLaren testified that the officer knocked on the door and the door was answered by Landry. It is clear from the testimony of all three parties that Constable Handy stood in the doorway of the apartment and asked Landry if he lived there. Constable Handy testified that Landry replied in an offensive manner. </span></p>

He testified that he told the two youths they were under arrest for investigation of attempted auto theft. MacLaren testified that, initially, Constable Handy said only "you are under arrest" and did not state why until asked by MacLaren. Landry then indicated he did not want to go to the police station and both youths stated they had not done anything. Constable Handy walked into the room and stood quite close to them. When MacLaren took some steps toward the open door, Constable Handy took physical control of him by holding the sleeve of his jacket. Landry repeated several times that he was not going anywhere, so Constable Handy grabbed him with the other hand. An altercation ensued which gave rise to the present charge.</span></p>

Houlden J.A., with Thorson J.A. concurring, found that, though s. 450(1)(<i>a</i>) of the <i>Criminel Code</i> empowers a peace officer to arrest without warrant a person whom he believes, on reasonable and probable grounds, has committed an indictable offence, there are certain spatial limits on this power, imposed by common law and preserved by s. 7 of the <i>Criminel Code</i>. According to the majority, there is no common law authority to render lawful an arrest by a police officer without a warrant on private premises when the officer enters the premises without permission. In the present case, Constable Handy entered the premises without permission or even acquiescence. He was, therefore, not in the execution of his duty. </span></p>

He found that at common law a citizen could deny entry to his home to a peace officer without warrant and use any requisite force in doing so. If Constable Handy was a trespasser, he would have been acting unlawfully at the time of the arrest and, thus, could not be said to be in the execution of his duty. On the facts, however, Jessup J.A. found that Constable Handy was not a trespasser, but that he entered the apartment as a licensee. Though the assault by Landry may have amounted to a retraction of the licence, by the time of the assault the officer was in the execution of his duty.</span></p>

The constables had entered the Vancouver apartment of Mr. Eccles in order to apprehend one Edmund Cheese, for whom there were three outstanding Montreal warrants of arrest. These warrants had not been endorsed in the Province of British Columbia. Furthermore, they were not search warrants and, therefore, they did not provide a right to enter premises. Cheese was not found in the apartment and the trial judge concluded that either he had not been there, or he had successfully escaped just prior to the arrival of the police officers. The trial judge awarded $300 damages and costs. The judgment was reversed by a majority (Robertson and Taggart JJ.A., with Nemetz J.A.

That, then, is the basic principle, as important today as in Biblical times (Deuteronomy 24:10) or in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. But there are occasions when the interest of a private individual in the security of his house must yield to the public interest, when the public at large has an interest in the process to be executed. The criminal is not immune from arrest in his own home nor in the home of one of his friends.

Bourque</i> or <i>Colet</i> that the power of forcible entry is limited to occasions when a warrant has been issued. On the contrary, both the facts and the reasoning in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> demonstrate that the case was not treated as a case of arrest with a warrant. Although there were warrants outstanding for Cheese, the warrants were not endorsed in British Columbia and were therefore of no legal effect in that province. The existence of the warrants was thus relevant for one purpose only: it afforded evidence of the reasonable and probable grounds for the police officer's belief that Cheese had committed an indictable offence. The Court expressly referred to s. 450(1)(<i>a</i>) as the source of authority to arrest Cheese and at no time suggested that s. 450(1)(<i>c</i>) offered any assistance. The existence of the warrants was not perceived by the Court to be relevant to the scope of the common law police power of forcible entry to effect an arrest. </span></p>

Rep. 91 a, 77 E.R. 194. It is plain from the excerpt from <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> at pp. 742â43, quoted above, that the Court was simply reaffirming common law principles of some considerable antiquity. The plain language in <i>Semayneâs Case</i> authorizes the sheriff, in all cases when the King is a party, "to break the party's house ... to arrest him", if the doors be not open. If this authority were restricted by the judges to occasions of arrest with a warrant, one would have expected Lord Coke to have said so in his report of the case. He did not; this lends support to the view that <i>Semayneâs Case</i> conferred a power of forcible entry incidental to arrests in general and not just to arrests with a warrant.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This compelling policy consideration suggests that Parliament took for granted the common law power of forcible entry to effect an arrest as originally articulated in <i>Semayneâs Case</i> and reaffirmed in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>. It is one thing for the courts to decline to confer new common law powers which intrude on civil liberties; it is another thing altogether to abrogate powers which have already been recognized by the courts, particularly when, as in the present case, those powers descend from entrenched authorities of the seventeenth century. This Court has exhibited a cautious approach to the conferral on the police of new common law powers or implied statutory powers, although there has been something less than unanimity amongst the members of the Court on this point: <i>Colet</i>, <i>supra</i>; the <i>Wiretap Reference</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697; <i>Lyons v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633; and <i>Dedman v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2. The present case is markedly different, however, since it falls to be decided by application of <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, just as <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, on the view of the Court at that time, fell within the four corners of the old common law authorities. </span></p>

Crime is often committed adjacent to residential premises. When a police officer witnesses a crime or appears on the scene shortly thereafter, his ability to apprehend the offender should not be capable of being foiled by an offender ducking into a nearby house or apartment building. Our society is more urban, more mobile, and more anonymous than ever before. If a police officer is forced to obtain an arrest warrant before entering a residence, he will have to attempt to obtain the name of the offender from the neighbours. In many cases the offender may have slipped into someone else's dwelling and the neighbours will be unable to supply this information. In other cases the offender may indeed have taken refuge in his own dwelling, but the neighbours may not know him. Even if the police officer is fortunate enough to obtain the offender's name, he will have to seek a justice of the peace to execute an arrest warrant. Valuable timeââand probably the offenderââwill be lost because, when the police officer finally returns with his warrant, the offender will have sought refuge elsewhere.</span></p>

This intrusiveness is carefully delineated and restricted by the requirement of reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises, and the requirements of notice of presence, notice of authority and notice of purpose. These requirements minimize the invasiveness of arrest in a dwelling and permit the offender to maintain his dignity and privacy by walking to the doorway and surrendering himself.</span></p>

Similarly, the risk of increased resistance which is associated with warrantless arrests derives from the power of arrest without a warrant and not from the location of the arrest. The specific concerns relating to arrests within a dwelling are met as fully as they can be, without unduly impinging on effective crime control, by the special requirements imposed on peace officers who must make arrests in a house or apartment. </span></p>

The warrant is a judicial authorization to arrest and contains no express power of trespass. The justice of the peace must be given evidence as to the reasonable and probable grounds for making an arrest, but hears no evidence as to the likelihood or otherwise that the offender can be found at any particular location. There is no good reason, therefore, why the presence or absence of a warrant of arrest should have any bearing on the right to make an arrest in one particular place or another.</span></p>

Following an accident involving the accused, uniformed police officers arrived at his house and were admitted by the accused's son. The accused refused to come down from his bedroom to be interviewed by the officers, and refused to provide a specimen of his breath when the officers went up to his bedroom. The House of Lords found that the officers were trespassers and that, in the absence of express provision in the <i>Road Traffic Act 1972</i>, Parliament did not intend to authorize tortious conduct. Accordingly, though the Act authorized the making of an arrest without a warrant, it did not authorize such an arrest on private premises.</span></p>

The Parliament of the United Kingdom in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Law Act 1967</i> clearly stated that arrest without a warrant could take place on private premises with respect to "arrestable offences".

Section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 creates a category of `arrestable offence' in respect of which the power of arrest without warrant may be exercised.... The proper inference, in my opinion, is that, where Parliament considers it appropriate that a power of arrest without warrant should be reinforced by a power to enter private premises, it is in the habit of saying so specifically, and that the omission of any such specific power is deliberate. It would rarely, if ever, be possible to conclude that the power had been conferred by implication.</span></p>

The inviolable nature of the private dwelling is a basic part of our free society. This concept has long been a bulwark against tyranny of the state be it organized as an absolute monarchy or as a democratic state under a constitutional monarch. Indeed for three hundred years the concept that a person's home is his castle has been the defence of the citizen in an endless variety of challenges brought against him in the name of the state. <i>Semayne</i> has been the shrine of his or her privacy. The concept recognizes an internal security but also an external dependence. The home is not a castle in isolation; it is a castle in a community and draws its support and security of existence from the community. The law has long recognized many compromises and outright intrusions on the literal sense of this concept: for example, the right of the community to search on proper authorization; the right of pursuit; the right of eminent domain; the right of the community in applying zoning restrictions and safety standards; the compulsory participation in community established health facilities including sewer and water systems; and many more. Most of these intrusions carry inspection rights of varying modes and degrees. As Dickson J. (as he then was) put it in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, at p. 743:</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judges in <i>Semayneâs Case</i>, of course, realized that the principle that a man's home is his castle must be subjected to certain limitations to secure the proper administration of justice. Though it was a civil case, it discusses the limitations then recognized by the common law in both civil and criminal matters. That discussion makes clear that an arrest could be made by breaking into a house if the arrestor was armed with a warrant, or again if he was in hot pursuit of an offender. But some have argued that the third proposition in the case goes further. So far as relevant, it reads as follows (5 Co. Rep. 91 b, 77 E.R. 195):</span></p>

In all cases when the King is party, the sheriff (if the doors be not open) may break the party's house, either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K.'s process, if otherwise he cannot enter. But before he breaks it, he ought to signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors....</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some ambiguity in the first sentence of this proposition which has led some to read it as permitting the "breaking" of a party's house even without a warrant. I do not, however, think this interpretation does justice to the latter part of that sentence. It should be remembered that in <i>Semayne's Case</i>, a legal process had been issued. What is more, the sentence we are considering, after mentioning arrest, immediately speaks of <u>other</u> execution of the King's process, the ordinary meaning of which is a writ or other judicial order; see <i>Blackâs Law Dictionary</i> (5th ed. 1979), p. 1085; <i>Jowittâs Dictionary of English Law</i>, vol. 2 (2nd ed. 1977), at pp. 1438â39. These two facts strongly imply that the writer had in mind an arrest pursuant to process, in that situation a warrant. A similar view has recently been expressed by Stevens J., giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in <i>Payton v. New York</i>, 445 U.S. 573 (1980), at p. 593, as follows:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">The context strongly implies, however, that the court was describing the extent of authority in executing the King's writ. This reading is confirmed by the phrase "either to arrest him, or to do <i>other</i> execution of the K.'s process" and by the further point that notice was necessary because the owner may "not know of the <i>process</i>."</span></p>

Plucknett in his <i>A Concise History of the Common Law</i> (5th ed. 1956), at p. 282 tells us that Coke's <i>Reports</i> were not like modern reports containing verbatim accounts of what the judges had said but rather, that along with his <i>Institutes</i>, they were used by Coke to set forth his view of restatement of the law. Plucknett says this at p. 281: </span></p>

-.15pt">That being so, it is useful to examine what Coke has said elsewhere to determine the real meaning of the equivocal statement in the third proposition in <i>Semayne's Case</i>. Now Coke in his <i>Fourth Institute</i> went so far as to say that justices of the peace had no power to issue a warrant that would permit the arrest of a man in his own house until he had been indicted; see Coke, <i>The Fourth Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England</i> (London: 1817), pp. 176â77. If in Coke's view a justice could not issue such a warrant on the basis of real and probable cause, it follows that he would not have countenanced a constable's breaking into a house without a warrant. The majority judges in <i>Payton v. New York</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 594â95, and seemingly the minority too (see p. 611), were of this view.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What speaks even more eloquently is the silence of the law reports on the issue. For over two hundred years after <i>Semayneâs Case</i>, there was not a single reported case holding that a constable may enter a man's house to arrest him without a warrant on the basis of reasonable and probable cause. Given the stout opposition Englishmen have traditionally displayed in the face of even marginal intrusions by state authority, it seems unlikely that the police purported to act on the basis of such power in those years. Stevens J. in <i>Payton v. New York</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 596â98, had this to say on the matter:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="FR-CA" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">The zealous and frequent repetition of the adage that a "man's house is his castle," made it abundantly clear that both in England and in the Colonies "the freedom of one's house" was one of the most vital elements of English liberty. </span></p>

Whereas the rule concerning the validity of an arrest in a public place was supported by cases directly in point and by the unanimous views of the commentators, we have found no direct authority supporting forcible entries into a home to make a routine arrest and the weight of the scholarly opinion is somewhat to the contrary. Indeed, the absence of any 17thâ or 18thâ century English cases directly in point, together with the unequivocal endorsement of the tenet that "a man's home is his castle," strongly suggests that the prevailing practice was not to make such arrests except in hot pursuit or when authorized by a warrant.</span></p>

Three distinct views were expressed. Lord Coke, widely recognized by the American colonists "as the greatest authority of his time on the laws of England," clearly viewed a warrantless entry for the purpose of arrest to be illegal. Burn, Foster, and Hawkins agreed, as did East and Russell, though the latter two qualified their opinions by stating that if an entry to arrest was made without a warrant, the officer was perhaps immune from liability for the trespass if the suspect was actually guilty. Blackstone, Chitty, and Stephen took the opposite view, that entry to arrest without a warrant was legal, though Stephen relied on Blackstone who, along with Chitty, in turn relied exclusively on Hale. But Hale's view was not quite so unequivocally expressed. Further, Hale appears to rely solely on a statement in an early Yearbook, quoted in <i>Burdett</i> v. <i>Abbot</i>, 14 East 1, 155, 104 Eng. Rep. 501, 560 (K. B. 1811):</span></p>

Russell</i> (1829), 5 Bing. 355, 130 E.R. 1098. There the plaintiff sued a constable for false imprisonment. The constable had entered the plaintiff's lodgings and taken her out of bed at night to prison. He had no warrant but was acting on the information given by an informant to the effect that the plaintiff had robbed the informant. Though the principal question appears to have been whether the constable had reasonable cause, Best C.J., who gave the major judgment, certainly made it clear (5 Bing. 365, 130 E.R. 1102) that, "We cannot uphold the notion that a constable is not permitted to go into a house at night to apprehend a person suspected."</span></p>

A constable is in this regard in no better position than any member of the public and is not entitled to enter premises merely because he suspects that something is amiss even though a reasonable householder might not object to his doing so if the entry were bona fide and no damage was caused. A constable may, however, enter premises to prevent a breach of the peace, and probably to prevent the commission of any offence which he believes to be imminent or likely to be committed.</span></p>

In any other circumstances there was no power to enter premises without a warrant, and, even in these four cases where there was power not only to enter but to break in in order to do so, it was an essential precondition that there should have been a demand and refusal by the occupier to allow entry before the doors could be broken.</span></p>

New York</i>, <i>supra</i>, p. 598, <i>n.</i> 46, tells us, no less than twentyâthree states, including New York, had enacted statutes authorizing police entry into dwellings without a warrant. I might note, however, that the New York statutes were recently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in <i>Payton v. New York</i>, <i>supra</i>, which held that under the Constitution of that country entry into a private dwelling for the purpose of arresting a person can only be effected by virtue of a warrant or in exigent circumstances.

The constables were in plain clothes but were armed. <u>The purpose of the entry was to apprehend one Edmund Cheese, also known as Billy Deans, for whom there were three outstanding Montreal warrants.</u> Cheese was not found in the apartment.

Mr. Eccles was successful at trial. Mr. Justice Wootton awarded him $300 damages and costs.

As I read it, then, the manner in which <i>Eccles v.

But these in the context may have been looked upon by the court as technical omissions. It anticipated in a sense the recent recommendation of the Law Reform Commission of Canada that there should be Canadaâwide warrants; see <i>Arrest</i>, Working Paper 41, p. 118, Recommendation 20. There was no question raised in that case that an offence had been committed or that warrants has been issued.

Fugitives from justice are frequently treated differently from other offenders. The most obvious example is arrest on hot pursuit. Reference may also be made to extradition law where, in addition to the relaxation of rules required by statutes regarding the form of evidence, the courts have frequently stated that the technical rules of criminal law should apply only in a limited sense. This approach has been followed in various areas seriously affecting the liberty of the subject, including the more ready refusal to grant bail, among others. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the members of these courts that <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> simply gives a restricted power to police officers to enter a person's home when they reasonably believe a person for whom a warrant of arrest has been issued is there. I do not think it should be broadly interpreted so as to authorize entry into a dwelling whenever the police believe on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an offence and that he is in that dwelling. Several cases decided in this Court underline that the principle that a man's home is his castle remains solidly imbedded in the law; see <i>Colet v. The Queen</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2; <i>Lyons v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, esp. at p. 657; <i>Wiretap Reference</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697, esp. at pp. 707â09. And, as I will attempt to demonstrate, if the broad view of <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> is taken, that principle is fatally weakened.</span></p>

It highlights the importance we attach to the integrity of the home in this country. There police officers were authorized by warrant to seize certain weapons in the possession of Colet who had made it known that he would forcefully resist entry by city employees to "clean up" his property, including the destruction of a rudimentary shelter he called his home. Armed with the warrant, the police attempted to enter his home but they were met with strong resistance, which culminated in Colet's being charged with five counts, including attempted murder and intending to cause bodily harm. Colet was, however, acquitted. The Court, inspired by the principle in <i>Semayne's Case</i>, interpreted the relevant provisions of the <i>Code</i> restrictively to hold that the authorization to seize did not include the right to enter and search Colet's home even though it was obvious from the facts that the firearms sought were known to be there. </span></p>

The situations where it permitted entry by police without the consent of the owner or occupier were all demonstrably compelling. For example, entry to prevent murder is obviously justified. So too is entry on hot pursuit. Apart from the obvious practicality of that approach, in the case of hot pursuit the police officer is himself cognizant of the facts justifying entry; he acts on the basis of personal knowledge. Obviously, too, entry on the basis of a warrant is essential to a properly functioning system of criminal justice. The state must in the end have power to prevent criminals from eluding justice by retreating to a private home.</span></p>

But it fails to consider the advantage of a warrant which interposes a judicial officerââa person not professionally interested in law enforcement and not directly involved in the particular issueââinto the process. The scrutiny exercised by the judicial officer may not be extensive, but the mere fact that a police officer must attempt to persuade a third party that he has a reasonable and probable cause to effect entry into a private dwelling requires some reflection on the necessity of breaching such a fundamental tenet of our society as the sanctity of the home.The warrant also announces in a symbolic way, one traditionally recognized by the public, that it is the state that authorizes entry under law. In <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, a warrant for the fugitive had been issued even though it may not have met the endorsement requirements of the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first say something about the vagueness of the proposed test of "reasonable and probable cause" and the consequential danger of giving the police power to enter into a private dwelling on that basis. The expression, no doubt, comprises something more than mere surmise, but determining with any useful measure of precision what it means beyond that poses rather intractable problems both for the police and the courts. If the principle in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> is to be extended to permit forcible entry into private homes, for the purpose of making arrests simply on the basis that a police officer has reasonable and probable cause, then as the Law Reform Commission put it in its working paper on <i>Arrest</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 115, it would allow him a "wide latitude based on vague, sometimes contradictory statements which provide police with few guidelines, individuals with few definable rights, and courts with little means of control"; see also John Manley's comment on <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> in (1975), 7 <i>Ottawa L. Rev.</i> 649, at p. 656. I have found nothing in the cases or in learned commentaries that gives much assistance in giving more precision to the concept, the situations being so various. Because of the vagueness of the discretion it gives a police officer, that discretion is virtually uncontrollable. Small wonder, then, that the Law Reform Commission recommended the statutory reaffirmation of the traditional position.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall attempt to underline the inherent difficulties of the situation by reference to the facts of this case. The police had no personal knowledge of the alleged crime. They received a phone call from a public transit officer who had seen two youths enter a parked jeep, one of whom the informant alleged was drunk. He later reported he saw them walking through a parking lot, trying to open car doors. He parked his car, called the police on his car radio and then saw the youths enter an apartment building nearby. On arrival, the police found the jeep had backed down a hill and was standing against a retaining wall with the lights on. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of this, how can a court at third hand do anything but hold that there were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the youths may have committed attempted theft? How can one secondâguess the policemen on such matters, for example, as the reliability and credibility of the informant? Informants can be unreliable; indeed as <i>Davis v. Russell</i>, <i>supra</i>, shows, they can be relating false tales for their own purposes.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from flagrant cases, I seriously doubt that the courts can exercise any effective control over the exercise of police discretion in such cases. So far as arrests in public places are concerned, I do not quarrel with the existence of this discretion. The police's job of maintaining the peace and enforcing the criminal law is difficult enough without fearing being regularly "secondâguessed" about every mistake of judgment in such circumstances. But if I agree that a police officer should be able on evidence such as existed here to arrest a suspect in a public place, I do not think it reasonable that he should be permitted to enter a private home without consent unless he has a warrant permitting him to do so. Invasion of a person's home, in circumstances like these, is too high a price to pay to prevent the possible escape of some criminals, especially for nonâviolent crimes like the one alleged in the present case. Not only would such a practice invade the owner's security and privacy; it would often lead to violence as the facts of this case attest. This can, in my view, be even more likely where the owner of the home is not the suspected offender. All the more so if, as happened in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, the police are not in uniform.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger is not lessened by the fact that despite reasonable and probable belief on the part of the police that an offence has been committed, there may not have been any offence committed at all, a matter that may, if his home is broken into, make the homeowner all the more irate. That police intrusion may occur when no offence has in fact been committed is evident from <i>Davis v. Russell</i>, <i>supra</i>. Indeed, in the present case it is far from clear that the accused had committed attempted theft. The account by the two youths under oath that they were walking home from an entertainment establishment and went into the jeep out of curiosity while walking home is not implausible. They were quite close to home. They were seventeen or eighteen, they had been drinking and, they said, they had never seen a jeep like the one in question and wanted to see what it looked like. They denied having attempted to open cars in the parking lot and said they were merely walking between them through the parking lot. It is interesting that they were never charged with the alleged attempted theft for which entry was made into the apartment. </span></p>

The informant had advised the police that the accused had walked into an apartment building nearby, but did not identify the apartment. One of the police, Constable Handy, testified that as he approached the front door of the building, he saw two individuals matching the description of the two youths in a basement apartment. And what was that description? According to the informant, the persons concerned were about eighteen, one was dark and was noticeably drunk (though the police testified that this was not so), one wore a denim jacket and the other a dark one (the police said it was red). I have no doubt from this that the police officer could have reasonable grounds for believing that the youths were the suspects and, as it turned out he was right. But with that description, the chances of a mistake are not inconsiderable.</span></p>

From the vantage of a court, which is supposed to exercise control over police discretion, the identification is extremely vague. The number of youths who could answer that description must be very high. Only those present at the time can really make an assessment. Control by the courts under those circumstances, therefore, becomes very limited.</span></p>

Bourque</i> could be limited to indictable offences. As anyone familiar with the criminal justice system knows, even serious indictable offences can arise out of fact situations that are not really that serious. So far as the crime alleged here, which is nonâviolent, the <i>Code</i> itself (s. 450(2)(<i>a</i>)) attempts to discourage arrest without warrant by enjoining police officers not to do so unless the public interest otherwise requires it. I might also add that a number of crimes can be prosecuted by indictment or on summary conviction at the option of the prosecutor. The choice could be made with a view to making a previous entry into a private dwelling legal.</span></p>

There can be few cases where there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that stolen property is being kept at premises which will not at the same time be capable of supporting a belief that someone on the premises is reasonably and probably believed to be committing the offence of being in possession of stolen property (Code ss. 312 and 313) for which there will be a power of arrest under Cr.

There are several answers to this. To begin with, I doubt if there would be many cases where a person would remain indefinitely in a house, thereby creating a prison of his own making. And if there is need to have search warrants for persons, the answer is simple: Parliament can provide for it as several commentators have suggested; see, for example, Grant, <i>supra</i>, p. 164. Finally, good police work can easily overcome the problems in most cases. In the present case, for example, one of the youths was at home. It would not have required very sophisticated police work to locate the other the next day, and their identification as the persons who committed the alleged attempted theft could not have been more unreliable than it is at present. Such an approach would obviate the temptation that a suspected person and others may have to resist when disturbed at home; the not unlikely violent consequences that can ensue would thus be avoided.</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In truth, though, there is a fallacy in approaching the matter on the basis of a single case. Even if one concedes that some suspects may escape owing to the principle that a man's home is his castle, this has to be weighed against the danger of giving up a wellâknown and long recognized right devised for the protection of individual security and privacy against state power. The wide, vague, and virtually uncontrollable discretion one would be giving police officers creates a greater danger to the sanctity of the home than the danger that criminals would otherwise escape. For my part, I share the skepticism of the Supreme Court of the United States in <i>Payton v. New York</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 602 that law enforcement has suffered because the police have been unable to enter a home to effect arrest apart from the narrow common law exceptions. No evidence to establish this point was forthcoming in the <i>Payton</i> case, although it has long been the practice of the Supreme Court of the United States to consider evidence of this nature. </span></p>

In <i>Davis v. Russell</i>, we saw, no crime had been committed. That may well be so in the present case. Only in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> can we be certain a crime had been committed before entry, but then there was a warrant in that case. We daily permit accused who are almost certainly guilty to go free in the interest of ensuring that no innocent person shall be punished. The procedure argued for would inevitably result in some people who are certainly innocent bearing the burden of a rule which it has yet to be demonstrated would achieve any measurable improvement in law enforcement.</span></p>

We would be giving them a very vague rule for action. In situations like this, they need the clearest possible rules. At present the rule is clear. Absent well recognized and widely supported exceptions, they may not enter private homes. These exceptions apart, their authority ends at the door. That rule protects them and the public from violence.</span></p>

It is essential for the police to have the support of the community. With the type of extension argued for, mistakes are bound to happen and I can imagine few breaches of community values more calculated to incense the public than this one; see in this context W. F. Foster and Joseph E. Magnet, "The Law of Forcible Entry" (1977), 15 <i>Alta. Law Rev</i>. 271, at pp. 290â91.</span></p>

It is unlikely to be used as much against the economically favoured or powerful as against the disadvantaged. It is interesting that the home in <i>Davis v. Russell</i>, <i>supra</i>, was described as lodgings, and those in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> and the present case were apartments. As Professor Paul Weiler has stated, "abuses of police power will rarely affect respectable members of the middle classes", but will instead "focus on the poor and on marginal, minority groups". See Weiler, "The Control of Police Arrest Practices: Reflections of a Tort Lawyer" in Allen M. Linden, ed., <i>Studies in Canadian Tort Law</i>, p. 416, at p. 448; John Manley, case comment on <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 656. </span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I have mentioned earlier that Parliament may, if it wishes, amend the law of search warrants to permit searches for persons as well as things. It might also wish, under wellâdefined circumstances, to extend police powers in respect of dangerous situations and dangerous and elusive criminals (which is not the case here). I would now add some general observations about the respective roles of Parliament and the courts in situations like that in the present case. In my view, if incursions are to be made upon a legal and political value so deeply inbred in our society as the sanctity of the home, it is for Parliament to do so and not for the courts. While the courts must attempt to give reasonable and practical effect to attempts by Parliament to meet the challenge of widespread criminal activity, the duty of the courts has always been to act as a brake against laws that either directly or because of overâzealous enforcement encroach upon the liberty of the subject. It would be an ironic reversal of roles if Parliament was required to act to protect the sanctity of the home from possible excesses flowing from the application of a judicially created rule. Courts undoubtedly have a creative role in developing the law, but they must be extremely wary of widening the possibility of encroaching on our personal liberties; they are the protectors of our rights. Parliament has the primary duty to respond to the challenge of criminal activities. The courts should no doubt view their efforts sympathetically but be forever diligent to prevent undue intrusions on our liberty.</span></p>

But the constitutional environment has now changed. The <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> clearly tells us that certain fundamental rights, including the security of the person, fall within the constitutional protection of the courts. That is, I think, the proper role of the courts. Seemingly minor intrusions on fundamental principles of the type they might have been tempted to make in the past are dangerous. Walter Gellhorn has said it well: </span></p>

For the most part, however, inroads on freedom are not initiated by those who prefer that others assume responsibility for directing their lives; these flabby folk become the hordes that sustain dictatorships, but they themselves are too inert to bring it to pass. We need not worry, in my estimation, that freedom will be brought low upon their initiative. Nor do I think that evilly motivated men will successfully trick us into surrendering one after another bastion in a heedless quest for an unattainably perfect security. The real danger lies among those of us who genuinely desire to protect freedom, and who think that this can best be done by limiting it. They propose to give a little here to protect a lot there. The motive is admirable, but the judgment is unsound. The very amplitude of our American brand of freedom sometimes seduces us into believing that a good deal of it can be spent without anyone's really noticing the differenceââthat we can afford, as Carl Becker put it, "to take liberties with our liberty." But the trouble is that small restrictions accumulate into large restrictions and, in the process, may become as habitual as, before, freedom was. Restrictions justified as necessary safeguards of freedom may in fact safeguard freedom out of existence altogether.</span></p>

I am confident this arrangement can continue to be an adequate balance for four hundred years after <i>Semayne's Case</i> and beyond. If Parliament in its wisdom finds it necessary to adjust the balance, it can do so. It is in a better position to provide for the precise balance and has a far better access to the knowledge required to achieve that balance than the courts. The courts can then perform their duty of scrutinizing Parliament's laws both in their general tenor and in their particular application to safeguard our traditional values. That as I understand it is the role the courts in both Great Britain and the United States, in their different constitutional environments, play; for Great Britain, see <i>Morris v. Beardmore</i>, [1980] 2 All E.R. 753 (H.L.); <i>Finnigan v. Sandiford</i>, [1981] 2 All E.R. 267 (H.L.); for the United States, see <i>Payton v. New York</i>, <i>supra</i>.</span></p>
