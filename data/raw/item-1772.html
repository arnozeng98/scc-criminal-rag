The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811).&nbsp; I am, however, of the view that this appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored, there being no error of law on the part of the trial judge in failing to provide a “clear and sharp” <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in the circumstances of this case.&nbsp; Rather, it is my opinion that the decision not to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was within the discretion of the trial judge and that the exercise of this discretion should not have been interfered with on appeal.&nbsp; I have reached this conclusion for the reasons I set out below.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

(as he then was) held that a trial judge has the discretion, and not the duty, to give a clear and sharp warning to the jury with respect to the testimony of certain “unsavoury” witnesses.&nbsp; Dickson J. followed what he referred to as the “common sense” approach, moving away from “blind and empty formalism” and “ritualistic incantations” (at p. 823):</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">Rather than attempting to pigeon‑hole a witness into a category and then recite a ritualistic incantation, <u>the trial judge might better direct his mind to the facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all the factors which might impair the worth of a particular witness</u>.&nbsp; If, in his judgment, the credit of the witness is such that the jury should be cautioned, then he may instruct accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>If, on the other hand, he believes the witness to be trustworthy, then, regardless of whether the witness is technically an “accomplice” no warning is necessary.</u>&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>

Potvin</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, at p. 557, wherein Wilson J. states:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

The rule was reflected in several decisions of the early 1600s, including that of Coke&nbsp; C.J. in <i>Brown v. Crashaw </i>(1613), 2 Bulstr. 154, 80 E.R. 1028, where it was held that the evidence of a person formerly convicted of a felony was to be rejected in all cases.</p>

H. Wigmore, <i>Evidence in Trials at Common Law </i>(2nd&nbsp; ed. 1923), vol. I, at p. 934):</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">... where a man is convicted of falsehood and other crimes against common principles of honesty and humanity, his oath is of no weight, because he hath not the credit of a witness, ... and he is rather to be intended as a man profligate and abandoned than one under the sentiments and convictions of those principles that teach probity and veracity.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">The rigidity of excluding such evidence resulted almost immediately in exceptions being made (see <i>R. v. Rudd</i> (1775), 1 Cowp. 331, 98 E.R. 1114).</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Bentham, <i>Rationale of Judicial Evidence</i> (1827), vol. 5, at pp. 87‑88).&nbsp; It was obvious that the rule was based not only upon the notion that such witnesses were incapable of telling the truth, but also upon the presumption that juries were incapable of recognizing a lie.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">The judge should first in an objective way determine whether there is a reason to suspect the credibility of the witness according to the traditional means by which such determinations are made.&nbsp; This would include a review of the evidence to determine whether there are factors which have properly led the courts to be wary of accepting a witness’s evidence.&nbsp; Factors might include involvement of criminal activities, a motive to lie by reason of connection to the crime or to the authorities, unexplained delay in coming forward with the story, providing different accounts on other occasions, lies told under oath, and similar considerations.&nbsp; It is not then whether the trial judge personally finds the witness trustworthy but whether there are factors which experience teaches that the witness’s story be approached with caution.&nbsp; Second, the trial judge must assess the importance of the witness to the Crown’s case. If the witness plays a relatively minor role in the proof of guilt it is probably unnecessary to burden the jury with a special caution and then review the confirmatory evidence.&nbsp; However, the more important the witness the greater the duty on the judge to give the caution.&nbsp; At some point, as where the witness plays a central role in the proof of guilt, the warning is mandatory.&nbsp; This, in my view, flows from the duty imposed on the trial judge in criminal cases to review the evidence and relate the evidence to the issues.</p>

The Queen</i>, [ 1965] S.C.R. 739, <i>per</i> Cartwright J. (as he then was), at p. 744; <i>Wildman v. The Queen</i>,&nbsp; [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 328‑29.&nbsp; This test has also been expressed in terms of whether there is any possibility that if the error had not been committed, a judge or properly instructed jury would have acquitted the accused:&nbsp; see <i>Colpitts</i>, <i>per</i> Spence J., at p. 756; <i>R. v.</i> <i>S. (P.L.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, <i>per </i>Sopinka J., at p. 919; <i>R. v. Broyles</i>,<i> </i>[1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at p. 620; <i>R. v. B.

The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, does not stand in the way of taking appropriate action to address that targeted concern.&nbsp; <i>Vetrovec</i> did not deal with jailhouse informants as such, but more generally with the law of corroboration in relation to accomplices.&nbsp; The trial judge in that case had given a very specific warning about the danger of convicting on the basis of uncorroborated evidence from accomplices, and the issue on the appeal was the correctness of the trial judge’s subsequent reference to pieces of evidence that in his view were capable of having a corroborative effect.&nbsp; In that context, Dickson J. protested against “a fixed and invariable rule regarding all accomplices” and “blind and empty formalism” (p. 823).&nbsp; The Court was unanimous in affirming that in this area as in others a label is no substitute for analysis.&nbsp; That having been said, “jailhouse informant” is a term that conveniently captures a number of factors that are highly relevant to the need for caution.&nbsp; These include the facts that the jailhouse informant is already in the power of the state, is looking to better his or her situation in a jailhouse environment where bargaining power is otherwise hard to come by, and will often have a history of criminality.&nbsp; This is not to deny the possibility that a jailhouse can on occasion produce a trustworthy witness.&nbsp; The trigger for caution is not so much the label “jailhouse informant” as it is the extent to which these underlying sources of potential unreliability are present in a particular case.&nbsp; The testimony of Balogh and King exhibited some of the worst characteristics of purveyors of jailhouse confessions.&nbsp; Both were career criminals who had a history of coming forward to offer incriminating testimony in anticipation of personal reward.&nbsp; They tried to ingratiate themselves with the respondent by offering to get “his girlfriend knocked off”.&nbsp; This was a confidence trick to gain his trust and loosen his tongue.&nbsp; In the circumstances, failure of counsel to request a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion, but does not save a charge that, as a matter of law, is inadequate. The jury in this case should have been warned to proceed with caution.</p>

Rosenberg (now Rosenberg J.A.) in “Developments in the Law of Evidence:&nbsp; The 1992-93 Term” (1994), 5 <i>S.C.L.R.</i> (2d) 421, at p. 463:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">While some passages in Dickson J.’s reasons can be argued to focus on the assessment of the credibility of a particular witness made by the trial judge, he also emphasized that the credibility of a particular witness is for the jury not the trial judge to assess.&nbsp; The trial judge’s role is to provide the proper framework within which that credibility can be evaluated, and in that regard problems historically associated with particular types of evidence should not be overlooked.&nbsp; Jailhouse informants presenting a profile such as Balogh and King, generally do, it seems to me, justify an inference of untrustworthiness, and as a general rule in such cases a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning should be given.</p>
