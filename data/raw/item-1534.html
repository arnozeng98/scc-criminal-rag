24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:&nbsp; The decision of a trial judge to allow the Crown to reopen its case at any time prior to a verdict is discretionary, and as a result will generally be accorded deference.&nbsp; That discretion must be exercised judicially, however, and in the interests of justice.&nbsp; The crucial question to be resolved is whether the accused will be prejudiced in his or her defence.&nbsp; The ambit of a trial judge‚Äôs discretion to allow the Crown to reopen its case becomes narrower as the trial proceeds because of the increasing likelihood of prejudice to the accused‚Äôs defence.&nbsp; In the third stage of the trial, where the defence has already begun to answer the Crown‚Äôs case, the discretion is extremely narrow, and is far less likely to be exercised in favour of the Crown.&nbsp; Reopening at this stage should only be permitted in those very exceptional cases that are closely analogous to the two examples given in <i>P.&nbsp;(M.B.)</i>:&nbsp; where the conduct of the defence directly or indirectly contributed to the Crown‚Äôs failure to lead the particular evidence before the close of its case, and where the Crown made an omission or mistake on a non‚Äëcontroversial issue that was purely formal or technical, and had nothing to do with the substance of the case.&nbsp; Beyond these examples, it will be extremely difficult for the Crown to succeed in an application to reopen the case once the accused has begun to answer the Crown‚Äôs case.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="Section4">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">One of the primary concerns that arises from permitting the Crown to reopen during the third phase of the trial is that the right of accused persons not to be conscripted against themselves will be compromised.&nbsp; The Crown must not be allowed to change the case it has presented once the accused has begun to answer the Crown‚Äôs case.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Crown should not be permitted to gain the unfair advantage which will inevitably arise from ‚Äúsplitting its case‚Äù.&nbsp; The fact that the Crown is not at fault in failing to adduce the evidence as part of its case makes no difference to the right of the accused to know the case that must be met before responding.&nbsp; At the third stage of the trial, the opportunity to recall Crown witnesses and to reopen the case for the defence can never completely cure the resulting harm to the defence.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here, it is apparent that the splitting of the Crown‚Äôs case prejudiced the accused in a number of respects.&nbsp; G‚Äôs testimony corroborated R‚Äôs evidence on a number of issues, thereby filling an important gap in the Crown‚Äôs case.&nbsp; In particular, it was the only other evidence that tended to suggest that the accused might have been present in the house while the victim was still alive.&nbsp; Furthermore, the mere fact that the accused felt the need to take the stand again to answer some of these points was inherently prejudicial, since it gave the Crown a second chance to attack her credibility in cross‚Äëexamination.&nbsp; In any event, since G‚Äôs evidence did not fall into the narrow or comparable exceptions identified in <i>P.&nbsp;(M.B.)</i>, prejudice to her defence should be presumed.&nbsp; If any onus rested on her to demonstrate prejudice, she discharged that onus when her counsel argued at trial that he would have conducted the defence differently if G‚Äôs evidence had been received as part of the Crown‚Äôs case.&nbsp; In these circumstances, it was not in the interests of justice to allow the Crown‚Äôs case to be reopened to call G.&nbsp; The only appropriate course of action would have been for the Crown to move for a stay of the proceedings and seek a new trial.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> L‚ÄôHeureux‚ÄëDub√© and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; The decision to receive evidence presented late in the trial through no fault of the Crown is within the trial judge‚Äôs discretion.&nbsp; An appeal court should not interfere with that discretion unless it appears that an injustice has resulted.&nbsp; Since the issue is essentially a factual inquiry into the impact of the late evidence in a particular case, it is impossible to develop rules based on the stage at which the late evidence is tendered.&nbsp; While it may be suggested that the later the new evidence appears, the more difficult it may be to gain its admission, this is a predictive statement, not a rule of law.&nbsp; The accused is obliged to prove prejudice to his or her right to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; The inquiry before the trial judge is founded in the facts and circumstances of the particular case and there is no presumption or automatic inference of prejudice.&nbsp; ‚ÄúPrejudice‚Äù, for the purposes of this inquiry, is used in the legal, procedural sense.&nbsp; The question is not whether the evidence may tend to convict the accused, but whether it is likely to convict him unjustly.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In this case the trial judge made no error in exercising his discretion in favour of receiving the late evidence.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal was correct in concluding that admission of the late evidence did not deprive the accused of a fair trial and did not violate her right to make full answer and defence.&nbsp; While G‚Äôs evidence was significant, it did not change the Crown‚Äôs case, nor did it change the defence case.&nbsp; Any appearance of increased importance that may flow from late evidence can be eliminated by a specific instruction from the trial judge.&nbsp; Moreover, the accused had sufficient time to prepare for the cross‚Äëexamination of G.&nbsp; The fact that she might have cross‚Äëexamined the other witnesses differently does not necessarily mean that she suffered prejudice.&nbsp; The accused was free to recall the other Crown witnesses to question them about matters arising out of the late evidence, and was also free to call new witnesses, which she did.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Sopinka and Major JJ.:&nbsp; It is well established that an accused who has not put his or her character in issue cannot be cross‚Äëexamined with respect to discreditable misconduct which is not charged in the indictment unless the evidence is otherwise relevant to an issue.&nbsp; The rationale for this exclusionary rule is not that the evidence is logically irrelevant but that its probative value is exceeded by its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; The policy is that an accused should be tried on the basis of evidence presented relating to the transaction charged and not on the basis of disposition to commit the crime.&nbsp; This policy applies equally whether the evidence is introduced through Crown witnesses or by cross‚Äëexamination of the accused, and applies notwithstanding that the purpose of the cross‚Äëexamination is limited to attacking the credibility of the accused.&nbsp; The policy also applies to prevent the use of such evidence for the purpose of impugning credibility, since it is highly questionable that as a general rule a logical relationship exists between misconduct and veracity.&nbsp; <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec12" target="_blank">Section 12<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which permits a witness, including an accused, to be cross‚Äëexamined on previous convictions, is a legislated exception to the policy.&nbsp; In view of the strong policy against the use of character evidence to impugn credibility, the policy should not be discarded when evidence of bad character is admitted not because it is shown to be relevant to credibility, but because the evidence is relevant to another issue.&nbsp; If the evidence is admitted to show the falsity of testimony given by the accused, it will be relevant to credibility generally.&nbsp; However, if the only effect of the evidence is that it tends to show a disposition to be untruthful, then there is no reason that the policy against the use of such evidence should not apply.&nbsp; If the evidence is admitted for another purpose, its use should be restricted to that purpose.&nbsp; Here the previous sexual activity with M was admitted as tending to show why he would be subject to the accused‚Äôs direction and control, and the evidence as to stolen property as tending to explain the motive for reprisals against the victim.&nbsp; The use of these pieces of evidence should have been limited to the purposes for which they were admitted.</span></p>

P. (M.B.)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, in which the Crown should be permitted to reopen its case even after the defence has begun to call evidence.&nbsp; She thought that no prejudice to the accused had resulted. If Gabriel had been called as part of the Crown‚Äôs case, it would have been even more necessary for S.G.G. to testify.&nbsp; In any event, the right of the accused not to be conscripted against herself does not include the right not to be contradicted when giving a prior consistent statement.&nbsp; The statement that the accused had told Gabriel about the boys‚Äô participation in the killing was gratuitous, self‚Äëserving and of minimal probative value. Furthermore, S.G.G.‚Äôs right to make full answer and defence was not compromised because she had adequate time to consider the gist of Gabriel‚Äôs evidence and to prepare for cross‚Äëexamination.&nbsp; There was no evidence that additional time to investigate Gabriel would have generated any ‚Äúammunition‚Äù with which defence counsel could attack Gabriel‚Äôs credibility.&nbsp; Nothing prevented defence counsel from calling other witnesses to reply to Gabriel ‚Äë‚Äë for example, the other two boys, J.G. and H.M.&nbsp; In the absence of any legal prejudice to the accused, the trial judge has the discretion to allow the Crown‚Äôs case to be reopened, and Low J. did not exercise this discretion improperly.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 728, may have very slightly expanded the circumstances in which the Crown‚Äôs case can be reopened to include non‚Äëcontroversial evidence which the Crown inadvertently omitted to adduce as part of its case.&nbsp; Lamer C.J. in <i>P. (M.B.)</i> discussed the <i>ex improviso</i> exception within the context of the principle which must govern at this very late stage in the trial, namely that the interests of the accused must be protected.&nbsp; In other words, prejudice to the accused must be avoided.&nbsp; In all cases, the discretion of a trial judge to reopen the Crown‚Äôs case once the accused has begun to answer it is ‚Äúseverely curtailed‚Äù (p.&nbsp;571).</p>

(M.B.)</i>, at p.&nbsp;573, Lamer C.J. gave two examples of the very limited circumstances in which the Crown‚Äôs case might be reopened during the third phase.&nbsp; In the first example, the conduct of the defence directly or indirectly contributed to the Crown‚Äôs failure to lead the particular evidence before the close of its case.&nbsp; In the second example, the Crown made an omission or mistake on a non‚Äëcontroversial issue that was purely formal or technical, and had nothing to do with the substance of the case.</p>

(M.B.)</i> was careful to leave open the possibility that reopening during the third phase of the trial may be permissible in other circumstances, he was equally clear that these circumstances would be rare.&nbsp; In my view, reopening at this stage should only be permitted in those very exceptional cases that are closely analogous to the examples given in <i>P. (M.B.) ‚Äë‚Äë </i>in other words, where the absence of prejudice to the accused is manifestly obvious.&nbsp; Beyond these examples, it will be extremely difficult for the Crown to succeed in an application to reopen the case once the accused has begun to answer the Crown‚Äôs case.</p>

Aalders</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 482, at pp.&nbsp;497‚Äë98.&nbsp; With rebuttal evidence, it is the rules of the adversarial process that justify the admission of the reply evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; In an application to reopen, the Crown is required to establish that the evidence is material to an issue that is properly part of the Crown‚Äôs case. In order to succeed, the Crown must also explain why the evidence was not led earlier and must justify this departure from the normal rules of the adversarial process.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; where the accused puts her character in issue:&nbsp; see, for example, <i>R. v. McNamara (No. 1)</i> (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.),&nbsp; at p.&nbsp;352, leave to appeal granted on other grounds (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 576 (S.C.C.);</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; where the evidence is adduced incidentally to proper cross‚Äëexamination of the accused on her credibility: see, for example, <i>Lucas v. The Queen</i>, [1963] 1 C.C.C. 1 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In my view, the evidence of bad character of the accused in the instant appeal was admissible as relevant to significant issues in the case, and it is therefore unnecessary to consider whether it might also have been properly admitted under the other two exceptions to the exclusionary rule.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">An accused who gives evidence has a dual character.&nbsp; As an accused he is protected by an underlying policy rule against the introduction of evidence by the prosecution tending to show that he is a person of bad character, subject, of course, to the recognized exceptions to that rule.&nbsp; As a witness, however, his credibility is subject to attack.&nbsp; If the position of an accused who gives evidence is assimilated in every respect to that of an ordinary witness he is not protected against cross‚Äëexamination with respect to discreditable conduct and associations.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">In my view the policy rule which protects an accused against an attack upon his character lest it divert the jury from the issue which they are called upon to decide, namely, the guilt or innocence of the accused on the specific charge before the Court, is not wholly subordinated to the rule which permits an accused who elects to give evidence to be cross‚Äëexamined on the issue of his credibility. In this area of the law, as in so many areas, a balance has been struck between competing interests.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">In that case, it was concluded that the accused could not be directly cross‚Äëexamined on his bad character solely to show that he as a person is not likely to tell the truth.</p>

Hogan</i> (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 557 (Ont. C.A.), at p.&nbsp;565, Martin J.A. explained his reasoning in <i>Davison</i> in this manner:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
24.4pt">That case stands for the proposition that, subject to the exceptions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an accused may not be cross‚Äëexamined as to previous bad conduct and disreputable associations for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that by reason of his bad character (disposition) the accused is not testimonially trustworthy.&nbsp; It does not, however, hold that where evidence of the accused‚Äôs bad character is properly before the jury it cannot be used in assessing his credibility.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Martin J.A. wisely concluded that, where evidence of bad character is properly admissible under one of the exceptions ‚Äë‚Äë such as where it is relevant to an issue in the case ‚Äë‚Äë it can be used as a basis for the inference that the accused‚Äôs general credibility is questionable.&nbsp; It may not be conclusive on this point, but it is a factor that the trier of fact can take into account in assessing the reliability of the accused‚Äôs evidence.&nbsp; This approach is eminently sound and reasonable.</p>

(F.F.)</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; In those circumstances, it has been sensibly held that juries can be trusted not to use such evidence for the impermissible purpose of determining guilt on the basis of propensity alone, so long as proper instructions are given in this regard:&nbsp; <i>R. v.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">Read in isolation, this statement might be taken to suggest that there is never a logical connection between the bad character of a witness and the credibility of that witness.&nbsp; It must be remembered, however, that the position advanced in <i>Seaboyer</i>, <i>supra</i>, addressed the highly prejudicial use of evidence of sexual reputation in the context of a sexual assault complaint.&nbsp; There is indeed no logical link between a woman‚Äôs sexual reputation and whether she is a truthful witness.&nbsp; That comment does not stand for the proposition that evidence of bad character cannot in any circumstances be logically probative on the issue of credibility.&nbsp; It does <u>not</u> hold that where evidence of bad character is <u>properly</u> before the jury, it cannot be used in assessing credibility.&nbsp; This is the position taken by Martin J.A. in <i>Hogan</i>, <i>supra</i>, and I agree with his conclusion.</p>

The minority, on the other hand, took the view that there was no prejudice which would offset the value of allowing the erroneous date to be corrected.&nbsp; L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√© J. stated that ‚Äú[m]ere technicalities cannot be allowed to hamper the administration of justice ... particularly where no prejudice of any kind can result to the accused‚Äù (pp. 591-92).&nbsp; In summary,<i> P. (M.B.)</i>, although dealing with a different situation from that at bar, affirmed the discretion of the trial judge to adjust the trial process to deal with late developments.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

Attorney-General for New South Wales</i> ([<i>supra</i>], at p. 65), is that ‚Äúit is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused had been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried.‚Äù</p>

Davison </i>(1974), 6 O.R. (2d) 103 (C.A.), at pp. 123-24, Martin J.A., after reviewing the authorities including several decisions of this Court, concluded as follows:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">In my view the policy rule which protects an accused against an attack upon his character lest it divert the jury from the issue which they are called upon to decide, namely, the guilt or innocence of the accused on the specific charge before the Court, is not wholly subordinated to the rule which permits an accused who elects to give evidence to be cross-examined on the issue of his credibility.&nbsp; In this area of the law, as in so many areas, a balance has been struck between competing interests, which endeavours so far as possible to recognize the purpose of both rules and does not give effect to one to the total exclusion of the other.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">Consequently, limitations are imposed with respect to the cross-examination of an accused which do not apply in the case of an ordinary witness.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt">The modern tendency is to abandon the old notion (a mark of a primitive stage of opinion) that a usually bad man will usually lie and a usually good man will usually tell the truth.&nbsp; It would seem desirable to consider the expediency of restricting the resort to this feeble and petty class of evidence.&nbsp; Another and more advanced generation will possibly persuade itself to this decision. . . .</p>

Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577.&nbsp; For many years, previous sexual misconduct of a complainant was treated as relevant to a complainant‚Äôs credibility.&nbsp; In <i>Seaboyer</i> this ‚Äúmyth‚Äù was totally discredited.&nbsp; At p. 612, McLachlin J. on behalf of the majority stated:</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">It would seem that this principle should apply <i>a fortiori</i> to an accused, especially so in this case in which the accused has not put her character in issue.</p>

D. (L.E.)</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111); (2) cross-examination of an accused on convictions under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec12" target="_blank">s. 12<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> (see <i>Corbett</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 688); and (3) hearsay evidence admissible for a limited purpose (see <i>Boykowych v.

Hogan</i> (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 557 (Ont. C.A.), suggests that once evidence is adduced for any purpose it can be used to impeach credibility if it reflects adversely on the character of the accused, I would not follow it.&nbsp; While I have the greatest respect for the opinion of Martin J.A., the statement relied on by Cory J. contains no explanation as to why the policy against the use of such evidence is displaced because the evidence gets in for another limited purpose.&nbsp; No authority is cited other than <i>Davison</i>, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; Martin J.A. correctly observes that that case does not hold that the evidence that is properly in the record cannot be used in assessing credibility.&nbsp; But it does not state that it can be used for that purpose.&nbsp; Nor was the evidence used for that purpose notwithstanding that it might have been so used since it appears to have been admitted under the exception that permits such evidence to be admitted to show the falsity of evidence given by the accused.</p>
