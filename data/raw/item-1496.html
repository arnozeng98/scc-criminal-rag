François</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 827, and <i>R. v. Lepage</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 654, confirms that silence may not be treated as a piece of inculpatory evidence by the trier of fact.&nbsp; Some reference to the accused’s silence by the trier of fact may not offend these <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> principles.&nbsp; Where in a trial by judge alone the trial judge is convinced of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused’s silence may be referred to as evidence of the absence of an explanation which could raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the potential for confusion, however, trial judges should avoid referring to silence in this respect.&nbsp; Reference to the accused’s silence is also permitted by a judge trying a case alone to indicate that he need not speculate about possible defences that might have been offered by the accused had he or she testified.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">While the principles governing the judge and the jury as trier of fact are identical, it is clear that there are differences between the two in practice.&nbsp; The first difference is found in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en#!fragment/sec4subsec6" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;4(6)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-5-en" target="_blank">Canada Evidence Act<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, which prevents a trial judge from commenting on the silence of the accused.&nbsp; The second practical difference is that while judges give reasons which permit appellate review of the specific basis for a finding of guilt, juries do not give reasons and courts are prohibited from speculating about the reasoning process of a jury in reaching a verdict.&nbsp; While it is impossible to prevent a jury from drawing whatever inference they please from the failure to testify,&nbsp; it remains an error of law for the jury to become convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as the result of the silence of the accused at trial.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; When the Crown presents a case to meet that implicates the accused in a strong and cogent network of inculpatory facts, the trier of fact is entitled to consider the accused’s failure to testify in deciding whether it is in fact satisfied of his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Under the right circumstances, silence can be probative and form the basis for natural, reasonable and fair inferences.&nbsp; Juries and appellate courts are entitled to give weight to the fact of the accused’s silence.&nbsp; As long as the Crown has first made out a case to meet, there are certain situations where the web of inculpation fashioned by the Crown requires the accused to account for unexplained circumstances or face the probative consequences of silence.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:

In other words, once there is a “case to meet” which, if believed, would result in conviction, the accused can no longer remain a passive participant in the prosecutorial process and becomes -- in a broad sense -- compellable.&nbsp; That is, the accused must answer the case against him or her, or face the possibility of conviction.

12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">No adverse inference can be drawn if there is no case to answer.&nbsp; A weak prosecution’s case cannot be strengthened by the failure of the accused to testify.&nbsp; But there seems to come a time, where, in the words of Irving J.A. in <i>R. v. Jenkins</i> (1908), 14 C.C.C. 221 at p. 230, 14 B.C.R. 61 (C.A.), “circumstantial evidence having enveloped a man in a strong and cogent network of inculpatory facts, that man is bound to make some explanation or stand condemned”.&nbsp; That point, it seems to me, can only be the point where the prosecution’s evidence, standing alone, is such that it would support a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Viewed that way, it would be better said that the absence of defence evidence, including the failure of the accused to testify, justifies the conclusion that no foundation for a reasonable doubt could be found on the evidence.&nbsp; <u>It is not so much that the failure to testify justifies an inference of guilt; it is rather that it fails to provide any basis to conclude otherwise</u>.&nbsp; When linked in that fashion to the strength of the Crown’s case, the failure to testify is no different than the failure to call other defence evidence .... If the Crown’s case cries out for an explanation, an accused must be prepared to accept the adverse consequences of his decision to remain silent: <i>R. v. Boss</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523, 68 C.R. (3d) 123 (C.A.), at p. 542 C.C.C., p. 42 (<i>sic</i>) C.R.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the failure to testify cannot be used as simply one of the circumstances from which the guilt of the accused can be inferred: <i>R. v. Armstrong</i> (1989), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 190 ... As Doherty J. pointed out in <i>R. v. Manchev</i>, an unreported judgment of the Ontario High Court, August 23, 1990, the accused’s failure to testify is not an independent piece of evidence to be placed on the evidentiary scale.&nbsp; It is rather a feature of the trial which may assist in deciding what inferences should be drawn from the evidence adduced.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In our view that argument is misconceived.&nbsp; First, the prosecution have to establish a prima facie case before any question of the defendant testifying is raised.&nbsp; Secondly, section 38(3) of the Act of 1994 is in the following terms: “A person shall not ... be convicted of an offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure or refusal as is mentioned in ... section 35(3) ....”&nbsp; Thus the court or jury is prohibited from convicting solely because of an inference drawn from the defendant’s silence.&nbsp; Thirdly, the burden of proving guilt to the required standard remains on the prosecution throughout.&nbsp; The effect of section 35 is that the court or jury may regard the inference from failure to testify as, in effect, a further evidential factor in support of the prosecution case.&nbsp; It cannot be the only factor to justify a conviction and the totality of the evidence must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; </span></p>

The Court of Appeal held that where a <i>prima facie</i> case is established, the judge is entitled to take the accused’s silence into account in determining what weight should be given to the evidence against him. In reaching this conclusion, Richardson J. quoted the following excerpt from <i>Hall v. Dunlop</i>, [1959] N.Z.L.R. 1031 (S.C.), at p. 358 of his reasons:</span></p>

12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">I have never previously come across the suggestion that an accused person has a general privilege of silence which protects him from such inferences as will naturally be drawn from his silence in the face of proved facts which call for explanation on his part.&nbsp; In the face of such facts, an accused person preserves silence at his peril, except where some particular rule of law protects him.&nbsp; In my experience, but subject always to those particular rules, the silence of an accused person has always been regarded as a major indication of guilt in cases where he might be expected to speak if he were innocent.&nbsp; Even where a statute prohibits comment on failure to testify, there is no privilege of silence, as no law has ever purported to prohibit the tribunal of fact, be it jury, Judge or Magistrate, from drawing such inferences as must inevitably be drawn from silence on the part of the accused.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

The King</i>, [1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.); the accused had a right to choose not to confess.&nbsp; The common law right to silence, while it still exists, was to some extent superseded in importance by the establishment of the right to silence in the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The accused’s non-compellability at trial is now constitutionally protected under s. 11(<i>c</i>), but there has also been recognition of a right to silence as a principle of fundamental justice in s. 7.&nbsp; <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, established that there is a right to silence under the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> which is engaged when a person is subject to the coercive power of the state.&nbsp; This occurs upon arrest, charge or detention of the individual.&nbsp; It is at this point that an adversarial relationship is created between the state and the individual.&nbsp; In <i>Hebert</i> itself, it was held that the state could not trick a detained accused into making self-incriminating statements through the use of an undercover police officer eliciting information in the accused’s cell.&nbsp; Once under the coercive power of the state, the accused’s right to silence could only be waived by an informed decision of the accused; state trickery was unacceptable.</span></p>

Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, settled the matter.&nbsp; In that case, in addressing the jury, Crown counsel treated the appellant’s silence on his arrest as evidence of guilt.&nbsp; The trial judge neglected to instruct the jury to ignore the evidence of silence on arrest, despite requests from both Crown and defence counsel to do so.&nbsp; This Court held that such neglect constituted reversible error.&nbsp; Cory J., speaking for a majority of six judges, stated at p. 1316 that:</span></p>

Johnson</i> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 340 (C.A.), at pp. 347-48, is on point:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:78.45pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">No adverse inference can be drawn if there is no case to answer.&nbsp; A weak prosecution’s case cannot be strengthened by the failure of the accused to testify.&nbsp; But there seems to come a time, where, in the words of Irving J.A. in <i>R. v. Jenkins</i> (1908), 14 C.C.C. 221 at p. 230, 14 B.C.R. 61 (C.A.), “circumstantial evidence having enveloped a man in a strong and cogent network of inculpatory facts, that man is bound to make some explanation or stand condemned”.&nbsp; That point, it seems to me, can only be the point where the prosecution’s evidence, standing alone, is such that it would support a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Viewed that way, it would be better said that the absence of defence evidence, including the failure of the accused to testify, justifies the conclusion that no foundation for a reasonable doubt could be found on the evidence.&nbsp; <u>It is not so much that the failure to testify justifies an inference of guilt; it is rather that it fails to provide any basis to conclude otherwise</u>....</span></p>

J. Delisle, in an annotation to <i>R. v. François</i> (1994), 31 C.R. (4th) 203, asked that if an adverse inference is permitted, what inference is relevant if it can only be drawn after guilt beyond a reasonable doubt has been proved?&nbsp; He stated at p. 204:</span></p>

P. (M.B.)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, a case which was pointed to by the appellant as challenging the conclusion that silence may not be placed on the evidentiary scales.&nbsp; In <i>P. (M.B.)</i>, the Court discussed the principles surrounding the power of the Crown to reopen its case after the accused had begun presenting the case for the defence.&nbsp; In a passage which is properly characterized as <i>obiter dicta</i>, given that the case was not about the use of the failure to testify, Lamer C.J. stated at p. 579:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">All of these protections, which emanate from the broad principle against self-incrimination, recognize that it is up to the state, with its greater resources, to investigate and prove its own case, and that the individual should not be conscripted into helping the state fulfil this task.&nbsp; Once, however, the Crown discharges its obligation to present a <i>prima facie</i> case, such that it cannot be non-suited by a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, the accused can legitimately be expected to respond, whether by testifying him or herself or calling other evidence, and failure to do so <u>may</u> serve as the basis for drawing adverse inferences. . . . In other words, once there is a “case to meet” which, if believed, would result in conviction, the accused can no longer remain a passive participant in the prosecutorial process and becomes -- in a broad sense -- compellable.&nbsp; That is, the accused must answer the case against him or her, or face the possibility of conviction.

(M.B.)</i> to the present analysis, I would note first of all that this passage was concerned with a case where the Crown had reopened its case after the defence had started its presentation.&nbsp; Given Lamer C.J.’s decision that such a reopening was reversible error, it is apparent that he included these <i>obiter dicta</i> as a means of illustrating the potential harm to the accused as the result of the Crown reopening its case; the accused may have chosen a strategy, for example, the accused may have chosen not to testify, based on the strength of the Crown’s initial presentation.&nbsp; While Lamer C.J. mentions the legal permissibility of drawing inferences from silence, the passage in general seems more concerned with the shifting of a strategic burden.&nbsp; That is, the accused is in a “broad sense”, by which I infer he means “strategic sense”, compellable once the Crown has proved a case to meet; if the accused does not present a defence, he risks conviction.&nbsp; This observation is not inconsistent with the impermissibility of drawing an adverse inference from silence before a case has been proved.&nbsp; If a case against the accused has been adduced that is capable of supporting an inference of guilt, it may be a wise strategy for the accused to testify in order to refute the case to meet; this does not involve a shift in the legal burden of proof to the accused, but rather involves a shift of a strategic burden.&nbsp; On balance, in my view, the passage in <i>P. (M.B.)</i> set out above is not inconsistent with the conclusion that silence may not be placed on the evidentiary scales, but rather the passage is concerned with the strategic impact of the establishment of a case to meet by the Crown on the decision of the accused to remain silent at trial.&nbsp; The situation is similar to the circumstances to which I referred earlier in which the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In both cases, there is what may be referred to as a strategic burden.&nbsp; In the former case, however, in which the Crown has adduced evidence capable of supporting an inference of guilt, failure to testify exposes the accused to a <u>risk</u> of conviction.&nbsp; In the latter case, in which the Crown has proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt, the strategic burden is more compelling because failure to testify <u>will</u> result in conviction.&nbsp; Reference to silence in either case is simply a comment on the failure to respond to the strategic burden.</span></p>

Johnson</i> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 340.&nbsp; The significance of this case for the present discussion derives from the fact that Arbour J.A.’s reasons at times appear to be consistent with the analysis here -- indeed in <i>Lepage </i>I cited a passage from this case for support for the conclusion that silence cannot be used as a “make-weight” -- while at other times her reasons appear to challenge the present analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; While they are occasionally ambiguous, in my view, as illustrated by my citation of the case in <i>Lepage</i>, on balance the reasons in <i>Johnson</i> support the analysis here.&nbsp; However, as an illustration of the ambiguity in the reasons, I note the following passage at pp. 348-49:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">On the other hand, in the face of proven facts calling out for an explanation, the failure of the accused to testify has evidentiary significance when the accused is in a unique position to provide such an explanation.&nbsp; Failure to testify is not evidence of guilt.&nbsp; It cannot be used to relieve the Crown of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The latter sentences are difficult to reconcile with the former sentence; if silence may have “evidentiary significance”, why may it not be used to prove guilt?&nbsp; However, given the vague meaning of “evidentiary significance” and the plain meaning of the latter sentences, on balance, in my view, the latter sentences are better representatives of the reasoning in <i>Johnson</i>.&nbsp; That is, <i>Johnson</i> indicated that silence could not be used to help establish the guilt of the accused.&nbsp; Thus, <i>Johnson</i> does not contradict the above reasoning.&nbsp; I note that Prowse J.A. of the British Columbia Court of Appeal came to a similar conclusion about <i>Johnson</i> in <i>R. v. Schwartz</i>, [1996] B.C.J. No. 3145, and both McLachlin J. and Major J. cited <i>Johnson</i> as support for their conclusions in <i>François</i>, which conclusions are also consistent with the present analysis.</span></p>

The King</i> (1936), 67 C.C.C. 28 (B.C.C.A.).&nbsp; It is based upon the relative ease with which an alibi defence can be fabricated.&nbsp; As Major J. stated in dissent, but for the Court on this point, in <i>Cleghorn</i> at pp. 188-89:</span></p>

Ratushny, “The Role of the Accused in the Criminal Process”, in W. S. Tarnopolsky and G.-A. Beaudoin, eds., <i>The <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> (1982), 335, at p. 359, cited in <i>Dubois v. The Queen</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at p. 357.&nbsp; At the end of the trial, a second question arises:&nbsp; whether the trier of fact should believe the Crown’s evidence.&nbsp; At this second stage, in deciding what evidence to believe, the judge or jury may consider the failure of the accused to adduce evidence contradicting the Crown’s evidence.&nbsp; This is unavoidable:&nbsp; it is impossible to evaluate evidence without considering whether it has been contradicted or stands alone.&nbsp; Thus, as stated in the High Court of Australia in <i>Weissensteiner v. The Queen</i> (1993), 178 C.L.R. 217, at p. 229, <i>per</i> Mason C.J., and Deane and Dawson JJ., the failure of the accused to give evidence can&nbsp; “bear upon the probative value of the evidence which has been given and which the jury is required to consider”.</span></p>
