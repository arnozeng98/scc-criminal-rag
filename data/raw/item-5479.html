Although there was no direct evidence about who had stabbed Mr. Blackman, the Crown informed the court that it was in evidence that Mr. Blackman was in fact stabbed in the Vaughan Road and Oakwood area in July 2000.&nbsp; Therefore, Crown counsel submitted that the trier of fact would be asked to infer from the evidence at trial about this stabbing incident that Mr. Ellison was referring to Mr. Blackman in his statements to his mother when he spoke of the person he had stabbed and stated that this person had not told on him to the police.</p>

Khelawon</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, 2006 SCC 57,&nbsp; I am not persuaded that the trial judge committed any error.&nbsp; In my respectful view, Simmons J.A. engaged in a re-weighing of the factors considered by the trial judge.&nbsp; In the absence of any error in principle, or a finding that the trial judge’s decision is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, there is no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s weighing of the various factors.</p>

20.85pt;line-height:200%">There is one <i>caveat</i> to what I have said.&nbsp; A trial judge has a residual discretion to exclude evidence where its potential probative value is exceeded by the potential prejudicial effect of that evidence.&nbsp; This discretion extends to what would otherwise be admissible hearsay evidence:&nbsp; <i>R. v. Ferris</i> (1994), 27 C.R. (4th) 141 (Alta. C.A.) at 155-56, aff’d, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 756; <i>R. v. Starr</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 188.&nbsp; There may be cases where the credibility or reliability of the narrator of the out-of-court statement is so deficient that it robs the out-of-court statement of any potential probative value.&nbsp; In such cases, and I think they would be relatively rare, a trial judge could conclude that the narrator’s evidence was so incredible or unreliable as to necessitate the exclusion of the evidence based on the exercise of his or her residual discretion.&nbsp; If the evidence was tendered by the defence, the discretion could be exercised only where the potential prejudice substantially outweighed the potential probative value to the defence of the out-of-court statement: <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i> (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at 391; <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i> (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at 297; <i>R. v. Starr</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 187-88.&nbsp; I need not pursue this analysis as the trial judge did not purport to exclude Ms. Stevenson’s evidence as to Aysar’s statements by the exercise of that residual discretion.
