 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When charging with respect to an offence which requires proof of a specific intent it will always be necessary to explain that, in determining the accusedâs state of mind at the time the offence was committed, jurors may draw the common-sense inference that sane and sober persons intend the natural and probable consequences of their actions.&nbsp; Different considerations will apply, however, where there is evidence that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence.&nbsp; It is common knowledge that a significant degree of intoxication may affect a personâs state of mind and thus the ability to foresee the consequences of actions.&nbsp; It is therefore essential for a trial judge to link the instructions given pertaining to intoxication to those relating to the common sense inference so that the jury is specifically instructed that evidence of intoxication may rebut that inference.&nbsp; A trial judge is obliged to ensure that the jury understands two important conditions:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;the reasonable common sense inference may be drawn only after an assessment of all of the evidence, including the evidence of intoxication; and (2)&nbsp;the inference cannot be applied if the jury is left with a reasonable doubt about the accusedâs intention.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the general preference for a charge dealing only with "intent in fact", this was a case where a twoâstep charge would have been preferable, in view of the primary reliance by the accused on a defence of incapacity to form the requisite intent, as well as the use of âcapacityâ language by the expert witness.&nbsp; Further, while the trial judge was correct to include in his recharge the issue of the accusedâs ability to measure or foresee the consequences of his act, he erred in failing to remind the jury that the ultimate issue for its determination was whether the accused actually intended to cause bodily harm which he knew would be likely to cause death.&nbsp; Greater weight and significance must be attached to this error, as it was made in the course of responding to the juryâs question.&nbsp; Finally, at no time was the critical connection made between the common sense inference and the possible effect upon it of the evidence of intoxication.&nbsp; In responding to the juryâs question requesting clarification on intent, the trial judge again failed to link the inference to the evidence of intoxication.&nbsp; These errors all combine to make the holding of a new trial essential.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Counsel for the appellant argued that this would indicate to the jury that, if they considered that the accused had the <u>ability</u> to foresee the consequences of his actions, he must be taken to have in fact foreseen them and thus to have known that his actions were likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm.&nbsp; I agree with this submission.&nbsp; If this direction were accepted as correct it would mean that the accused could be convicted in circumstances where there exists a reasonable doubt as to the proof of an essential element of that offence; in this case, the requisite intent.&nbsp; While the trial judge was correct to include in his recharge the issue of the appellantâs ability to measure or foresee the consequences of his act, he erred in failing to remind the jury that the ultimate issue for its determination was whether the appellant actually intended to cause bodily harm which he knew would be likely to cause death.</span></p>

S. (W.D.)</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, at p.&nbsp;530, it was held that where a jury asks a question, â[n]o matter how exemplary the original charge may have been, it is essential that the recharge on the issue presented by the question be correct and comprehensiveâ.&nbsp; It was stated (at pp.&nbsp;530â31):</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an error is made, then as a general rule, the correctness of the original charge cannot be used to excuse the subsequent error on the very issue upon which the jury seeks clarification.&nbsp; It would be irrational to conclude that although the trial judge has erred on a recharge on the very point on which the jury had been confused or forgetful, the mistake is of little consequence because some time ago a correct charge was given. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; When the jury submits a question it must be assumed that the jurors have forgotten the original instructions or are in a state of confusion on the issue.&nbsp; Their subsequent deliberations will be based on the answer given to their question.&nbsp; That is why the recharge must be correct and why a faultless original charge cannot as a rule rectify a significant mistake made on the recharge.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">This principle has been adopted by the Court in other decisions.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Naglik</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, Lamer C.J. stated, at p.&nbsp;139, that: âAnswers to questions from the jury are extremely important, and carry influence far exceeding instructions given in the main charge.â&nbsp; Similarly, in <i>R</i>. <i>v. PÃ©tel</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p.&nbsp;15, Lamer C.J. again wrote that where a question is posed by the jury, â[t]he question will generally relate to an important point in the juryâs reasoning, so that any error the judge may make in answering it becomes all the more damagingâ.</span></p>
