24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Lamer C.J. and La Forest, L’Heureux‑Dubé and Gonthier JJ.:&nbsp; As long as an appellate court, when looking at a trial judge’s charge to the jury as a whole, concludes that the jury was left with a sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to the relevant issues, the charge is proper.&nbsp; Here,&nbsp; the trial judge thoroughly canvassed the evidence of the accused’s mental disorder when he discussed the s.&nbsp;16 defence and he was not required to restate this evidence&nbsp; when addressing the “planned and deliberate” issue.&nbsp; By directing the jury to reconsider all of the circumstances and evidence, he fulfilled his obligation to relate the essential evidence of the accused’s mental disorder to that issue.&nbsp; As well, even though the trial judge did not relate the mental disorder evidence to the issue of intention when the issue arose, but only later as part of his instructions regarding manslaughter and attempted murder,&nbsp; his charge read&nbsp; in its entirety made it clear to the jury, prior to its deliberations, that intention could be negatived by the evidence of the accused’s mental disorder.&nbsp; While this aspect of the charge may not have been perfect, it was proper and fair.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The jury was properly instructed on how the mental disorder evidence applied&nbsp; to each live legal issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his charge, the trial judge clearly indicated&nbsp; that the Crown had the burden of proving all the elements of first degree murder, including “planning and deliberation”, beyond a reasonable doubt, and that this was a different burden from that imposed on the accused under the s.&nbsp;16 defence.&nbsp; The jurors also fully understood that even if they concluded that the accused had not adequately established a s.&nbsp;16 defence, the other defences were still open.&nbsp; The trial judge did not tell the jury to disregard the evidence of mental disorder if the s.&nbsp;16 defence was not proven.&nbsp; In fact, he expressly instructed otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further,&nbsp; a trial judge need not instruct a jury on the finer distinctions of the manner in which an accused’s mental incapacity can undermine his capacity to intend as opposed to his capacity to plan and deliberate.&nbsp; It is sufficient if his instructions, when read as a whole, make the jury aware that the evidence of the accused’s mental disorder needs to be considered on each issue, and do not mislead the jury into thinking that a finding of planning and deliberation necessarily follows from a finding of intention.&nbsp; In this case, the jury was properly instructed on the meaning, scope and effect of “planned and deliberate”.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In reviewing jury charges, appellate courts must adopt a functional approach.&nbsp; The purpose of such review is to ensure that juries are properly ‑‑ not perfectly ‑‑ instructed.&nbsp; When a functional approach is applied in the greater context of the accused’s trial, there is added reason to conclude that the jury was properly instructed.&nbsp; First, the “planned and deliberate” issue was not expressly raised by the accused as a live issue at trial,&nbsp; which&nbsp; helps explain why the trial judge’s directions on that issue may have been shorter and less elaborate than on others. Second, the Crown adduced some evidence on the subject of “planning and deliberation”, casting doubt on the accused’s submission that his capacity to plan and deliberate was not on the jury’s mind. Third, the defence’s failure to comment on the alleged misdirection following the jury charge&nbsp; says something about both the overall accuracy of the jury instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection.&nbsp; Finally, this is not a case about misdirection.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Evidence of an accused’s flight from a crime scene or his concealment of a piece of evidence may give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt, and a trial judge should instruct the jury accordingly.&nbsp; But where, as here, the accused has admitted the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence, the trial judge must be more circumspect.&nbsp; Since neither the accused’s presence at the scene of the killing nor his physical responsibility for the shooting was at issue at the trial,&nbsp; the evidence that he hid the murder weapon and may have cleaned it of his fingerprints&nbsp; had no probative value in relation to those aspects of the case.&nbsp; The alleged attempt to hide the weapon and to destroy evidence, however, was relevant circumstantial evidence for the jury to consider in evaluating the accused’s s.&nbsp;16 defence.&nbsp; Evidence of concealment or flight may not speak to a particular level of offence, but it certainly has some bearing on whether the accused was capable of appreciating that what he had done was wrong.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial judge erred, not by instructing the jury to consider consciousness of guilt, because such an inference was clearly relevant, but by saying that the evidence in question was “one piece of evidence that you can make use of in deciding whether the accused is guilty or not guilty or not criminal[ly] responsible by reason of mental disorder”.&nbsp; This language must be said to have been ambiguous enough to have had at least the potential to suggest that the trial judge was making an improper connection between the accused’s alleged concealment of the murder weapon and a particular offence.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; While there is agreement with almost all of the Chief Justice’s reasons and recommendations, his conclusion that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on first degree murder were adequate cannot be accepted.&nbsp; The trial judge’s instructions on&nbsp; the planning and deliberation element of first degree murder&nbsp; did not refer to the evidence pertaining to mental illness and the possible effect it might have on the accused’s ability to plan and deliberate upon the killing of the victim.&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple reference to consider all the evidence was insufficient.&nbsp; Although it was unnecessary for the trial judge to review the evidence as to mental illness again, a specific reference should have been made to it during his explanation of planning and deliberation.&nbsp; Such instructions were an essential element of this charge.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; It is the obligation of a trial judge to relate evidence that is crucial to the defence to the issues.&nbsp; The review of the evidence need not be extensive.&nbsp; A reference back to evidence previously reviewed is sufficient provided it is clear that the jury will be under no misapprehension as to the evidence to which the reference back relates.&nbsp; Moreover, if it would not be apparent to lay persons how particular evidence will assist in resolving an issue, some explanation is required. Here,&nbsp; the trial judge fully explained the relevance and application of the psychiatric evidence to the issue of mental disorder under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec16" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;16<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; He also&nbsp; specifically referred to this evidence in relation to other issues but he did not do so in relation to the charge on planning and deliberation.&nbsp; The jury might well have taken from this that the mental disorder evidence and the psychiatric evidence in particular were only relevant in respect of those issues to which a specific reference was made.&nbsp; Furthermore, a simple reference may not have been adequate in this case since it is uncertain that a jury, without a proper instruction,&nbsp; would know how the psychiatric evidence, couched in terms of s.&nbsp;16, would apply to planning and deliberation.</span></p>

<div class="Section16">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This was not the only instance in which the trial judge simply referred the jury to the mental disorder evidence.&nbsp; He made the same choice when discussing other issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, after spending nearly 15 pages of text relating the evidence of the accused’s mental disorder to the first aspect of the s. 16 defence, he refrained from repeating the evidence all over again in relation to the second aspect of the s. 16 defence.&nbsp; The trial judge said:</p>

Indeed, just as a party would be unlikely to hide a murder weapon or flee a crime scene if he or she was not responsible for the act, a person would be most unlikely to attempt to cover up his or her actions if there was no appreciation of the nature and quality of those actions or no understanding that they were wrong.&nbsp; This sort of evidence clearly does have probative value in a case of this sort.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">56<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge’s “consciousness of guilt” instructions were tempered with caution.&nbsp; The error aside, the charge was fair and balanced and avoided making explicit comment on the propriety of the inferences available to the jury.&nbsp; See <i>R. v. Jenkins</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 30 (C.A.).&nbsp; The trial judge&nbsp; did not presume that the appellant had attempted to hide and destroy evidence, and he did not compel the jury to conclude that this was evidence of consciousness of guilt.&nbsp; Instead, he emphasized that it was for the jury to determine whether the appellant had actually attempted to hide or destroy evidence.&nbsp; He also re-emphasized that whether this amounted to evidence of consciousness of guilt was for them to consider.&nbsp; He cautioned: “Please remember that guilty knowledge is not the only reason someone might try to hide or destroy evidence.&nbsp; For example, someone might try to hide or destroy evidence out of fear or for some reason that has nothing to do with guilty knowledge.”&nbsp; In my opinion, the trial judge’s comments were largely benign and very balanced, instructing the jury to consider the alleged hiding of the murder weapon as merely some evidence to be considered in light of the totality of the evidence in the case.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="1" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">57<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as noted above, as much as the trial judge erred in his “consciousness of guilt” instructions, the alleged attempt to hide the murder weapon and destroy evidence was relevant circumstantial evidence for the jury to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge’s error was not in alluding to “consciousness of guilt”, but in failing to limit its applicability to the s. 16 issue.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, at p. 503:</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I direct your attention to consider all the evidence, including the evidence of the three psychiatrists, particularly where they differed in their opinions, as to whether Mr. Jacquard, at the time of the offence, had the specific intent to commit murder or attempted murder.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">This was not done in relation to the charge on planning and deliberation.&nbsp; The jury might well have taken from this that the mental disorder evidence and the psychiatric evidence in particular were only relevant in respect of those issues to which a specific reference was made.&nbsp; The appellant need only establish “a reasonable possibility that the jury might have been misled” (<i>R. v.

20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">However you should understand that planning something is not the same as doing it intentionally, therefore, a person can mean or intend to kill someone without having planned to kill the person.&nbsp; For example, suppose Jane Smith has a bad temper, she gets in an argument with someone and kills the other person during the argument.&nbsp; Even though she was not intending to kill the other person before the argument started.&nbsp; In this example, Jane Smith might have intended to kill the other person but she did not plan to kill him.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">The word deliberate also means something more than intentional.&nbsp; It means carefully thought out, not hasty or rash.&nbsp; A person commits deliberate murder when he or she thinks about the consequences before committing the murder.&nbsp; In other words, he or she thinks about the advantages and disadvantages of committing the murder.&nbsp; It is an act that is considered rather than impulsive.&nbsp; In considering whether the murder was planned and deliberate you should consider all the evid .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all the circumstances and all the evidence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">On the subject of both the ingredient of intention and whether or not Mr.&nbsp;Jacquard was or was not criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder, I have reviewed the evidence at great length, I can see no reason to repeat what I already said to you.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:12.2pt">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:57.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
20.85pt;line-height:12.2pt">I noted during the trial you paid strict attention to the witnesses.&nbsp; I asked you to consider the facts. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I asked you, considering the facts, you accepted from the evidence and taking into consideration the legal meaning of planned or deliberate as I have explained them to you, did Mr.&nbsp;Jacquard plan to kill Mr. Hurlburt and, if so, did he do it deliberately.&nbsp; I remind you, murder cannot be first degree murder unless it was both planned and deliberate.&nbsp; Again I repeat. I remind you, murder cannot be first degree murder unless it was both planned and deliberate.</p>
