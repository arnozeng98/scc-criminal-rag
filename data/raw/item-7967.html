This, if established, was not information gathering for a lawful purpose. <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec139" target="_blank">Section 139<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> describes a crime that is complete upon proof of an attempt without the necessity of success or actual completion.&nbsp; The offence is framed broadly.&nbsp; The necessary limit is found in the obligation of the Crown to prove the mental element.&nbsp; A directed verdict is not available if there is any admissible evidence, which, if believed, would justify a conviction. In this case, there was evidence against B that, if believed, would establish intent to obstruct justice. To direct a verdict of acquittal was an error of law justifying a new trial.</span></p>

In this case, the question is what would a reasonable person in the position of the police officer understand?&nbsp; The officer testified that he understood well enough that the threat was to his source.&nbsp; The trial judge erred in her legal analysis of what conduct could qualify as a threat for the purpose of the extortion charge.&nbsp; Having erred in her legal analysis, the trial judge’s consequential and dependent finding of B’s lack of the requisite intent cannot stand and the Crown is entitled to a new trial on this count.&nbsp; </span></p>

Brezinski did not testify that Mr. Barros had explicitly requested the charges be dropped; only that he interpreted Mr. Barros to be asking for this.&nbsp; Accordingly, the prosecution had not proven that Mr. Barros threatened Sgt. Brezinski, nor had it negated any reasonable justification or excuse for his actions.&nbsp; The trial judge emphasized that Mr. Barros had not disclosed the identity to defence counsel and had generally made an effort to “make sure that no one would get hurt” in the course of his dealings with the police (A.R., at p. 17).</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC"><span lang="EN-CA">Both the existing informer and the potential informer will regard it as equally dangerous regardless of whether their identity is disclosed by the police, or discovered independently by the accused. In either case, their safety is jeopardized, and the willingness of citizens to come forward with important information is compromised. <i>Leipert </i>sets out a public policy basis for the privilege that depends on secrecy; the whole privilege cannot be swept away by saying an accused has a private right to expose informers. [para. 46] </span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><span lang="EN-CA">Slatter J.A. found that the methods used by Mr. Barros were inherently malevolent and oppressive and inclined to obstruct justice (para. 67).&nbsp; In his view, taking investigative steps to discover the identity of an informer, without more, <i>prima facie </i>amounts to obstruction of justice absent a reasonable justification or excuse (para. 68), of which there was none in this case. </span></p>

Brezinski was about Qureshi’s application for bail on the same date, and that Mr. Barros did not threaten Sgt. Brezinski, were unsupported by the evidence. </span><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;The threatened harm was the possibility of retribution against the informer by Qureshi or members of his group.</span></p>

Beyfus </i>(1890), 25 Q.B.D. 494 (C.A.), at p. 498; <i>R. v. Leipert</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281, at paras. 23-24; and <i>R. v. Basi</i>, 2009 SCC 52, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 389, at para. 43).&nbsp; However, precisely because informer privilege can place a significant limitation on the activities of the defence, it is important not to extend its scope beyond what is necessary to achieve its purpose of protecting informers and encouraging individuals with knowledge of criminal activities to come forward to speak to the authorities.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[29]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In order to assess the ramifications of the extension of informer privilege endorsed by the majority in the Alberta Court of Appeal, it is convenient to set out some of the broad parameters of the relevant law as it presently exists.</span></p>
 <p class="TitleTitre-AltT" style="margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:-22.5pt"><span lang="EN-CA">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Importance of Informer Privilege</i></span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[30]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Police rely heavily on informers.&nbsp; Because of its almost absolute nature, the privilege encourages other potential informers to come forward with some assurance of protection against reprisal.&nbsp; A more flexible rule that would leave disclosure up to the discretion of the individual trial judge would rob informers of that assurance and sap their willingness to cooperate.&nbsp; See <i>Bisaillon v. Keable</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60; <i>R. v. Hunter </i>(1987), 57 C.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Scott</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979; <i>Named Person v. Vancouver Sun</i>, 2007 SCC 43, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 253; <i>Leipert</i>; and<i> Basi</i>.&nbsp; The obligation to protect confidential sources clearly goes beyond a rule of evidence and is not limited to the courtroom.&nbsp; As the trial judge in this case put it, “The police need help, but people who are available to provide information typically won’t give that information to the police unless they are protected” (A.R., at p. 7).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Of course, not everybody who provides information to the police thereby becomes a confidential informant.&nbsp; In a clear case, confidentiality is explicitly sought by the informer and agreed to by the police.&nbsp; As noted in <i>Basi</i>,<i> </i>at para. 36:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:22.5pt"><span lang="EN-CA">The privilege arises where a police officer, in the course of an investigation, guarantees protection and confidentiality to a prospective informer in exchange for useful information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain.</span></p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Bisaillon</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">, however, added that the promise need not be express.&nbsp; It may be implicit in the circumstances:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:18.2pt"><span lang="EN-CA">The rule gives a peace officer the power to promise his informers secrecy <u>expressly or by implication</u>, with a guarantee sanctioned by the law that this promise will be kept even in court, and to receive in exchange for this promise information without which it would be extremely difficult for him to carry out his duties and ensure that the criminal law is obeyed.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p. 105.]</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[32]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">A claim to informer status is always open to challenge by the defence.&nbsp; The Crown is better able to meet that challenge if it can point to clear evidence of informer status being conferred explicitly rather than after-the-fact supposition.&nbsp; Keeping in mind that informer’s privilege was created and is enforced as a matter of public interest rather than contract, it might be argued that in a situation of serious potential danger, the informer privilege (or other public interest privilege) might apply even in the absence of the contract-type elements of offer and acceptance.&nbsp; However, that question does not arise on the facts of this case and I say no more about the issue. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[33]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Unfounded claims to different types of privilege are made from time to time and, as counsel for Mr. Barros points out, there have been cases where the police have claimed informer status in manifestly inappropriate circumstances; see, e.g., <i>R. v. McCormack</i>, 2009 CanLII 76382 (Ont. S.C.J.).&nbsp; It would not, I think, be in the interest of justice to accept the proposition of the majority in the Alberta Court of Appeal that would prevent an accused from ascertaining independently of the state whether facts for such a challenge exist.&nbsp; No protection is afforded to a “source” whose conduct goes beyond the provision of information and acts as an “<i>agent provocateur</i>” or is otherwise a material witness to the crime.&nbsp; Both the <i>agent provocateur </i>and the material witness play an active role in criminal investigations and proceedings that goes beyond “tipping” the police.&nbsp; Once a police informer goes into the “field” and acts as a police agent,<i> </i>the informer privilege is no longer applicable to prevent disclosure of his or her identity in respect of the events in which he or she acted as an agent: <i>R. v. Broyles</i>,<i> </i>[1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 607-9; <i>R. v. Davies</i> (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 299 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 303; <i>R. v. Babes </i>(2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 465 (Ont. C.A.).&nbsp; This does not mean, of course, that the informer loses protection in other cases where he or she has not stepped out of the protected role.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[34]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">This Court in <i>Leipert</i> held that the rule of non-disclosure binds the state unless the accused can establish “a basis <u>on the evidence</u> for concluding that disclosure of the informer’s identity is necessary to demonstrate the innocence of the accused . . . . [M]ere speculation that the information <u>might</u> assist the defence is insufficient” (<i>per</i> McLachlin J., at para. 21 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; This is the “innocence at stake” exception to the general public interest obligation <i>of the state</i> to protect the confidentiality of informer identity.&nbsp; The importance of informer privilege should not be allowed to trump “the right of an individual accused to establish his or her innocence by raising a reasonable doubt as to guilt [which] has always remained paramount” (<i>Scott</i>, at pp. 995-96).</span></p>

National Post</i>, 2010 SCC 16, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 477, or public interest privilege generally, <i>Carey v. Ontario</i>, [1986] 2&nbsp;S.C.R. 637, unless the protection is waived by the informer <i>and</i> the state: <i>Basi</i>, at para. 40; <i>Named Person</i>, at paras. 22-23; <i>Leipert</i>, at paras. 12-15; and <i>Bisaillon</i>, at p. 93.</span></p>

Hirschboltz</i>, 2004 SKQB 17, [2006] 1 W.W.R. 174, and R. W. Hubbard, S. Magotiaux and S. M. Duncan, <i>The Law of Privilege in Canada</i> (loose-leaf), at pp. 2-43 and 2-44.&nbsp; There is no authority for the proposition that the substantive rule of confidentiality means that an accused and his representatives are prohibited from attempting to identify an informant for a lawful purpose and by lawful means.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the perspective of an accused, discovery of the identity of a source, and the circumstances under which his or her information was obtained by the police, may legitimately play a role in making out a full answer and defence. There are occasions mentioned in the cases where the “source” turned out to be non-existent, wholly unreliable, or had participated in an entrapment.&nbsp; In <i>McCormack</i>, for example, it was held that the police had deliberately misrepresented three sources, two of whom they had instructed to act as agents and one of whom was a civilian employee of the police force, as confidential informers simply as an “investigative technique” (paras. 7-21).</span></p>

Brezinski, testified that he understood well enough the agenda being pursued by Mr. Barros — “not specific words, but the situation”&nbsp; (R.R., vol. I, at p. 95).&nbsp; The message had been received and, to Sgt.

Brezinski that he knew “for sure who the source was” (A.R., at p. 16), and noted Sgt. Brezinski’s testimony that “he felt that his back was against the wall” (p. 15).&nbsp; She observed “there is no doubt that Barros knew from his background what kinds of things would probably be going through Brezinski’s mind as the topic of an informant came up” (p. 15).&nbsp; Moreover, she emphasized the statement of Mr. Barros, heavy with portent, that “[w]e don’t want to get anyone hurt here” (p. 17).&nbsp; “[T]he evidence establishes”, she wrote, “that Barros knew as well as anyone, much better than the Court, for example, how dangerous it would be in these circumstances for the identity of an informant to be revealed” (p. 16). </span></p>

Brezinski was to induce Sgt. Brezinski to stop the proceedings against Mr. Qureshi; and (2) the presence of a “threat” within the meaning of s. 346(1.1)(<i>b</i>).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In concluding that Mr. Barros’s acquittal on this count should be set aside, Justice Binnie imputes two errors of law to the trial judge: First, that she failed to consider Mr. Barros’s conduct “in the context of his entire course of behaviour”; second, that she misdirected herself as to whether Mr. Barros’s conduct was capable in law of constituting a threat (para. 58).&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[88]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In my respectful view, the trial judge’s reasons, read as a whole, disclose neither error.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">First, it seems to me apparent from the trial judge’s reasons that she did in fact consider Mr. Barros’s conduct <i>contextually</i>.&nbsp; As the Crown had suggested, she related the evidence to the essential elements of extortion in accordance with the Ontario pattern jury instructions for that offence.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">She expressly directed herself in accordance with those instructions (A.R., at p. 9), noting that she was required, as a jury would be, “to consider the accused’s entire course of conduct” (p. 13).&nbsp; In considering whether Mr. Barros had a reasonable justification or excuse for his conduct, the trial judge explicitly recognized the need to assess “the reasonableness of the conduct of the accused <u>in the circumstances</u>”, as required by the pattern instructions, and stated that she had indeed “reviewed all of the circumstances” (p. 15 (emphasis added)).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">More particularly, in her detailed review of the circumstances and in evaluating Mr. Barros’s conduct contextually, the trial judge specifically adverted to the evidence: (1) that Mr. Barros was a “former senior police officer with seven years active service in the drug investigation area”; (2) that he and his police interlocutor, Sgt. Brezinski, knew one another well; (3) that “there is no doubt that Barros knew from his background what kinds of things would probably be going through Brezinski’s mind as the topic of an informant came up”; (4) that Mr. Barros “invited Brezinski to bring along another police officer as a witness to [their] meeting”; (5) that “there was a good deal of openness as between Barros and Brezinski and Krewenchuk [the other officer]”; and (6) that Sgt. Brezinski “felt that his back was against the wall” (A.R., at pp. 8, 15 and 16). </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[92]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">With the greatest of respect, I am unable in this light to agree with Justice Binnie that the trial judge failed to consider whether Mr. Barros’s actions would have conveyed a threat to “a person of ordinary intelligence <i>in the position of Sgt. Brezinski</i>, taking into account his shared police background” (para. 60 (emphasis in original)).&nbsp; On the contrary, the trial judge <i>referred at least four times</i> to the shared police background of Sgt. Brezinski and Mr. Barros immediately before turning to consider Count 2 and again later while considering that count.&nbsp; She could hardly have excluded from her reasoning what she took care to include in her reasons.&nbsp; </span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[95]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In this regard, my colleague finds that the trial judge adopted an “erroneously narrow view” of what constitutes a threat at law (para. 58).&nbsp; He concludes that the trial judge erred in finding “that the indirect suggestions and veiled references put forward by Mr. Barros did not in the circumstances here ‘qualify’, as a matter of law, as ‘threats’ for the purpose of the extortion offence” (para. 65).&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[96]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">With respect, I am not persuaded that the reasons of the trial judge disclose any error of this sort.&nbsp; Nowhere did the trial judge indicate that, as a matter of law, explicit threats or demands were an essential element of extortion.&nbsp; In fact, she explicitly directed herself to the contrary:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second element of the offence as set out in the Ontario specimen charges is did Barros use <u>threats</u> or violence to induce Brezinski to do something or to get something done.&nbsp; And this is the instruction that I would give to a jury and that <u>I give to myself</u> with respect to that element:</span></p>
 <p class="Citation-AltCCxSpLast" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-85.5pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A threat is a statement of an intention to injure another person or another person’s family or property.&nbsp; <u>It may be spoken or written.&nbsp; It does not have to be stated in any particular form of words.&nbsp; Sometimes, a threat is in general or vague terms without saying exactly what kind of injury is being threatened or precisely who will suffer it.&nbsp; A threat may also be made by suggestion.</u>&nbsp; To be a threat, however, whatever is communicated must be definite enough that a person of ordinary intelligence would understand it as a threat of injury. [Emphasis added; A.R., at pp. 10-11.]</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[97]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Moreover, in denying the motion for a directed verdict on this count, the trial judge concluded that there was some evidence on every element of the offence: <i>R. v. Barros</i>, 2007 ABQB 428, 80 Alta. L.R. (4th) 390, at paras. 29-30.&nbsp; Had she thought, as my colleague suggests, that an explicit threat was required, she could hardly have denied the motion.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[98]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">I thus think it fair to conclude that the trial judge, applying the proper test for a directed verdict, <i>did</i> recognize that Mr. Barros’s conduct could constitute a threat <i>as a matter of law</i>.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the trial, she was simply not satisfied <i>as a</i> <i>matter of fact</i>, that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Barros had threatened to reveal the identity of the informant. </span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 38, “may” support the proposition that not every pressure qualifies as a threat ― a correct statement of the law ― and concluded that it was of limited relevance in the circumstances of this case.&nbsp; Moreover, nowhere in her reasons did the trial judge “conclud[e] that the indirect suggestions and veiled references put forward by Mr. Barros did not in the circumstances here ‘qualify’, as a matter of law, as ‘threats’ for the purpose of the extortion offence” (Binnie J., at para. 65).</span></p>

Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14).&nbsp; In my respectful view, that burden is not discharged by establishing that the judge, applying the law correctly, “could have” decided otherwise (reasons of Justice Cromwell, at paras. 118, 120 and 124). </span></p>

With respect to the second extortion charge (Count 3), I also agree with Binnie J. that the trial judge erred in law in her approach to whether or not Mr. Barros had engaged in conduct which in law constituted a threat.&nbsp; My only disagreement with my colleague is on what flows from this error.&nbsp; In my view, we should allow the appeal and order a new trial on this count rather than reinstate the acquittal entered at trial as Binnie J. proposes.&nbsp; </span></p>

Graveline</i>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14; <i>R. v. Sutton</i>, 2000 SCC 50, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 595, at para. 2. </span></p>

The charge squarely focused on the conduct of Mr. Barros at one or several meetings he had with associates of Mr. Qureshi (hereinafter the “Qureshi Associates”).&nbsp; In a nutshell, the Crown contended that, at one of those meetings, with a view to identifying a confidential police source, he used threats in order to get the Qureshi Associates to provide him with their cellular telephone numbers. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[109]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Mr. Barros admitted in his videotaped statement to the police that he met with the Qureshi Associates and asked if they would give him their phone numbers.&nbsp; Mr. Barros also admitted that these requests were made in furtherance of his investigation into the identity of a confidential police source.&nbsp; He denied, however, having said anything that could have led them to believe that, if they did not provide their phone numbers, they would be suspected and would have to take a polygraph test (R.R., vol. IV, at p. 105).&nbsp; He contended that he clearly indicated to them that they were free to comply with his requests or not.&nbsp; In other words, according to Mr. Barros, “There was no threat” (R.R., vol. III, at p. 182).</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[110]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The only point of disagreement between the Crown and the defence on Count 3 was therefore whether, at those meetings, Mr. Barros tried to obtain the phone numbers of the Qureshi Associates by the use of “threats”, as contemplated by <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec346" target="_blank">s. 346<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a>.&nbsp; The trial judge was of the view that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he did. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[111]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In reaching this decision, the trial judge considered that insofar as the Crown had failed to call certain named and unnamed alleged victims as witnesses at trial, it could not prove that they had been victims of extortion. The only evidence to consider, in her view, was therefore that given by Mr. Kassam (A.R., at p. 19). After having assessed his testimony, the trial judge found that the Crown had failed to prove that he had been a victim of extortion as well. She found that he had not been coerced by Mr. Barros into providing his phone number, given that Mr. Barros was no longer present at the meeting when he arrived (A.R., at p. 20). Furthermore, she found that Mr. Kassam did not know what was going to be done with his phone number when he provided it and that, in any event, there was no evidence that he even knew of the Qureshi Associates’ efforts to determine the identity of the informant (A.R., at pp. 19 and 20). Finally, she found that Mr. Kassam had not been threatened when he met with Mr. Barros on a one-on-one basis. It followed from these findings that Mr. Barros, in the trial judge’s opinion, had to be acquitted on Count 3.&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[112]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">It is true that Mr. Kassam was the only one of the persons named in the count to testify at trial.&nbsp; However, to succeed on this count, the Crown did not have to prove that Mr. Barros had threatened Mr. Kassam. Nor did it have to prove that Mr. Kassam felt threatened by Mr. Barros’s conduct.<b>&nbsp; </b>The trial judge herself recognized this when ruling on the defence motion for a directed verdict on this count:&nbsp; 2007 ABQB 428, 80 Alta. L.R. (4th) 390, at paras. 32-39.&nbsp; Having heard all of the Crown evidence, she found that “there is no evidence whatever that Mr. Barros threatened Mr. Kassam”: para. 37. Notwithstanding that conclusion, the trial judge found that there was some evidence which the trier of fact had to weigh in relation to this count (para. 38).&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[113]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge was correct in her directed verdict ruling that evidence of a threat to Mr. Kassam was not necessary in order for Count 3 to survive a motion for non-suit. Respectfully, however, the trial judge erred insofar as she suggested in her reasons at the end of the trial that Mr. Kassam’s testimony was the only evidence to consider on that count.&nbsp; It was not essential to the Crown’s case that any of the alleged victims of the extortion testify. The Crown’s burden was to present evidence, whether from the alleged victims or not, which satisfied each element of <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec346" target="_blank">s. 346<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.<b>&nbsp; </b></span></p>

Of course, whether the evidence did so is for a trier of fact, not an appellate court, to determine. However, the trial judge’s legal error, coupled with her failure to turn her mind to these elements, had a material bearing on her decision to acquit. That being the case, the correct disposition of the appeal is to direct a new trial, not reinstate the acquittal. I will now explain why, in my view, this is the case. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[115]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In addition to Mr. Kassam’s evidence (which, I acknowledge, was found to be mostly unreliable by the trial judge), the record included the evidence of Sergeants Brezinski and Krewenchuk. Their evidence, in turn, included evidence of statements made to them by Mr. Barros.&nbsp; In addition, Mr. Barros made a lengthy warned statement to the police that was admitted into evidence. </span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[116]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">In assessing this record, it is important to remember that threats do not need to be explicit. Obviously, threats, menaces and other similar conduct will not always be carried out overtly; quite the contrary.&nbsp; For this reason, the evaluation of the actions and the intent of an individual charged with extortion calls for a careful analysis of the totality of the surrounding circumstances.&nbsp; For example, veiled references to possibilities may constitute threats if, viewed objectively, they would “convey to the mind of the person to whom they are addressed consequences which he fears or which he would avoid”: see <i>R. v. McClure </i>(1957), 22 W.W.R. 167 (Man. C.A.), at p. 172.&nbsp; Similarly, the wilful creation by an accused of an oppressive atmosphere which, viewed objectively, would have the effect of giving a targeted individual no choice but to comply with his demand, may also qualify as a “threat” under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec346" target="_blank">s. 346<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>: see, e.g., </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:200%">R. v.

Indeed,<b> </b>the meeting at which Mr. Barros asked the Qureshi Associates to provide their telephone numbers was not a cocktail party held in a relaxing environment.&nbsp; Qureshi had recently been arrested on various drug and weapons charges and the disclosure revealed that the arrests were rendered possible by information given by a source who had knowledge of his illegal dealings. The Qureshi Associates were intent on discovering the identity of the source and this subject was discussed during the meeting.&nbsp; As Mr. Barros put it in his video interview:</span></p>

IV, at p. 124). The trial judge could also have concluded that the purpose of this witch hunt was, to put it plainly, to take out the rat.&nbsp; As the trial judge put it in her reasons, “the role of informers in drug-related cases is particularly important and dangerous. . . . [I]n the context of drug trafficking, it’s not melodramatic to say that ‘dangerous’ can mean death or serious bodily harm” (A.R., at pp. 6-7). The trial judge could have concluded that everyone present at the meeting would have understood this perfectly. Certainly Mr. Barros’s statement to the police makes it clear that he did: </span></p>

While she was entitled to do so, her error of law narrowed the range of conclusions she could have drawn from Mr. Barros’s conduct. Had she not erred in law, she could have concluded that Mr. Barros was well aware that any failure to cooperate with his attempts to uncover the source would immediately place that person under suspicion of being the informer, with all the risks of harm that could entail. She could also have concluded that he acted knowing that the participants in the meeting would hesitate to refuse to provide their cell phone numbers, because refusing could well lead to a risk of serious bodily harm. </span></p>

As noted, the trial judge could have concluded that Mr. Barros requested the Qureshi Associates’ telephone information at the meeting because he knew that anyone who refused to do so ran the risk of being suspected of being the informer and could put his life in danger. She could also have concluded that Mr. Barros’s indication to the Qureshi Associates that he would polygraph those of them who did not want to provide a phone number was calculated to further pressure the Qureshi Associates into providing their telephone information, and give them virtually no choice but to do so. Indeed, while an alternative non-incriminating phone number could be given to shield oneself from suspicion, it was far harder to conceal the truth about one’s informer status in the course of a polygraph test. </span></p>
