 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxic psychosis does not always result from a “mental disorder”.&nbsp; In <i>Stone</i>, Bastarache J. proposed an approach for distinguishing toxic psychoses that result from mental disorders from those that do not.&nbsp; This approach is structured around two analytical tools, namely the internal cause factor and the continuing danger factor, and certain policy considerations. </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The internal cause factor, the first of the analytical tools, involves comparing the accused with a normal person.&nbsp; The comparison between the accused and a normal person will be objective and may be based on the psychiatric evidence.&nbsp; The more the psychiatric evidence suggests that a normal person, that is, a person suffering from no disease of the mind, is susceptible to such a state, the more justified the courts will be in finding that the trigger is external.&nbsp; Such a finding would exclude the condition of the accused from the scope of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>&nbsp; The reverse also holds true. </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the application of the first factor suggests that the drug-taking is an external cause.&nbsp; It seems likely that the reaction of a normal person to taking drugs would indeed be to develop toxic psychosis.&nbsp; This strongly suggests that B was not suffering from a mental disorder at the time he committed the impugned acts.&nbsp; And the rapid appearance of psychotic symptoms generally indicates that B’s delusions can be attributed to an external factor.&nbsp; In addition, the psychotic symptoms B experienced began to diminish shortly after he took the drugs and continued to do so until disappearing completely.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal held that the disappearance of the symptoms showed that the symptoms of toxic psychosis coincided with the duration of B’s intoxication.&nbsp; It could thus say that B suffered from no disease of the mind before committing the crimes and once the effects of his drug-taking had passed.&nbsp; There is no valid reason to depart from this conclusion.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second analytical tool, the continuing danger factor, is directly related to the need to ensure public safety.&nbsp; In this case, there is no evidence indicating that B’s mental condition is inherently dangerous in any way.&nbsp; Provided that B abstains from such drugs in the future, which he is capable of doing voluntarily, it would seem that his mental condition poses no threat to public safety. </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this context, B was not suffering from a “mental disorder” for the purposes of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> at the time he committed the assault.&nbsp; A malfunctioning of the mind that results exclusively from self‑induced intoxication cannot be considered a disease of the mind in the legal sense, since it is not a product of the individual’s inherent psychological makeup.&nbsp; This is true even though medical science may tend to consider such conditions to be diseases of the mind. </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The foregoing conclusion leads to the question whether s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> is applicable.&nbsp; This provision applies where three&nbsp;conditions are met:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;the accused was intoxicated at the material time; (2)&nbsp;the intoxication was self‑induced; and (3)&nbsp;the accused departed from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society by interfering or threatening to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.&nbsp; Where these three things are proved, it is not a defence that the accused lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence.&nbsp; Section&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> therefore applies to any mental condition that is a direct extension of a state of intoxication.&nbsp; There is no threshold of intoxication beyond which s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> does not apply to an accused, which means that toxic psychosis can be one of the states of intoxication covered by this provision.&nbsp; It is so covered in the case at bar.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal therefore did not err in law in holding that s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> was applicable rather than s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i></span></p>

(3d) 548).&nbsp; With leave of this Court, the appellant is now appealing the judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal, which rejected the argument that a toxic psychosis resulting from the voluntary consumption of drugs is a “mental disorder” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> </span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Nevertheless, the appellant’s position leads to the same result.&nbsp; It amounts in substance to arguing that a single episode of intoxication can be a “mental disorder” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.

C.</i> (A.F., at para.&nbsp;48).&nbsp; The appellant’s reasoning therefore rests on the premise that intoxication can never be the real or underlying cause of toxic psychosis and that toxic psychosis must originate in a pre‑existing mental condition.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[28]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The appellant adds that the passage in question is incorrect in law because Parliament, in enacting s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>, endorsed the position taken by the dissenting judges in <i>Daviault</i> that, owing to policy considerations, the defence of self‑induced intoxication should not be available in the case of a general intent offence.&nbsp; He points out that those dissenting judges had acknowledged that [<span style="text-transform:

Beard</i>, [1920] A.C. 479, in which Lord&nbsp;Birkenhead set out the following three rules&nbsp;(as summarized by Bastarache&nbsp;J. in <i>R. v.

Robinson</i>, [1996] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 683 (<i>Daley</i>, at para.&nbsp;40).&nbsp; In <i>Robinson</i>, this Court held that the third of the rules from <i>Beard</i>, which was based on the <i>capacity</i> of the accused to form a specific intent, violated <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec7" target="_blank">ss.&nbsp;7<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> and <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">11(<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a><i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">d<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11" target="_blank">)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>, because it required a jury to convict even if there was a reasonable doubt that the accused possessed <i>actual intent</i>.&nbsp; The Court therefore replaced this rule with one to the effect that intoxication can be a defence if it prevented the accused from forming the actual specific intent to commit the offence.</span></p>

The Queen</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29, this Court answered this question in the negative.&nbsp; In that case, the Court established the principle that the recklessness shown by an accused in becoming voluntarily intoxicated can constitute the fault element needed to find that a general intent offence has been committed (<i>Daley</i>, at para.&nbsp;36; see also the reasons of McIntyre&nbsp;J. in <i>R. v.

C.</i>&nbsp; However, the enactment of that provision did not revive the <i>Leary</i> rule.&nbsp; It did not actually codify the position taken by the dissenting judges in <i>Daviault</i>; rather, it limited the scope of the rule stated by the majority.&nbsp; This means that the principles set out in <i>Daviault</i> still represent the state of the law in Canada, subject, of course, to the significant restriction set out in s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr. C.</i>&nbsp; <i>Daviault</i> would still apply today, for example, to enable an accused charged with a property offence to plead extreme intoxication.&nbsp; Indeed, the fact that the appellant was acquitted at trial on the charges against him under ss.&nbsp;348(1)(<i>a</i>) and 463 <i>Cr.

C.</i> should not be interpreted so as to limit the scope of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr. C.</i>&nbsp; Intoxication and insanity are two distinct legal concepts.&nbsp; As defences to criminal charges, they have different logics and each of them is governed by its own principles. </span></p>

C.</i> are mutually exclusive.&nbsp; For s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr. C.</i> to apply, the court must reach a conclusion in law that the accused lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence <i>by reason of self‑induced intoxication</i>.&nbsp; The absence of this intent or voluntariness would then preclude a finding that the incapacity of the accused was caused by a disease of the mind (<i>R. v. Huppie</i>, 2008 ABQB 539 (CanLII), at para.&nbsp;21).&nbsp; Conversely, the fact that an accused was intoxicated at the material time cannot support a finding that s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr. C.</i> applies if the accused establishes that he or she was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his or her acts <i>by reason of a mental disorder</i>. </span></p>

C.</i>&nbsp; This appears to be all the more difficult to do in cases in which the mental health of the accused was already precarious prior to the incident in question, even if his or her problems had not yet been diagnosed at the time, and in which the psychosis emerged while the accused was highly intoxicated.&nbsp; Yet this identification of the source of the psychosis plays a key role, since it will ultimately determine whether the accused will be held criminally responsible for his or her actions.</span></p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, one might say that in a legal sense “disease of the mind” embraces any illness, disorder or abnormal condition which impairs the human mind and its functioning, <u>excluding however, self‑induced states caused by alcohol or drugs</u>, as well as transitory mental states such as hysteria or concussion.&nbsp; [Emphasis added; p.&nbsp;1159.]</span></p>

C.</i>, and the states of intoxication now covered by s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>&nbsp; However, where an accused raises a defence of mental disorder, it important that the legal analysis of the situation follow a logical order.&nbsp; The court must not begin its analysis by considering whether the mental condition of the accused at the material time is covered by s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>&nbsp; Such an approach would reverse the steps of the appropriate analytical process and disregard the nature of the defence raised by the accused.&nbsp; And as a result of it, the legal characterization exercise required by s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> would depend on the interpretation of the concept of causation in issue in s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>&nbsp; The court must instead consider the specific principles that govern the insanity defence in order to determine whether s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> is applicable.&nbsp; If that defence does not apply, the court can then consider whether s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr. C.</i> is applicable if it is appropriate to do so on the facts of the case.</span></p>

C.</i> limits the scope of the defence of mental disorder provided for in s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>&nbsp; She stated clearly that no overlap is possible in the application of these provisions and simply concluded that, as the law stands in Canada, [<span style="text-transform:uppercase">translation</span>] “an accused suffering from a psychosis caused by the consumption of drugs in circumstances analogous to the ones in the case before us” cannot be found to have a disease of the mind for the purposes of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> (para.&nbsp;77).&nbsp; After noting that the appellant had to be considered from a legal standpoint to have been <i>intoxicated</i> at the material time, Thibault&nbsp;J.A. added that the appellant’s argument was an indirect way to avoid the application of s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> </span></p>

Chaulk</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, at p.&nbsp;1397).&nbsp; In <i>Ruzic</i>, the Court recognized the existence of a principle of fundamental justice that “only voluntary conduct — behaviour that is the product of a free will and controlled body, unhindered by external constraints — should attract the penalty and stigma of criminal liability” (para.&nbsp;47).</span></p>

Oakley </i>(1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 351 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Mailloux </i>(1985), 25&nbsp;C.C.C. (3d) 171 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1029; <i>R. v.

Malcolm </i>(1989), 50&nbsp;C.C.C. (3d) 172 (Man. C.A.)).&nbsp; It seems that this diversity of circumstances can be attributed to variations in psychological makeup and psychological histories from one accused to another, as well as in the nature of the drug use that contributed to their psychoses.&nbsp; The quantity and toxicity of the drugs taken also seem to have a significant effect in this regard.&nbsp; As a result, in each new situation, the case turns on its own facts and cannot always be fitted easily into the existing case law.</span></p>

The comparison between the circumstances of the accused and those of a normal person will be objective and may be based on the psychiatric evidence.&nbsp; The more the psychiatric evidence suggests that a normal person, that is, a person suffering from no disease of the mind, is susceptible to such a state, the more justified the courts will be in finding that the trigger is external.&nbsp; Such a finding would exclude the condition of the accused from the scope of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i>&nbsp; The reverse also holds true.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[72]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Although the trigger associated with the internal cause factor often involves a “psychological blow”, there is no reason why it cannot consist of alcohol or drug use contemporaneous with the offence.&nbsp; What must therefore be determined is what state a normal person might have entered after consuming the same substances in the same quantities as the accused.&nbsp; Since certain factors such as fatigue and the pace of consumption may influence the effects of drugs, this comparison must take account of all the circumstances in which the accused consumed the drugs that triggered the psychotic condition.&nbsp; If a normal person might also have reacted to similar drug use by developing toxic psychosis, it will be easier for the court to find that the mental disorder of the accused was purely external in origin (<i>Rabey</i> (S.C.C.), at pp.&nbsp;519 and 533; see also <i>Moroz</i>, at para.&nbsp;46) and was not a disease of the mind within the meaning of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[74]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Although Bastarache&nbsp;J.’s reasons were not explicit in this regard, it stands to reason that danger will be recurring only if it is likely to arise again independently of the exercise of the will of the accused.&nbsp; The recurrence of danger is not a factor linked to voluntary behaviour by the accused.&nbsp; This conclusion is consistent with the idea that the effect of the defence provided for in s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> is to exempt from criminal responsibility an accused whose actions are morally involuntary.&nbsp; The purpose of the defence of mental disorder is to ascertain whether the mental condition of the accused poses an <i>inherent</i> danger, that is, a danger that persists despite the will of the accused.&nbsp; As a corollary to this principle, a danger to public safety that might be voluntarily <i>created</i> by the accused in the future by consuming drugs would not be the result of a “mental disorder” for the purposes of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i></span></p>

uppercase">translation</span>] “the psychotic condition the accused was in when he committed these criminal acts originated in his drug use during the moments leading up to them” (para.&nbsp;41).&nbsp; I would also note that the appellant’s central argument is based on the contention that toxic psychosis is necessarily a “mental disorder” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> because it is an “abnormal effect” of intoxication that affects only those who have a psychological predisposition or whose psyches are particularly fragile.</span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[89]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The foregoing conclusion leads to the question whether s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> is applicable.&nbsp; This provision applies where three&nbsp;conditions are met:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;the accused was intoxicated at the material time; (2) the intoxication was self‑induced; and (3)&nbsp;the accused departed from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society by interfering or threatening to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person (see, generally, <i>R. v. Vickberg</i> (1998), 16 C.R. (5th) 164 (B.C.S.C.); <i>R. v. Chaulk</i>, 2007 NSCA 84, 257 N.S.R. (2d) 99).&nbsp; Where these three things are proved, it is not a defence that the accused lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[90]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">The self‑induced intoxication to which s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> refers is limited in time.&nbsp; It corresponds to the period during which the substance consumed by the accused produced its effects.&nbsp; Section&nbsp;33.1(2) <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> leaves no doubt about this.&nbsp; It provides that a person “is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. criminally at fault where the person, <u>while in a state of self‑induced intoxication that renders the person</u> unaware of, or <u>incapable</u> of consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person”.&nbsp; Section&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> is intended to prevent an accused from avoiding criminal liability on the ground that his or her state of intoxication at the material time <i>rendered the accused incapable</i> of forming the mental element or having the voluntariness required to commit the offence.</span></p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm"><span lang="EN-CA">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">Section&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> therefore applies to any mental condition that is a direct extension of a state of intoxication.&nbsp; It is also important to understand that no distinction based on the seriousness of the effects of self‑induced intoxication is drawn in this provision.&nbsp; The appellant’s suggestion that it applies only to the “normal effects” of intoxication is wrong.&nbsp; There is no threshold of intoxication beyond which s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> does not apply to an accused, which means that toxic psychosis can be one of the states of intoxication covered by this provision.&nbsp; It is so covered in the case at bar.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal therefore did not err in law in holding that s.&nbsp;33.1 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i> was applicable rather than s. 16 <i>Cr.&nbsp;C.</i></span></p>
