She had married Mayuran Thangarajah (Mayuran) in an arranged marriage earlier that year.&nbsp; When she arrived in Canada, she moved into an apartment in Montréal with her husband, his father, his mother, his younger sister, his brother Manchutan and Manchutan’s wife Dayani.</p>

Only Suganthini’s DNA was found on the handle.&nbsp; Dr. Lauzon also said that the cuts Suganthini received on her hand were consistent with an injury that could have been caused by stabbing someone.</p>

Did you know that the baby in her womb is - - the father of the child is Mayuran [Suganthini’s husband].”</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[12]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suganthini said that she tried to “snatch” the knife from him, which resulted in a cut to her hand.&nbsp; Manchutan pushed her out of the room, at which point she locked herself inside her mother-in-law’s bedroom.&nbsp; She said that Manchutan later yelled at her through the door, telling her never to disclose the day’s events, and to tell anyone who asked that a robber had broken into the house.&nbsp; After an indeterminate period, Suganthini left the bedroom, saw Dayani bleeding on the floor of her own bedroom and called her father-in-law.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[13]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suganthini denied having confessed to the murder in the prison telephone calls.&nbsp; She said that she had tried to tell her mother-in-law the truth about the argument she saw between Dayani and her husband, but her mother-in-law had hung up the phone.&nbsp; Her evidence about the bloody clothing was that she put it into the bucket because it had been soiled during menstruation overnight.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[16]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal also identified four other errors in the jury instruction, but applied the curative proviso because these errors “could have had [no] impact on the verdict in light of the evidence”.</p>

Cinous</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 50).&nbsp; The air of reality test imposes two duties on the trial judge: to “put to the jury all defences that arise on the facts, whether or not they have been specifically raised by an accused”; and “to keep from the jury defences lacking an evidential foundation” (<i>Cinous</i>, at para. 51).&nbsp; Whether a defence arises on the evidence of the accused or of the Crown, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury if it has an air of reality (<i>Cinous</i>, at para. 53; <i>R. v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining whether a defence has an air of reality, there must be an examination into the sufficiency of the evidence.&nbsp; It is not enough for there to be “some evidence” supporting the defence (<i>Cinous</i>, at para. 83).&nbsp; The test is “whether there is (1) evidence (2) upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence to be true” (<i>Cinous</i>, at para. 65).&nbsp; For defences that rely on indirect evidence or defences like provocation that include an objective reasonableness component, the trial judge must examine the “field of factual inferences” that can reasonably be drawn from the evidence (<i>Cinous</i>,<i> </i>at para. 91).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship between the air of reality and the defence of provocation was recently considered by this Court in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Tran</i>, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, where Charron J. explained that</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [f]or the defence to succeed, the jury must have a reasonable doubt about whether each of the elements of provocation was present. This necessarily requires that there be a sufficient evidential basis in respect of each component of the defence before it is left to the jury: the evidence must be reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the defence before there is an air of reality to the defence . . . . [para. 41]</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[23]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two elements to the defence of provocation: an objective and a subjective one.&nbsp; The two components were described in <i>R. v. Thibert</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there must be a wrongful act or insult of such a nature that it is sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control as the objective element. Second, the subjective element requires that the accused act upon that insult on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool. [Emphasis deleted; para. 4.]</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC">(See also <i>Tran</i>, at para. 23.)</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">The objective element of the defence requires that “(1) there must be a wrongful act or insult; and (2) the wrongful act or insult must be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control” (<i>Tran</i>, at para. 25).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[24]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order for the defence of provocation to have an air of reality in this case, the evidence must be capable of giving rise to a reasonable doubt that an ordinary person in Suganthini’s circumstances would be deprived of the power of self-control when hearing insults about his or her level of education.&nbsp; In my respectful opinion, that conclusion is simply untenable.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[25]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority in the Court of Appeal found that the defence of provocation had an air of reality based on the alleged prison conversation in which Suganthini confessed that she killed Dayani because she had made fun of her.&nbsp; The fact that there were 45 stab wounds, the court concluded, supported the inference that the murder had “occurred in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation”.&nbsp; But, the majority did not in any way address whether the objective element of the defence was met.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[26]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court has repeatedly reinforced the importance of the objective element.&nbsp; As Dickson C.J. said in <i>R. v. Hill</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 313, “We seek to encourage conduct that complies with certain societal standards of reasonableness and responsibility. In doing this, the law quite logically employs the objective standard of the reasonable person” (pp. 324-25), whom he defined as someone having “a normal temperament and level of self-control”, and as not being “exceptionally excitable, pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness” (p. 331).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[27]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dickson C.J. acknowledged that “particular characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an ordinary person without subverting the logic of the objective test of provocation”, including features “such as sex, age, or race” (<i>Hill</i>, at p. 331; see also <i>Thibert</i>, at para. 14).&nbsp; But he emphasized that these characteristics are only relevant to the extent that they help determine how an <i>ordinary</i> person would react in the circumstances.&nbsp; As Charron J. warned in <i>Tran</i>:</p>

The Queen</i>, [1965] S.C.R. 739, at p. 752; see also <i>R. v. White</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.), at pp. 607-8, aff’d [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72).&nbsp; The Crown’s case, however, was grounded in Suganthini’s exclusive opportunity to commit the offence, not motive.&nbsp; While it would have been preferable if the trial judge had reminded the jury about Suganthini’s evidence, the failure to do so in this case was relatively minor given the marginal role of motive in the Crown’s case.</p>

The judge also has the duty, insofar as it is necessary, to assist the jury by reviewing the evidence as it relates to the issues in the case. <i>The judge is also entitled to give an opinion on a question of fact and express it as strongly as the circumstances permit, so long as it is made clear to the jury that the opinion is given as advice and not direction</i>.</span></p>

It does not matter how obvious the judge may believe the answer to be. Nor does it matter that the judge may be of the view that any other conclusion would be perverse. <i>The trial judge may give an opinion on the matter when it is warranted, but never a direction</i>.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[38]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeal also said that the trial judge erred because since this case was essentially based on circumstantial evidence, a specific instruction was required, telling the jury that it could only convict if it was satisfied that the <i>only</i>&nbsp; “reasonable inference” to be drawn from that evidence was that Suganthini was guilty.&nbsp; However this Court explained in <i>R. v. Griffin</i>, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, that “[w]e have long departed from any legal requirement for a ‘special instruction’ on circumstantial evidence”.&nbsp; What is important is that in cases that rely entirely on circumstantial evidence, the jury is made aware of how they can use that evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The trial judge in this case explained to the jury the nature of circumstantial evidence, the inferences that can properly be drawn from that evidence, and the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In my view, the instruction satisfied the test in <i>Griffin </i>(see also <i>R. v. Fleet</i> (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 20, cited in <i>Griffin</i>, at para. 33).</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you decide that the accused made a statement that may help her in her defence or if you cannot decide whether she made it, <i>you will consider that statement along with the rest of the evidence in deciding whether you have a reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt</i>.</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may give anything you find the accused said as much or as little importance as you think it deserves in deciding this case.

MacKenzie</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 212.&nbsp; As a general rule, the evidence in a case should be considered as a whole in determining whether there is a reasonable doubt as to guilt (<i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345; <i>R. v. Rojas</i>, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 111, at para. 43).&nbsp; But <i>MacKenzie </i>held that, “on important items of evidence the jury may require guidance on how to approach its task”.&nbsp; As a result,</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . where a statement by an accused at trial is entirely at odds with a previous out-of-court statement by the accused, and the jury believes the statement at trial, or is left in reasonable doubt that it is true, then the jury must reject the out-of-court statement; the accused must be given the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; In arriving at that conclusion, the jury should, of course, give consideration to the evidence as a whole. [p. 239]</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[47]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most of the errors were minor and could not possibly have affected the verdict.&nbsp; The <i>MacKenzie</i> error was more serious, but I am satisfied that it was not fatal because the Crown’s case against Suganthini was overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown advanced a narrative that was largely based on the testimony of the Thangarajah family, which placed Suganthini alone in the apartment with Dayani at the critical moment, a version that was corroborated by testimony and physical evidence.&nbsp; Suganthini admitted to being in the apartment, but advanced a wholly contradictory version of the day’s events, which positioned her as the only witness to Dayani’s murder by&nbsp; Dayani’s husband Manchutan.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[48]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Suganthini, Dayani and her husband were fighting at 9:45 a.m. and the murder happened at roughly 10 a.m.&nbsp; On the Thangarajah family’s evidence, Dayani’s husband left in the morning with Mayuran and his mother to go to Laval and only returned to the apartment later in the day, well after his father had returned.&nbsp; The family’s story, which made it impossible for the brother to be at the apartment during the murder, was corroborated by a witness who saw him at the store, by receipts and by cellular phone records.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[49]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More critically, the evidence as a whole entirely undermined Suganthini’s version of the events.&nbsp; Her initial story was that a thief had come into the apartment through the kitchen door — despite the absence of tracks in the snow — and that she had cut her hand by having it caught in a door.&nbsp; At trial, she changed her story, and attributed the original fabrication to the brother-in-law’s threats.&nbsp; Yet her clothing was found in a bucket of bloody water in the bathroom, her blood was mixed with the blood of the victim on the blade of the knife, her DNA was on the handle, and her cuts were said to be consistent with an injury caused while stabbing someone.&nbsp; There was, on the other hand, no physical evidence linking Dayani’s husband to the offence.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[50]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave a proper <i>W.&nbsp;(D.)</i> instruction, telling the jury that if Suganthini’s testimony or the evidence as a whole left them with reasonable doubt as to her guilt, they must acquit.&nbsp; By convicting Suganthini of second degree murder, the jury clearly rejected her evidence and accepted the version put forward by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Even if we were to entirely ignore the confession evidence, the rest of the evidence in this case so severely undermined Suganthini’s story and bolstered that of the Thangarajah family, that there is no realistic possibility that the verdict would have been different if the jury were differently instructed.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[51]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.</p>
