Prior to adjourning, defence counsel stated in open court that he would be calling three witnesses, including an alibi witness.&nbsp; When the trial resumed the Crown successfully applied to reopen its case and recall the complainant's mother.&nbsp; She testified that she had been mistaken and that she now realized that the accused had stayed with the family in the summer of 1983, not the summer of 1982.&nbsp; The Crown was then granted leave to amend the indictment to extend the time frame to include 1983.&nbsp; The accused testified that he had lived with the complainant's family during the summer of 1983.&nbsp; He was convicted of both counts.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal found that the Crown should not have been permitted to reopen its case or amend the indictment.&nbsp; It quashed the convictions.&nbsp; The Crown appeals to this Court only in respect of the acquittal on the sexual intercourse charge, the amendment to the indictment having resulted in a time frame extending beyond the repeal of the offence of indecent assault.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an appropriate case in which to interfere with the trial judge's exercise of discretion to allow the Crown to reopen its case.&nbsp; Not only had the defence started to meet the Crown's case by declaring its intention to call evidence, but the mother's fresh evidence had the effect of changing the case which the accused had committed himself to answering.&nbsp; Reopening in this case was contrary to the interests of justice and prejudicial to the accused because it violated, indirectly, the fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system that an accused must not be conscripted against himself.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to consider whether the trial judge erred in allowing the amendment to the indictment.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin&nbsp;JJ. (dissenting): The reopening of the case was properly allowed by the trial judge, as was the amendment to the indictment.&nbsp; Neither of these procedural incidents altered the case which the accused had to answer, since he had been made aware at the time of his arrest that the relevant period during which he was alleged to have sexually assaulted the complainant was when he was living at her parents' house, and the accused thus could not have suffered any prejudice of any kind.&nbsp; A trial judge has wide discretion to allow the reopening of the case and such discretion, as long as it is exercised in a manner which does not result in injustice or prejudice to the parties, should not be interfered with.&nbsp; Although in certain circumstances it may be more likely that prejudice will arise if the case is reopened later rather than earlier in the trial, this Court's decision in <i>Robillard</i> definitely eliminated the distinction between cases where the reopening is sought prior to and those where it is sought after the defence has started to answer the case against it, where no prejudice is demonstrated.&nbsp; Here there was no prejudice or denial of full answer and defence in depriving the defence of the opportunity of relying on an irrelevant detail, the dates of the offences, by allowing the Crown to submit fresh evidence which did not change the essential features of the case which the defence had to meet.&nbsp; The key to this flexibility is rooted in <i>B. (G.)</i>, where this Court recognized the difficulties of pinpointing the exact date of sexual assaults against children and the need to accommodate this difficulty in our criminal justice system.&nbsp; In light of the context of child sexual abuse and the difficulty that children have in determining exact dates and times of occurrences, courts must not unduly limit and complicate the trial judge's discretion to reopen the case with inordinate technicalities.&nbsp; Here there was no actual prejudice to the defence.&nbsp; While there must be great value placed on the right of an accused to silence and the presumption against self‑incrimination, these rights have not been violated in this case.</span></p>

(dissenting):&nbsp; The trial judge did not err in allowing the Crown to reopen its case and amend the indictment.&nbsp; While the later the stage at which an application to amend an indictment is made, the greater the chance for injustice to the accused, the discretion of the trial judge is to be exercised in the interests of justice ‑‑ which would comprise consideration of both the interests of the accused and those of the public, including in the latter those of the victim.&nbsp; Here the interests of the accused were not prejudiced.&nbsp; The accused knew before the reopening of the case that the incident had taken place when he resided with his niece, and thus knew exactly the case he had to meet from the beginning.&nbsp; The difficulty of children pinpointing the exact time of incidents which have occurred several years before, but which they are able to define in terms of other contemporaneous matters, should be underlined.</span></p>

Hor, "The Privilege against Self-Incrimination and Fairness to the Accused", [1993] <i>Singapore J. Legal Stud.</i> 35, at p. 35; P. K. McWilliams, <i>Canadian Criminal Evidence</i> (3rd ed. 1988), at para. 1:10100.&nbsp; This means, in effect, that an accused is under no obligation to respond until the state has succeeded in making out a <i>prima facie</i> case against him or her.&nbsp; In other words, until the Crown establishes that there is a "case to meet", an accused is not compellable in a general sense (as opposed to the narrow, testimonial sense) and need not answer the allegations against him or her.</span></p>

B. (G.)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at p. 40, "balance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must be maintained between eschewing unnecessary technicalities and the right of an accused to make full answer and defence".</span></p>

Tremblay</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 932, where the amendment related to the nature of the charge.&nbsp; Rather, the whole of the Crown's case here centred on the fact that the offence had occurred at a time when the accused resided with the parents of the complainant, the specific year being the difficult matter to pinpoint.&nbsp; The accused thus <u>knew</u> before the reopening of the case that the incident had taken place when he had resided with his niece.&nbsp; Indeed, he knew this from the beginning; a police officer had so informed him when he was arrested.&nbsp; In short, the accused knew exactly the case he had to meet from the beginning.&nbsp; I do not think the accused's right against self-incrimination or to silence were affected in any real sense.&nbsp; The case was reopened before the accused presented any evidence.</span></p>

The original charge read that the accused M.B.P. had on or between January 1, 1980 and January 1, 1981 unlawfully assaulted the complainant.&nbsp; Pursuant to the evidence at the preliminary hearing, the Crown amended the charge to specify that the assaults were alleged to have occurred between January 1, 1982 and January 1, 1983.&nbsp; After the close of the Crown's case at trial, however, before the defence adduced any evidence but after having announced its reliance on an alibi defence for the above period, the Crown sought to reopen its case in order to recall the complainant's mother so she might correct her earlier testimony to reflect the actual period where the incidents were alleged to have taken place.</span></p>

Her mother supported her testimony and attested that the complainant had experienced various problems such as bed-wetting and nightmares during late 1985 and 1986.&nbsp; Following this testimony, counsel for the defence pointed out that the complainant had, in fact, been in grade one in the fall of 1984 and not 1985.&nbsp; The Crown sought to amend the indictment to read between November 1, 1985 and December 20, 1985.&nbsp; The trial judge refused to allow the amendment and the three accused were acquitted.&nbsp; On appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the acquittal was overturned on the basis that the time of the offence was not an essential element of the crime.&nbsp; On further appeal, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was upheld.&nbsp; Wilson J. for the Supreme Court said (at p. 40): </span></p>

(G.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, in which this Court recognized the difficulties of pinpointing the exact date of sexual assaults against children and the need to accommodate this difficulty in our criminal justice system.&nbsp; A similar approach was advanced by the English Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Scott</i> (1984), 79 Cr. App. R. 49, in which the court overturned the rule laid down in <i>R. v. Pilcher </i>(1974), 60 Cr. App. R. 1, and concluded that the reopening will depend on the discretion of the trial judge and what could reasonably have been foreseen based on the facts of the particular case and, finally, whether there is prejudice on the specific facts of the case.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The only reason that the Crown sought to reopen its case was because the young abuse victim could not recall the precise dates of events which occurred eight years earlier, although she was able to identify the period during which it occurred, a period the respondent himself recognized.&nbsp; Common sense dictates that the same exacting standard cannot apply in such circumstances as it perhaps should in others.&nbsp; In light of the context of child sexual abuse and the difficulty that children have in determining exact dates and times of occurrences and, most often, have to rely on recollections of surrounding events as well as the assistance of others, courts must not unduly limit and complicate the trial judge's discretion to reopen the case with inordinate technicalities.&nbsp; The reopening of the Crown's case was, in the words of McLennan J.A. in <i>Huluszkiw</i>, "for an honest purpose and . . . there are no unfair consequences to the [respondent] so far as the presentation of that case is concerned" (p. 390).&nbsp; The respondent always knew the case to be met and that he was accused of having fondled the complainant and of having sexual intercourse with her on two occasions during the summer that he lived with the complainant and her family, particularly during the weekend that the respondent was responsible for baby-sitting her.&nbsp; The test for injustice, in my view, is one of actual prejudice to the defence and in the case at hand no such prejudice was suffered by the respondent.&nbsp; The Crown did not seek to reopen its case as a consequence of the defence statements but, rather, in order to remedy an inaccurate testimony that arose through human error.&nbsp; Since the defence counsel was able to seek an adjournment and re-cross-examine the witness, any minimal inconvenience that may have arisen could easily have been remedied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I agree with the Chief Justice that there must be great value placed on the right of an accused to silence and the presumption against self-incrimination, in my view these rights have not been violated in the case at hand and the reopening of this case clearly meets the limited circumstances set out in <i>Robillard</i>.&nbsp; The trial judge properly allowed the Crown to reopen its case in order to accord with the principles advanced by this Court in <i>B. (G.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, and to correct a simple matter of inadvertence given the fact that time is generally not an essential aspect of the offence of sexual assault in cases involving children.&nbsp; Thus, in so doing, no injustice arose to the respondent M.B.P. </span></p>

Dossi</i> (1918), 13 Cr. App. R. 158 (C.C.A.).</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent's main argument rests on the defence of alibi which, in his view, he intended to use and could have used as regards the period mentioned in the amended indictment, alleging the abuse to have occurred between January 1, 1982 to January 1, 1983.&nbsp; As the Chief Justice points out (at p. 567), "[t]he fact that an accused may have an alibi for the period (or part of the period) described in an indictment does not necessarily or automatically "freeze" the dates specified in that indictment.&nbsp; That is to say, there is no vested right to a given alibi.&nbsp; Alibi evidence must respond to the case as presented by the Crown, and not the other way around."&nbsp; Besides, the availability of a particular defence is no bar to the application of s. 601, just as a defence prompted by a simple error or inadvertence by a complainant or Crown cannot be in the interest of justice.&nbsp; This is precisely why s. 601 was enacted -- to avoid having technicalities impair the truth-seeking function of the courts.&nbsp; It seems to me that the amendment here sought by the Crown was precisely for those reasons and fell squarely within the trial judge's discretion.&nbsp; The trial judge, who had heard all the evidence adduced by the Crown before allowing the amendment, was in the best position to assess whether or not the respondent was or could be prejudiced by the amendment.&nbsp; He clearly put his mind to it when he said:</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">. . . there is always difficulty of pinpointing the exact date because of the age of these complainants in trying to remember the time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

-57.6pt;line-height:12.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">. . . the incidences are not changed, we are talking here of people trying to recall a certain date by certain events and the young complainant related it to the van trip.&nbsp; Somebody has made a mistake in the summer of the van trip.&nbsp; I do not believe that this will prejudice the accused in amending that date.</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The Court of Appeal failed to recognize that a finding that the appellant has not been able to rely on the defence of alibi does not necessarily render the amendment prejudicial.&nbsp; In my view, as set out above, it is sufficient that the accused was aware of the case he had to meet and that the offences were alleged to have occurred during the summer he lived with the complainant and her family.&nbsp; As a consequence, the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the amendment "materially changed" the case against the accused to an "altogether different case" is a distortion of the facts of the case at hand.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal erred in substituting its own assessment of the prejudice to the accused for that of the trial judge.&nbsp; Besides, there was no prejudice in this case since the respondent was fully aware of the period the complainant was referring to.&nbsp; The respondent's arguments must, accordingly,&nbsp; fail and the decision of the trial judge must be upheld.</span></p>
