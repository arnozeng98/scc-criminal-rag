About 18 months later, after the accused had been indicted, another resident of the house opened the cardboard box, found the complainant‚Äôs diary and gave it to the defence.&nbsp; At trial, the defence sought to use the diary to contradict the complainant on the basis of entries arguably inconsistent with her evidence-in-chief, and by showing the absence of any entry chronicling physical or sexual abuse.&nbsp; The complainant objected and, at the <i>voir dire</i> into the admissibility of the diary, asserted a privacy interest.&nbsp; The trial judge permitted the accused to use the diary to cross‚Äëexamine the complainant on entries the defence considered probative but did not permit cross‚Äëexamination on the absence of any entries recording physical abuse by the mother or sexual abuse by the accused.</span></p>

24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> McLachlin C.J. and Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache, Binnie, Arbour and LeBel JJ.:&nbsp; Although evidence relating to an accused‚Äôs disposition will generally be excluded, exceptions to this rule arise when the probative value of similar fact evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.&nbsp; In this case, the cogency of the similar fact evidence rests on the validity of the double inference that firstly, the accused had a situation-specific propensity to groom adolescent girls for sexual gratification by exploiting the cult‚Äôs beliefs and its domestic arrangements, and secondly, that he proceeded in that way with each complainant.&nbsp; Similarity and unity of the incidents involving the complainant sisters and the others lay in the accused‚Äôs <i>modus operandi</i>,<i> </i>his abuse of power and the theme of quack spiritualism.&nbsp; These incidents overlapped and were to some extent concurrent. This proximity in time made the evidence more cogent.&nbsp; The incidents were also spread over many years, demonstrating, if believed, a degree of extended consistency in behaviour.&nbsp; Similar fact evidence supported a finding of situation‚Äëspecific behaviour and it was thus open to the jury to draw the double inference. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">That said, the trial judge was then required to consider the countervailing issue of potential moral and reasoning prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; The similar fact evidence had significant potential to create moral prejudice and required a high probative value to be admissible.&nbsp; It was inflammatory, and painted the accused as a ‚Äúbad person‚Äù albeit it was not introduced for that purpose and would only incidentally have that effect.&nbsp; It was introduced in response to issues raised by the defence, namely consent in the case of the complainant believers and the defence that the alleged acts never happened in the case of the housekeeper‚Äôs daughters. </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The combination of sex and spiritualism was inevitably inflammatory.&nbsp; The accused‚Äôs defence to the female complainants who were believers (religiously inspired consent) became more delicate when the jury was told that he also had sexual relations with two sisters from the age of 13&nbsp;who were not disciples but simply residents of his household.&nbsp; Similarly, the accused‚Äôs denial of sexual activity with the housekeeper‚Äôs daughters may have lost much of its force in light of the admitted sexual touching of other adolescent girls, to which the only defence was consent (vitiated, so the jury must have found, by the abuse of authority). </span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>
</div> <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:auto"> </span>
<div class="Section5">
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">With respect to reasoning prejudice, the danger was that the jury might become confused by the multiplicity of incidents, and become distracted by the cumulative force of so many allegations from their task of deciding carefully each charge one by one.&nbsp; However, the accused was not taken by surprise nor limited in his response to any allegation and the jury was properly warned about the prohibition on inferring guilt from general disposition. </span></p>

Moreover, the process of establishing the reliability of the evidence<span lang="EN-GB"> would be time‚Äëconsuming and potentially sidetrack the trial. </span></p>

In the mid-1970‚Äôs, KWG moved out of the house ‚Äúextremely quick[ly]‚Äù. In direct examination on the <i>voir dire</i>, KWG clearly indicated that she thought the belongings she left behind, including her diary, ‚Äúwould be in [her mother‚Äôs] care‚Äù and expected her mother ‚Äúwould give it back to [her]‚Äù. When asked whether she wanted her diary returned to her, KWG adamantly responded, ‚ÄúAbsolutely, every copy and everything else that was in that box.‚Äù</p>

Law</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227, 2002 SCC 10, to resolve this matter.&nbsp; <i>Law</i>, <i>supra</i>, clearly provides that where an individual abandons or relinquishes her property, she effectively abandons her privacy interest in it.&nbsp; The logical corollary to this proposition must be that where an individual retains a privacy interest in her property, she cannot be deemed to have abandoned it.&nbsp; While a person can conceivably relinquish her privacy interests in the contents of her property ‚Äì for example, by reciting every entry in one‚Äôs diary to the general public ‚Äì without also giving up the physical good, the law does not seem to allow for the reverse.</p>

B. LaVacca, ‚ÄúProtecting the Contents of a Personal Diary from Unwanted Eyes‚Äù (1988), 19 <i>Rutgers L.J.</i> 389, at pp. 389‚Äë90.&nbsp; And, as KWG herself appropriately noted, ‚ÄúIt was a diary.&nbsp; Diaries are supposed to be private.‚Äù Hence, the fact that KWG specifically chose to record her thoughts and recollection of daily events in a private, locked diary, rather than, for instance, on a calendar on her bulletin board, post-it notes on the refrigerator, or even her school notebook, suggests to me that she had a high expectation of privacy in what she wrote, <u>regardless</u> of its content.&nbsp; Counsel for the complainant persuasively observed at trial that ‚Äúthe issue surely with respect to privacy is the respect these courts are prepared to pay to the individual‚Äôs ability to write down whatever he or she may choose to write down in one‚Äôs personal diary.&nbsp; That‚Äôs the privacy interest at stake, it‚Äôs not what is written down.‚Äù&nbsp; She went on to draw a powerful analogy between the diary and private therapy records: ‚ÄúSo for example, what if in therapy one didn‚Äôt talk so much about one‚Äôs feelings but about one‚Äôs taste in shopping?&nbsp; It would not, in my submission, detract from the reasonable expectation of privacy to be able to establish that the content of the conversation was X rather than Y.‚Äù</p>

20.85pt;line-height:24.4pt">It can hardly be denied that, in a great number of instances of sexual assaults upon children, probably in most such instances, the complainant does not make any complaint at the time to adults, friends or those who are close to him or her.&nbsp; It should come as no surprise, then, to find that a child would not confide in her diary that an assault of that sort has occurred.&nbsp; Ms. Dickson [counsel for the complainant] argues strongly that there is no probative value in a lack of complaint in these circumstances, and that to allow cross-examination and argument on the issue is premised upon a discriminatory belief or bias.
