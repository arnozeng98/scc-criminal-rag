   <p class="Summary"><span lang="EN-CA">Appellant with two others was charged with conspiracy to use a forged document contrary to s. 326 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>At the preliminary hearing, the Provincial Court Judge was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury properly instructed could convict and accordingly committed the appellant for trial. Appellant successfully petitioned the Supreme Court of British Columbia for <i>certiorari </i>to quash the committal for trial on the ground that there was no evidence before the Provincial Court Judge of his membership in the conspiracy, an essential ingredient of the offence charged, and that therefore, it was beyond the Provincial Judge's jurisdiction to commit in the circumstances. On appeal, the Crown conceded that there was no evidence of a conspiratorial agreement but argued that, in any event, <i>certiorari </i>did not lie to review a committal order under s. 475 of the <i>Code </i>in circumstances where there was no evidence to support that order. The Court of Appeal set aside the order to quash. Hence this appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 94]</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Held </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">(Beetz, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Summary"><i><span lang="EN-CA">Per </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">Dickson, Estey, Lamer and Wilson JJ.: The committal of an accused for trial in the absence of evidence on an essential ingredient of the charge constitutes a jurisdictional error reviewable on <i>certiorari. </i>Under section 475 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>a judge sitting on a preliminary inquiry is called upon to form an opinion as to whether or not the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial. "No evidence" on an essential element of the charge can never amount to "sufficient evidence" under s. 475. The Court must independently assess the record to determine whether there was any evidence to support the committal: it is not bound to accept the Crown's view of the evidence or its submission. The parties cannot alter the record nor convert the appeal into a request for an advisory opinion. Here, where there was some evidence of the accused's membership in the conspiracy, the reviewing judge erred in quashing the committal order. The Crown, however, in the exercise of its enforcement discretion, took as its sole position both here and below that even in the absence of any evidence of an essential element of the charge no review of the decision to commit lay by <i>certiorari; </i>and which position was tantamount to a submission of a reference on a point of law. Instead of seeking a reversal of the order on a ground known to law, the Crown is trying to extend a principle or even to establish new law. This Court, in finding that the order of the reviewing judge should not have been invalidated by the Court of Appeal on the basis advanced by the Crown, is free to restore that order and so leave the Crown in the same position as if it had elected not to appeal the order of the reviewing judge. The prosecutorial arm of the state holds the view that there is no evidentiary basis for the charge against this accused and accordingly he should not be put on trial.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">This litigation has proceeded, since the order of Bouck J., on the footing that there was no evidence of the conspiratorial agreement which, of course, is the bedrock requirement in a charge of conspiracy.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The following is the history of these proceedings in the courts below.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">a) The appellant was committed to trial, after a preliminary inquiry, on a conspiracy charge. The committing judge was "satisfied that there [was] sufficient evidence to put to a jury and sufficient evidence upon which a jury properly instructed could convict". In his reasons for committal, the learned judge adopted the submissions of Crown counsel including the submission that there was evidence from which an inference could be drawn that the appellant had joined the common purpose of tendering forged bonds.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">b) The appellant petitioned the Supreme Court for an order in the nature of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.5pt">certiorari </span></i><span lang="EN-CA">to quash the committal for trial. The ground upon which relief was sought was that the committing judge exceeded his jurisdiction by committing the appellant to trial when there was no evidence of an essential element of the offence with which he was charged, that is, of a conspiratorial agreement.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 97]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">c) Bouck J., who heard the petition to quash, held that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">i) there was no evidence that the accused was a member of the conspiracy alleged;</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">ii) a committal order can be quashed by <i>certiorari </i>when there is a loss of jurisdiction during the preliminary inquiry;</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent2"><span lang="EN-CA">iii) in this case the committing judge lost his jurisdiction when he committed the accused for trial when there was no evidence of his membership in the conspiracy alleged.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Bouck J. accordingly quashed the committal order.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">d) The Crown appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal from the order quashing the committal for trial. The Crown formally abandoned, before the Court of Appeal, the ground of appeal as to whether there was sufficient evidence before the committing judge to support a committal for trial. The appeal was then argued on the basis that Bouck J. was correct in finding that there was no evidence that the appellant had joined the conspiracy.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">e) The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and restored the committal for trial. One cannot be certain whether the majority opinion proceeded on the basis that, in fact and in law, there was 'no evidence' or 'some evidence' in relation to the essential elements of the charge. On the one hand, it is stated by the majority:</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This calls into question the reach of the writ of <i><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">certiorari </span></i>as a tool for the review of committals for trial at preliminary hearings.

In my view, with all respect to those including the courts below who may hold the view to the contrary, a committal cannot survive in these circumstances. The purpose of a preliminary hearing is to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the process. In addition, in the course of its development in this country, the preliminary hearing has become a forum where the accused is afforded an opportunity to discover and to appreciate the case to be made against him at trial where the requisite evidence is found to be present. The status of the preliminary inquiry in the United Kingdom is discussed by Patrick Devlin in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">The Criminal Prosecution in England </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">(1960), </span>at p. 10:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The preliminary inquiry before the magistrates is now a</span><span lang="EN-CA"> purely legal proceeding; it was designed as an instrument of the prosecution for finding the culprit and preparing the evidence against him; it has become a shield for the defence, allowing the defendant to ascertain precisely what the material is that is to be used against him and relieving him from the expense and odium of a trial if in the judgment of impartial persons there is not enough evidence to justify it.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The development of the institution of the preliminary hearing has taken a slightly different course in our country:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The Canadian preliminary inquiry stems from an inquisitorial system of criminal investigation and prosecution in England, in which justices of the peace originally performed all of the investigative functions <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">now performed by the police. The role of the justice of</span> the peace gradually changed and eventually began to take on judicial characteristics. At the same time the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">inquiry over which the justice of the peace presided also</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">changed, becoming mainly a judicial examination of the</span> justification and need for pre-trial detention of the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 106]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">accused as well as an examination of the need for a trial<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> </span>itself. In this proceeding the prosecution was required to<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> </span>present its case, or at least to present sufficient evidence<span style="letter-spacing:
.3pt"> to establish </span><i>a <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">prima facie </span></i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">case. [Footnotes omitted.]</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">(Law Reform Commission of Canada Study Report: </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Discovery in Criminal Cases </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">(1974), </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">at p. 8.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">It is interesting to go back to a description applied by G. Arthur Martin, Q.C., to the preliminary hearing in Canada:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">The preliminary hearing has two aspects. Its primary </span><span lang="EN-CA">purpose, of course, is to ascertain whether or not there is<span style="letter-spacing:
.3pt"> </span>sufficient evidence to warrant the accused being placed<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> </span>upon his trial. In determining this, a magistrate, who is<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> conducting a preliminary hearing is not determining whether or not the accused is guilty or not guilty. His </span>function is to ascertain whether or not there is sufficient<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> evidence to induce the belief in the mind of a cautious man that the accused is probably guilty. Therefore, </span>considerations of reasonable doubt have no application<span style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> at this stage of the proceedings.</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">[…]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.25pt">From the point of view of defence counsel the prelim</span><span lang="EN-CA">inary hearing has another aspect. It affords counsel an opportunity of ascertaining the nature and the strength of the case against his client and it may be likened in that respect to an Examination for Discovery.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">(G. Arthur Martin, Q.C.: "Preliminary Hearings", Special Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada, 1955, p. 1.)</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">In the course of a preliminary hearing, evidence may be adduced through witnesses, exhibits, or admissions. The purpose of adducing evidence is to enable the judge to exercise his jurisdiction by making determinations of fact, applying the law to those facts, and finally, to exercise his discretion to commit or discharge the accused. Where the record established in the preliminary hearing does not include evidence relating to each essential element of the charge brought against the accused, a committal of the accused to stand trial can be brought forward by way of a writ of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">certiorari </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.3pt">to a superior court and can be quashed. I return then to explore the precise effect on these proceedings of the Crown's concession made here and in the Court of Appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 107]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The argument, agreement or undertaking, as the case may be, of a Crown agent as to the consequence to be drawn from testimony taken at trial is not in any way binding upon the Court. Indeed, quite the opposite is true. The Court still must be satisfied that the evidentiary test has been passed or failed, as the case may be, as a matter of law. This includes a burden of proof in some cases and in others the presence or absence, as here, of some evidence to support a committal under s. 475. Neither party, separately or jointly, can alter the record nor convert the appeal into a request for an advisory opinion. It follows that the court is not in any way bound to accept the Crown's view of this evidence nor the Crown submission of law based upon the Crown's view of that evidence. Rather, the Court must independently assess the record to determine whether there was any evidence to support the committal for trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">In my view, here there was some evidence of the </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.1pt">essential element of an agreement. The evidence at</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> the preliminary hearing reveals that the accused came into possession of the bogus bond which had </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">been prepared by others alleged to be the accused's</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">co-conspirators. The evidence further revealed that</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"> at an earlier time a person alleged to be a co-conspirator had caused the counterfeit bond to be created and had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade an employee at a branch of a trust company to cash the counterfeit bond. The accused, according to the evidence, later took the bogus bond to the same branch of the trust company where the aforementioned employee worked, and cashed the bond. It should here be noted that the evidence includes a denial by the unindicted co-conspirator and by the employee of the trust company, unsuccessfully importuned as aforesaid, of any knowledge of or relationship with the accused. The evidence further reveals that the accused, in presenting the bond at the trust company, did not approach that employee for the purpose of cashing the bond. From this evidence it </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">is remotely but nonetheless possible, in my view, to</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.2pt"> distill an agreement between the accused and the creators of the counterfeit bond to convert the bond to cash by presenting it to a trust company or a bank. This evidence approaches the traditional</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 108]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">expression "a scintilla of evidence" but falls short of what may be classified as fanciful. Consequently, there can be gleaned from the record 'some evidence' to support the action of committal. In so stating, it must always be added that the "some evidence" and "no evidence" rules must relate to all the essential elements of the charge in question.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">The conclusion which I have reached, that there was a scintilla of evidence to support the committal of the appellant to trial, brings us back full circle to the unusual procedural history of this case. On appeal, the Crown did not seek to impeach the finding of Bouck J. that there was 'no evidence' of a conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was argued that in any event <i>certiorari </i>was not available to review for 'no evidence' at all on the essential elements of the charge. The executive branch of government has assumed primary responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law. The historic ascendency of the executive branch as the agency for the enforcement of criminal law in the community is recognized in Canada today, in fact and in law, in the </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt"><i>Criminal </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Code</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt"></span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.3pt"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">where it is given an ascendency at critical junctures of a prosecution over the private prosecutor. This branch may, in its wisdom, decide to lay or not to lay a charge. It might decide at any stage in the process to withdraw the charge. The Attorney General of the province, as represented by the Crown agent in the courtroom, might, for example, decide to withdraw a charge in the course of a preliminary hearing. Similarly, the charge might be withdrawn with the permission of the Court in the course of a trial. The following dicta of Schroeder J.A. in <i>City of Toronto v. Polai </i>(1969), 8 D.L.R. (3d) 689 in a different context, accurately, in my view, reflects the importance of the role assumed by the executive with respect to criminal prosecutions (at p. 697):</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The decision whether or not the Attorney-General should prosecute or sue is a matter for him, and the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 109]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Courts have no power to question his right to do so or to<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>refrain from doing so as distinct from his right to relief.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The Attorney-General is in a different position from<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"> </span>the ordinary litigant, for he represents the public inter<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">est in the community at large; …</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The Crown agent in this case might have decided, in its exclusive discretion as the public enforcement agency of the community, the executive branch, not to oppose the application for an order to quash; or the Crown might have decided not to appeal from the quashing order. Here the Crown exercised its enforcement discretion by asking the Court of Appeal, and this Court as well, to set aside the quashing order on a ground not known to the law. No other request was made by the Crown, and indeed, the Crown expressed its agreement that the Court should dispose of the appeal on the one ground selected by the Crown. The sole position taken by the Crown on this appeal in this Court, and apparently in the court below, is tantamount to a submission of a Reference on a point of law to this Court. The Crown does not here seek a reversal of the order of the reviewing judge of first instance on a ground known to the law. Rather the Crown seeks to establish a new or extended rule of law.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Whether there is, in the judicial sense, 'no evidence' revealed in the record, is a question of law. In finding there was 'no evidence' in the record at the preliminary hearing, the learned reviewing judge committed an error of law. Such a finding, unsupported by the record, is, in my view, a reversible error which, in the absence of other overriding considerations, would dispose of the appeal.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">There now remains to be examined the question as to whether these proceedings reveal a further and finally controlling factor which ordains another disposition of the proceeding. This Court, on the review of the proceedings below, must conclude that, while the committing judge was in law correct in his order under s. 475, and the reviewing judge was wrong in law in quashing the committal, the quashing order was attacked by the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 110]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Crown on a basis unknown to the law. The Crown in its executive role can, at that point, elect not to appeal or to appeal on a limited basis, or to appeal from the order on all possible grounds known to the law. The Crown role continues at this stage in the same way as in the earliest stages of the process when it determines whether to lay a charge, against whom the charge should be laid, and if so, whether to proceed to or by way of the preliminary hearing.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">In determining the proper disposition to be made of this appeal, one should not overlook the effect the position taken by the Crown in the appellate process has had, not only upon the criminal process itself but upon the accused. The accused has not been called upon to address the issue of 'no evidence' in either the Court of Appeal or in this Court. He has not been called upon to meet the 'no evidence' or 'some evidence' issue because of the quasi-reference approach taken by the Crown in the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">form </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">of an appeal from the order of Bouck J.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">As a result of all these proceedings and steps, this Court, making the order which is respectfully found to be the order which the Court of Appeal should have made, finds that this appeal should be allowed and the order of the reviewing judge restored. This is the disposition which must, in law, follow from the course chosen by the executive branch in the discharge of its function as an agency charged with law enforcement in the province. The Crown having pursued this course, as in its wisdom it is free to do, the result must be the restoration of the order quashing the committal. The focus of this entire process is on the liberty of the subject. The appellant stands accused under the criminal law. The agency charged with the administration of justice on behalf of the Crown in the right of the province has, upon its investigation and initial prosecutorial steps, determined that the community is possessed of no evidence that the</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 111]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">accused is guilty of the conspiracy charged. Can the community be expected to tolerate, let alone support, a law which permits a person, against whom the state enforcement agency claims possession of no evidence of guilt as charged, to be prosecuted on such a charge with the full power and resources of the state? This is not an absence of process; it is an abandonment of process. It is fundamental to our criminal law traditions that no citizen shall be called upon to answer a charge in this stark circumstance. Any other criminal law technique is but organized tyranny focussed on the wrongly accused in the view of the arm of the state empowered to initiate and process that accusation. Section 475 cannot, in my opinion, be properly construed in the tradition of statutory interpretation of criminal statutes as requiring such a startling result in a free society.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">It follows that in doing so, the Court has not treated itself as bound by, nor indeed in any way has it acted upon, the submission by the Crown that there was no evidence of each essential element of the charge. Rather, the Court has responded to the only position taken by the prosecution.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.2pt">I therefore would allow the appeal and restore the order of Bouck J. in Chambers in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.</span></p>

   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">stay of proceedings was entered in respect of Grenon, who gave evidence for the Crown, and Pellerin did not appear. The hearing proceeded in respect of the appellant Skogman.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">The evidence revealed that Grenon worked in the office of the Queen's Printer in Victoria. Early in the year 1980 he stole an unnumbered British Columbia School District's Capital Financing Authority debenture having a face value of $25,000. The debenture was dated May 1, 1966 and it had coupons attached, each in the amount of $781.25, dated November 1 and May 1 for each year up to 1986. He retained it in his possession until October, 1980 when he mentioned it to his co-accused, Pellerin. They decided to negotiate the bond or the coupons or both. The two, Grenon and Pellerin, went to the office of the Queen's Printer where Grenon made a casting of a serial number so that it could be stamped on the debenture and its coupons. He gave the casting to Pellerin who by this time had the debenture. Pellerin then spoke to a woman friend who was employed by the Royal Trust Company at its branch on Grant Street in Victoria. He endeavoured to make arrangements with her to negotiate the debenture, but she refused.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">At about the end of October the appellant Skogman opened an account at the Grant Street Branch of the Royal Trust Company in the name of one Brune who was an acquaintance, but who knew nothing of the account. The appellant then handed over for negotiation the coupons from the debenture. The coupons bore a fictitious number and had a face value of $14,843.75. On surrender of the coupons the appellant received from the trust company $2,500 cash, and the remaining $12,343.75 was deposited to the account he had opened in the name of Brune.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">There was evidence identifying the appellant as the person who handed over the coupons to the Royal Trust Company on October 31 at the Grant Street branch, but there was no direct evidence of any association between the appellant and the other alleged conspirators. However, in argument</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 113]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">at the preliminary hearing, counsel for the Crown said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Mr. Pellerin gained access and custody of the coupons. He showed them to Heather Robb and Heather Robb says, "Yes, those are the items and I told him that they wouldn't pass muster because they look smudged and they are obvious forgeries."</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The coupons then go from Mr. Pellerin somehow to Mr. Scogman <i><span style="letter-spacing:.7pt">[sic] </span></i>and an inference can be drawn—and I suggest it is the only inference that can be drawn—that Mr. Scogman [sic] then joins the common purpose.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">We have the identification of the coupons in Pellerin's</span><span lang="EN-CA"> <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">hands and we next have Mr. Scogman</span> <i>[sic] </i><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">showing up</span> at Royal Trust.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">And at the conclusion of the hearing, the Provincial Court Judge said in part:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I am adopting, as my reasons for committing, the <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">submissions made by Crown counsel, Mr. Macdonald,</span> who summarized the case.

   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I therefore am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to put to a jury and sufficient evidence upon which a jury properly instructed could convict.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I therefore commit the accused for trial before Judge <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">and Jury at the next court of competent jurisdiction and</span> I am referring to the accused, Larry Cliff Scogman [sic].</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The appellant petitioned the Supreme Court for an order in the nature </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.7pt">of </span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:1.1pt">certiorari</span></i><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.7pt"> </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:

Essentially, the grounds upon which relief was sought were that evidence of an agreement between the appellant and one or more of his co-conspirators, a necessary ingredient of the charge of conspiracy, had not been tendered. It was contended that there was no evidence before the committing Provincial Court Judge of any such agreement between the appellant and the others and, therefore, there was not sufficient evidence to justify a committal. It was therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court Judge to commit in the circumstances.</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 114]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">The Chambers Judge in the Supreme Court who heard the petition wrote </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%">a </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:

He quashed the committal. At the conclusion of his reasons for judgment the Chambers Judge conveniently summarized his conclusions under six headings. The second conclusion he reached was in these terms:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(2) At the preliminary hearing, there was no evidence <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">the accused was a member of the conspiracy alleged</span> in the information. Put another way, there was an entire absence of evidence as a basis for the formation of a judicial opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial. There was only circumstantial evidence which gives rise to rational inferences other than his membership in the conspiracy.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">The fourth, fifth and sixth conclusions were in these terms:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(4) The Supreme Court of Canada has approved the practice of quashing committal orders by <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.3pt">certiorari </span></i>when there is a loss of jurisdiction during the preliminary enquiry. Examples of how this can <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">occur include denial of natural justice and failure to</span> observe a mandatory provision of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal Code.</span></i></span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(5) There was no breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of the committal proceedings.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">(6) The Provincial Court Judge lost jurisdiction at the <span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">preliminary inquiry when he failed to observe s. 475</span> of the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Criminal Code </span></i>because he committed the <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">accused for trial when there was no evidence of his</span> membership in the conspiracy which justified the committal order, or put another way, there was an entire absence of evidence as a basis for the formation of a judicial opinion by him that the evidence of his membership in the conspiracy was sufficient to put the accused on trial.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.2pt">The Court of Appeal was unanimous in allowing the Crown's appeal. McFarlane J.A. wrote reasons with which Craig J.A. concurred. Lambert J.A. concurred in the result but wrote separate reasons. McFarlane J.A., after outlining the facts, said:</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 115]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The appeal by the Crown to this Court is presented on the assumption that there was no evidence to support the Provincial Court Judge's opinion. It is, of course, not conceded or assumed that the circumstances did not require the Provincial Court Judge to apply his mind to the question whether he should or should not be of opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial. It is not suggested that there was such a complete absence of evidence that s. 475(1) could not be invoked or applied at all. The contrary is the case. There can be no doubt that at the conclusion of hearing of the evidence presented by the Crown, the Provincial Court Judge was required to form his opinion on the application of s-s. 1(a) and 1(b), i.e., to commit or discharge. The distinction is important because it points up the difference between the acquisition of jurisdiction by the Provincial Court Judge and the loss of a jurisdiction once properly acquired.</span></p>

   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 117]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">In approaching the case at bar I refer, firstly, to <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Patterson v. The Queen </span></i>where, at a preliminary hearing into a charge of using an instrument to procure a miscarriage, the committing magistrate refused to order the production of statements made by two Crown witnesses. The accused was committed for trial and on application for a writ of <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">certiorari </span></i>the committal was quashed. The committal was restored in the Court of Appeal and the accused appealed to this Court. Judson J., speaking for himself, Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, and Pigeon JJ., Spence J. dissenting, said at pp. 411-12:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">I intend to confine these reasons within the very narrow issues raised by the case and to repeat what has <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">been emphasized so often that if it is sought to review a</span> committal for trial, there is only one ground for action by the reviewing Court and that is lack of jurisdiction. The refusal by the magistrate, on this hearing, to order production of these statements does not go to the question of jurisdiction. In the first place, I think that his ruling was correct and, further, even if it was in error that there would still be no problem of jurisdiction.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Hall J. concurred in the result. This case I take to be clear authority for the proposition that an error in law during the course of exercising a jurisdiction is not itself jurisdictional and will not be reviewed on <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">certiorari. </span></i>The <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Patterson </span></i>case was followed and approved in this Court in <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Attorney General of Quebec v. Cohen. </span></i>Pigeon J. wrote the judgment in this Court in the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Cohen </span></i>case and referred with approval to the case of <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Norgren </span></i>in the British Columbia Court of Appeal which dealt with the same point. The British Columbia Court of Appeal later followed and approved <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">Norgren </span></i>in the case of <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Kopan. </span></i>These cases all have their roots in the judgment of Lord Sumner in the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Nat Bell </span></i>case and carry the authority of this Court.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">The two cases upon which most of the argument centred in this appeal are <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Re Martin, Simard and </span>Desjardins <span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">and The Queen </span></i>in the Ontario Court of Appeal and in this Court, and <i><span style="letter-spacing:
.2pt">Forsythe v. The Queen </span></i>in this Court. It was argued that these cases had modified, or at least cast doubt on, the earlier cases relied upon by the Crown. In the <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">Martin </span></i>case</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 118]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">orders of committal had been made after a preliminary hearing and then quashed in the High Court on </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">certiorari. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The basis of the quashing order in the High Court was that there was error of law on the face of the record. The issue in the Court of Appeal then became, in the words of Estey C.J.O. (as he then was), "whether </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">certiorari is </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">available to quash a committal for trial where there is an error of law on the face of the record" (p. 484). He went on to say that the Court of Appeal of Ontario had already applied the principle that excess or want of jurisdiction was the only ground upon which </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">certiorari </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">might apply and referred on this point to the Ontario cases of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">R. v. Botting, </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt">[1966] 3 C.C.C. 373 and </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Re Stewart and The Queen (No. </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">2) (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 281, and to the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Norgren </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">case in the British Columbia Court of Appeal. He then observed, as I have done, that these cases find their roots in the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Nat Bell </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">case. As to the extent of review on jurisdictional grounds, he referred to the words of Lord Sumner in the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Nat Bell </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">case to the effect that:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">On <i>certiorari, </i>so far as the presence or absence of <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">evidence becomes material, the question can, at most, be</span> whether any evidence at all was given on the essential point referred to. Its weight is entirely for the inferior Court:...</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Estey C.J.O. then went on to say, at pp. 486-87:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">The <i>Code </i>asserts this principle. Where there is any <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">evidence at all upon a charge or issue arising thereunder,</span> the Provincial Court Judge is called upon by s. 475 of the <i>Code </i>to hear it and determine "if in his opinion the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial ... "; and his decision is not subject to review.</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">Applying these judgments, some of which are binding<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:
-.2pt">upon this Court, we conclude that the learned Provincial</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">Court Judge here acted within his jurisdiction, unless it</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">can be said that he committed these respondents on the</span><span style="letter-spacing:
-.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">counts specified without any evidence at all, in the sense</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">of an entire absence of proper material as a basis for the</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"> formation of a judicial opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial. That is quite a</span></span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 119]</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA">different question from the question "whether in the opinion of the reviewing tribunal there was evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting judicially could convict". It remained, therefore, to examine the excerpts of evidence, as placed before this Court from the lengthy transcript taken at the preliminary hearing, <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">in order to determine whether there was any evidence at</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">all on which the committing tribunal was able to base its</span> <span style="letter-spacing:
-.2pt">opinion to commit, as required by the terms of the</span> </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.4pt">Code </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.2pt">already cited. There is, of course, a considerable volume</span><span lang="EN-CA"> of evidence, testimonial and documentary, and it is my view that in the case of each of the three respondents there is sufficient evidence relating to the charges and the counts in issue to call upon the learned Provincial Judge to form an opinion as to whether there was sufficient evidence to commit the accused for trial, pursuant to s. 475, .... Having properly directed his mind to the evidence and to the question of whether there was "sufficient evidence" to commit, his decision is not subject to review.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">The order to quash was reversed. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">In the </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.5pt">Martin </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">case Estey C.J.O. went far to rationalize the conflicting case law on this question. As I read his judgment in that case, he recognized that the remedy of </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.5pt">certiorari </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">was jurisdictional and that it could be invoked only to cure jurisdictional error. He went on to say that it would lie to quash a committal for trial on this basis only where there was a total absence of evidence before the committing justice on which he could commit. He went on to state the test of sufficiency of evidence for a committal and drew a distinction between that amount of evidence which would warrant a committal for trial, and that lesser amount which, though not being sufficient to warrant a committal, would be sufficient to compel the committing justice to examine the evidence and reach a judicial opinion as to its sufficiency. He concluded by saying that there was such evidence, that is, evidence sufficient to put the committing justice to a decision as to its sufficiency and that, after the committing justice had addressed his mind to the evidence and reached his conclusion, the decision was not reviewable on </span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height:150%;letter-spacing:.5pt">certiorari </span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">even though wrong in law. This judgment was affirmed in this Court and is, in my view, consistent with the judgment of this</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 120]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">Court in <i>Forsythe </i>in which case it was held that only a denial of natural justice or a failure to obey the jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>would justify a review and quashing of a committal by <i>certiorari.</i></span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:.1pt">To apply the above proposition to the case at bar, it should first be recognized that the parties argued the case before us on the basis that there was no evidence before the trial judge. Counsel for the Crown put it that there was no evidence of an essential ingredient of a charge of conspiracy, that is, evidence of agreement. While it could be said then that there was no evidence sufficient to meet the test for a committal—evidence which, if believed by a properly instructed jury, would justify a conviction—it could not be said that there was no evidence at all. The evidence disclosed that Grenon had stolen the debenture and the coupons. He had then given them to Pellerin and made a moulding from which a false serial number was made and put on the documents. The evidence also showed that Pellerin had approached an employee of the Royal Trust Company branch office on Grant Street in Victoria and had attempted to arrange for the negotiation of the debenture or coupons. She refused to cooperate but, after a day or two, the appellant went to the same branch of the Royal Trust Company, opened an account and negotiated the debenture coupons under a false name.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">Now the parties have conceded that there was no direct evidence of association. Whatever one might think of the validity of such a concession by the Crown, it is abundantly clear that the committing justice, having heard the evidence described above, was confronted with the task of deciding whether or not there was evidence of association, and whether or not there was evidence to warrant a committal. There was no absolute lack of evidence,</span></p> 
   <p class="Page"><span lang="EN-CA">[page 121]</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;as described by Estey C.J.O. in <i>Martin. </i>The formation of a judicial opinion by the committing justice was therefore required under s. 475 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The justice's words in giving judgment reveal that he addressed the evidence and formed his opinion as to its sufficiency. His judgment then is not reviewable in proceedings by <i>certiorari. </i>It should be remembered that there were no concessions as to sufficiency of evidence made before the committing justice. He was required to address the question and reach his own conclusion. He did so, and, even though it may have been wrong in law, it is, in my view, unreviewable.</span></p> 
   <p class="Para"><span lang="EN-CA">This question came to this Court again in the case of <i>Forsythe v. The Queen. </i>In that case, on a preliminary inquiry concerning a charge of rape, the appellant was denied the right to question the complainant with respect to her past sexual conduct with persons other than the accused in the <i>in camera </i>hearing held under s. 142 of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>He was also refused the right to examine the notes of a police officer made during an interview with the complainant and to cross-examine on them. He was committed for trial. He applied for an order quashing the committal which was denied in the Supreme Court of Ontario and his appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. He appealed to this Court. The Chief Justice wrote the judgment for a unanimous Court and held that <i>certiorari </i>may be involved to quash a committal. He referred to the <i>Patterson </i>case and said, at pp. 271-72:</span></p> 
   <p class="Indent1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">In speaking of lack of jurisdiction, this Court was not</span><span lang="EN-CA"> referring to lack of initial jurisdiction of a judge or a magistrate to enter upon a preliminary inquiry.
