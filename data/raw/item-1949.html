24.4pt"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Per</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> Iacobucci, Major, Binnie and Arbour JJ. (dissenting):&nbsp; The trial judge found as a fact that there was no independent and objective review by the Crown prosecutors in this case.&nbsp; The absence of the usual and proper checks and balances would, he thought, shock the conscience of the community.&nbsp; He cited a number of concerns that reflected this institutional failure, but his listing of the symptoms should not be mistaken for his important and central finding of fact that the accused had been denied his constitutional right to a fair pre‚Äëtrial procedure.&nbsp; No reason has been shown to set aside this critical finding of fact.&nbsp; The conclusion that well‚Äëinformed people may reasonably take from the continued prosecution of what the former Director of Public Prosecutions described as ‚Äúminor‚Äù allegations 24 to 34 years after the events are said to have taken place is that the accused is being pursued not so much for what he has done as for who he is.&nbsp; Such a perception undermines public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the criminal justice system. </span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:57.6pt;line-height:
24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The courts are very slow to second‚Äëguess the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and do so only in narrow circumstances, but these extensive discretionary powers must be exercised with objectivity and dispassion.&nbsp; Here, the failure of the proper and usual institutional checks and balances prevented the objective review of charges laid by the police that, because of their staleness, relatively minor nature (compared with those that did go to trial) and the potentially light sentences even if convicted, would likely have been stopped if an objective review had taken place.</span></p>

24.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The preferral of a direct indictment by the Attorney General did not ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù the prior errors of judgment of the Crown attorneys.&nbsp; It was motivated by an understandable desire to bring to an end a preliminary inquiry that had lasted almost a year, and cannot be taken as having belatedly supplied the objective and dispassionate review of the original charging decision that, in the trial judge‚Äôs view, had never taken place.&nbsp; A stay of proceedings was appropriate in this case.&nbsp; The absence of the proper checks and balances between police and prosecutor led to an increase in the number of charges laid against the accused.&nbsp; The trial judge concluded that the Crown‚Äôs loss of objectivity and improper motive will be ‚Äúmanifested, perpetuated or aggravated‚Äù through the continued prosecution of the charges to which these abuses of process gave rise.&nbsp; If the trial itself would not have occurred but for the abusive conduct, then the trial itself necessarily perpetuates the abuse.&nbsp; The only way to halt this continued prejudice to the accused is a stay of proceedings.</span></p>

MacDonald A.C.J. acknowledged that this third criterion would play a significant part in his analysis. In approaching the issue, MacDonald A.C.J. noted that he had to weigh the cumulative effect of any alleged wrongdoing.&nbsp; He was also mindful that abuse of process need not be driven by evidence of <i>mala fides</i> to warrant a stay, although such evidence was certainly relevant.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:24.4pt">L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√© J. also acknowledged the existence of a residual category of abuse of process in which the individual‚Äôs right to a fair trial is not implicated.&nbsp; She described this category, which is invoked in the present appeal, as follows in <i>O‚ÄôConnor</i>, at para. 73:</p>

The pre-charge interviews were done in accordance with the common practice of some other provinces, a practice more wide-ranging than the narrow, exceptional to rare practice the trial judge described.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Crown conducted an understandable review of the potential witnesses, in the wake of an early&nbsp; recommendation by DPP Pearson that was not determinative.&nbsp; Given the uncertainty of the charges at that point, it could not be known whether the re-interviews led to more charges than would otherwise have been laid.&nbsp;&nbsp; I conclude that, based on the evidence of judge shopping, pre-charge Crown interviews, the improper police announcement, and the addition of count 16 in the direct indictment, the cumulative effect of these actions, while troubling in some respects, does not rise to the level of abuse of process which is egregious, vexatious, oppressive or which would offend the community‚Äôs sense of decency and fair play.&nbsp; Moreover, this conduct, even if it did amount to an abuse, did not have an ongoing effect on the accused, which would jeopardize the fairness of his trial.&nbsp; On that basis, I must now turn to the central issue decided by the Court of Appeal, namely the decision to lift the stay of proceedings ordered by the trial judge.&nbsp;</p>

Cromwell J.A. therefore reasoned that even if Crown Potts‚Äô involvement in the process, and more generally the Crown‚Äôs participation in pre-charge interviews, had tainted the process, by the time of the direct indictment, Crown Potts was no longer on the case, and the direct indictment itself amounted to a remedy which cleansed any earlier abuse.&nbsp;</p>

(See, for example, <i>R</i>. <i>v.</i> <i>Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577; <i>O‚ÄôConnor</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R</i>.<i> v.</i> <i>Ewanchuk</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330; <i>R</i>. <i>v.</i> <i>Mills</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668; <i>R</i>.<i> v.</i> <i>Darrach</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, 2000 SCC 46.)&nbsp; Without revisiting the thoughtful consideration of those judgments in the current case, it suffices to say that those gains would amount to nothing if modern charges of sexual assault for historic acts are viewed with blinkers and through a looking glass that sees an old stereotypic view rather than an enlightened one. It is not for this Court to judge the Crown‚Äôs assessment of social interests in proceeding with historic sexual assault charges.&nbsp; It is, however, appropriate for this Court to review lower court decisions according to the standards of modern jurisprudence.&nbsp; Furthermore, when exercising their discretion to grant a stay, courts are bound to consider all significant factors, a requirement by which the Crown is not bound when making its charging decisions.&nbsp; It was not sufficient for the trial judge to merely follow the course set by DPP Pearson.</p>

FALKINGHAM that Crown review the evidence and consider laying charges in all instances so that the gravity of the subject‚Äôs actions be properly presented to give the full picture.</p>
