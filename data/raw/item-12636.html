 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Per</i> Cromwell&nbsp;J. (dissenting): &nbsp;Risk of danger is not an element of the offence of care or control.&nbsp; The attempt to limit by means of statutory interpretation the potentially wide ambit of the care or control offence by reading in both this new essential element and a new evidentiary rule that operates against the accused is not consistent with well‑settled principles of statutory interpretation and seriously undercuts the provision’s preventive purpose.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial judge erred in law by holding that the risk of danger was an essential element of the offence.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of what the expression “care or control” means in <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en#!fragment/sec253subsec1" target="_blank">s.&nbsp;253(1)<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> is an issue of statutory interpretation.&nbsp; “Care or control” are not technical legal words in the context of the provision.&nbsp; If the ordinary meaning of these words applies, one is in care or control of a motor vehicle when one acts to assume the present ability to operate the vehicle or has its superintendence or management.&nbsp; The scheme and object of the provision suggest that Parliament intended the ordinary meaning to apply.&nbsp; The purpose of criminalizing having care or control of a vehicle while impaired is preventive.&nbsp; While the evil is the danger of impaired operation of a vehicle, a wider ambit of criminality has been created to prevent that evil from materializing. </span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 253 being preventive in nature, the element of risk will be relevant to the assessment of whether the person has care or control of a motor vehicle.&nbsp; Since the intention of driving the vehicle is not pertinent under the care or control offence, the risk must be assessed by looking at the accused’s use of the vehicle.&nbsp; If an accused acts to assume the present ability to operate the vehicle or its superintendence or management, there is an inherent risk of danger, unless objectively viewed, the accused’s use of the vehicle involves no such risk.&nbsp; Accordingly, not all acts in relation to a vehicle will necessarily constitute acts of care or control.&nbsp; The degree of involvement of the accused with the vehicle will need to be more than trivial to constitute care or control.&nbsp; The determination of whether the accused was in care or control will depend upon a careful consideration of the particular facts of the case.</span></p>
 <p class="SCCNormalDoubleSpacing" style="margin-bottom:24.0pt"><span style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, even if the creation of risk were an essential element of the offence, the trial judge erred in law in finding that it had not been proved.&nbsp; There is no dispute that the absence of intent to set the vehicle in motion is not a defence, but the trial judge in effect made it so by basing his conclusion that there was no risk on evidence that B did not intend to drive.&nbsp; Having found this legal error, the Court of Appeal was correct to set aside the acquittals and enter convictions.&nbsp; When applying the correct legal test, care or control was amply proved in the present case.</span><span style="line-height:200%"> </span></p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[11]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The existence of a realistic risk of danger is a matter of fact.&nbsp; In this case, the trial judge, applying the correct legal test, found <i>as a fact</i> that there was no such risk.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[18]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At around 10:00 a.m., Mr. Boudreault decided to go home.&nbsp; By his own admission, he was inebriated and unfit to drive.&nbsp; At Mr. Boudreault’s request, Ms. Dubois called a taxi for him.&nbsp; The service she called, “Taxic”, sends two drivers — one to take the inebriated motorist home, and the other to drive his vehicle.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[19]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After 20 to 25 minutes — an unusually long time, since Mr. Boudreault had used the Taxic service in the past and its drivers had arrived immediately (“<i>tout de suite</i>” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 86)) — there was still no sign of the taxi.&nbsp; Ms. Dubois called Taxic once more.&nbsp; At that point, wanting to go to sleep, Ms. Dubois asked Mr. Boudreault to wait outside: [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">translation</span>] “. . . go warm up your truck,” she said, “the taxi is coming” (A.R., vol.

He started the engine, turned on the heat, and fell asleep.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[21]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 10:44 a.m., the police received a call from the Taxic driver, who had arrived at Ms. Dubois’s home and reported seeing a man sleeping in the driver’s seat of a motor vehicle.&nbsp; The police arrested Mr. Boudreault shortly thereafter.&nbsp; His ability to drive was manifestly impaired.&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[22]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon arrest, Mr. Boudreault asked that he be left alone so that he could drive home.&nbsp; The trial judge attached no probative weight to this statement and took care to explain his conclusion in this regard.&nbsp; At the police station, a breathalyzer test yielded results of 250 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood at 11:40 a.m. and 242 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood at 12:05 p.m. — both over three times the legal limit of 80 mg/100 mL.</p>

The Queen</i>, [1967] S.C.R. 284, where the accused, while impaired, was found in the driver’s seat of an <i>inoperable </i>vehicle but was nonetheless convicted of “care or control” while impaired.&nbsp; To the extent that <i>Saunders</i> may be interpreted to exclude a risk of danger as an element of “care or control”, it has since been overtaken by subsequent decisions of the Court, notably <i>R. v. Toews</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119, and <i>R. v. Penno</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 865.</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acts of care or control, short of driving, are acts which involve some use of the car or its fittings and equipment, or some course of conduct associated with the vehicle <u>which would involve a risk of putting the vehicle in motion so that it could become dangerous</u>.

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[31]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And in <i>Penno</i>, citing <i>Toews</i>, Lamer C.J. reaffirmed the requirement of risk of danger in these terms:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law . . . is not deprived of any flexibility and does not go so far as to punish the mere presence of an individual whose ability to drive is impaired in a motor vehicle. In fact, <i>Toews</i> stands for the proposition that <u>when a person uses a vehicle in a way that involves no risk of putting it in motion so that it could become dangerous, the courts should find that the <i>actus reus</i> was not present</u>.

Accordingly, an <i>intention</i> to set the vehicle in motion suffices <i>in itself</i> to create the risk of danger contemplated by the offence of care or control.&nbsp; On the other hand, an accused who satisfies the court that he or she had no intention to set the vehicle in motion will not necessarily escape conviction:&nbsp; An inebriated individual who is found behind the wheel and has a present ability to set the vehicle in motion — without intending at that moment to do so — may nevertheless present a realistic risk of danger.</p>

First, an inebriated person who initially does not intend to drive may later, while still impaired, change his or her mind and proceed to do so; second, an inebriated person behind the wheel may unintentionally set the vehicle in motion; and third, through negligence, bad judgment or otherwise, a stationary or inoperable vehicle may endanger persons or property.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[44]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown contends that a risk of danger is not an essential element of care or control under s. 253(1) of the <i>Code</i>.&nbsp; It submits that, even where the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(<i>a</i>) is not engaged, the Crown need only prove voluntary consumption of alcohol beyond the legal limit (or leading to impairment) and “some use of the car or its fittings and equipment” (R.F., at para. 32, citing <i>Toews</i>, at p. 126).&nbsp; Accordingly, in the Crown’s submission, an inebriated accused found behind the wheel of a car, with the key in the ignition and the motor running, is subject to automatic conviction.</p>

Szymanski</i> (2009), 88 M.V.R. (5th) 182 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 93, <i>per</i> Durno J.; <i>R. v. Ross</i>, 2007 ONCJ 59, 44 M.V.R. (5th) 275, at para. 14, <i>per</i> Duncan J.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[52]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impact of an “alternate plan” of this sort on the court’s assessment of the risk of danger depends on two considerations: first, whether the plan itself was objectively concrete and reliable; second, whether it was in fact implemented by the accused.&nbsp; A plan may seem watertight, but the accused’s level of impairment, demeanour or actions may demonstrate that there was nevertheless a realistic risk that the plan would be abandoned before its implementation.&nbsp; Where judgment is impaired by alcohol, it cannot be lightly assumed that the actions of the accused when behind the wheel will accord with his or her intentions either then or afterward.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[53]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, even where it is certain that the taxi will show up at some point, if the accused occupied the driver’s seat without a valid excuse or reasonable explanation, this alone may persuade the judge that “his judgment [was] so impaired that he [could not] foresee the possible consequences of his actions”: <i>Toews</i>, at p. 126, again citing <i>Price</i>,<i> </i>at p. 384.&nbsp; The converse, however, is not necessarily true.&nbsp; Even where it is probable that the taxi will appear at some point and the accused occupied the driver’s seat <i>with </i>a valid excuse or reasonable explanation, the trial judge may nonetheless be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there remained a realistic risk of danger in the circumstances.</p>

This appeal concerns whether the trial judge properly interpreted and applied the elements of the care or control offence in the appellant’s case.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[59]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that in order for the accused to be in “care or control” of a vehicle, his acts in relation to it must give rise to a risk of danger.&nbsp; In other words, creation of a risk of danger is an essential element of the offence.&nbsp; The judge also found that there was no such risk here because the appellant did not intend to drive. My colleague Fish J. would uphold these findings. I respectfully disagree.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[60]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My view is that risk of danger is not an element of the offence.&nbsp; My colleague attempts to limit by means of statutory interpretation the potentially wide ambit of the care or control offence by reading in both this new essential element and a new evidentiary rule that operates against the accused.&nbsp; Respectfully, this result is not consistent with well-settled principles of statutory interpretation. In addition, this approach, in my respectful view, seriously undercuts the provision’s preventive purpose.&nbsp; In any event, even if the creation of risk were an essential element of the offence, the trial judge erred in law in finding that it had not been proved.&nbsp; There is no dispute that the absence of intent to set the vehicle in motion is <i>not</i> a defence. But the trial judge in effect made it so by basing his conclusion that there was no risk on evidence that the appellant did not intend to drive (2010 QCCQ 11443 (CanLII)).</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[61]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Court of Appeal for Quebec was correct to set aside the acquittals entered by the trial judge and to enter convictions (2011 QCCA 2071 (CanLII)). I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[68]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the text of the provision. “[C]are or control” are not technical legal words in this context. The ordinary sense of the word “care” denotes charge or protection while “control” denotes command and direction: see, e.g., <i>R. v. Price</i> (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 378 (N.B.S.C., App. Div.), at pp. 383-84; <i>R. v. Johal</i> (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 249 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), at p. 253. It follows that if the ordinary meaning of these words applies, one is in care or control of a motor vehicle when one acts to assume the present ability to operate the vehicle or has its superintendence or management.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[69]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The scheme and object of the provision suggest that Parliament intended the ordinary meaning to apply. The purpose of criminalizing having care or control of a vehicle while impaired (or over .08) is preventive.&nbsp; While the evil is the danger of impaired operation of a vehicle, a wider ambit of criminality has been created to prevent that evil from materializing. The unanimous Court, speaking through Fauteux J., commented on this preventive purpose in <i>Saunders v. The Queen</i>, [1967] S.C.R. 284, at pp. 289-90:</p>

 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the intention to set the vehicle in motion an ingredient of the offence of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired, or is the absence of such intention simply a way for an accused to rebut the presumption of care or control? This Court settled the question in <i>Ford v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 231, when Ritchie J. for the majority held that the intention to set the vehicle in motion is not an element of the offence. <u>Proof of lack of intention is simply an evidentiary point that rebuts the presumption of care or control of the vehicle established by s. 237(1)(<i>a</i>).</u> The Court recently reaffirmed <i>Ford</i> in <i>R. v. Toews</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119. [Emphasis added; p. 17.]</p>
 <p class="ContinueParaSuitedupar-AltP">In <i>Toews</i>, McIntyre J. also held that the absence of intent to drive did not afford the accused any <i>defence </i>to the infraction of care or control (p. 124).</p>

Since the intention of driving the vehicle is not pertinent under the care or control offence, the risk must be assessed by looking at the accused’s use of the vehicle.&nbsp; Indeed, risk should not be assessed on the premise that the accused’s actions will accord with his or her intentions. In my view, if an accused acts to assume the present ability to operate the vehicle or its superintendence or management, there is an inherent risk of danger, unless objectively viewed, the accused’s use of the vehicle involves no such risk.&nbsp; As Lamer C.J. wrote in <i>Penno</i>, at p. 877, “when a person uses a vehicle in a way that involves no risk of putting it in motion so that it could become dangerous, the courts should find that the <i>actus reus </i>was not present”.</p>

Courts should not assess mechanistically the numbers and nature of the acts performed by the accused. Rather, the determination of whether the accused was in care or control will depend upon a careful consideration of the particular facts of the case. As this Court held in <i>Toews</i>, at p. 126, “Each case will depend on its own facts and the circumstances in which acts of care or control may be found will vary widely.”</p>

It is difficult to imagine a case falling more squarely within the preventive purpose of the care and control provision.&nbsp; The preventive function of the provision is not to encourage finely tuned legal debates about the characterization of a risk that could materialize: the provision seeks to prevent the risk from materializing by criminalizing a wider array of conduct in which that risk is likely to be, but may not in fact be present.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[77]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague is of the view that the Court’s decisions in <i>Toews</i> and <i>Penno</i> incorporate a risk of danger as an element of the offence. I respectfully disagree. There was a clear statement to the contrary in <i>Saunders</i>, where Fauteux J. ruled, at p. 290, that nothing in this provision “indicate[d] an intent of Parliament to exact, in every case, as being one of the ingredients of the offences, the proof of the presence of some element of <u>actual or potential danger</u> or to accept, as a valid defense, the absence of any” (emphasis added). We ought not to assume that later decisions of the Court intended to depart from this statement absent some clear intention to do so.&nbsp; However, as I see it, no subsequent decision of the Court evidences any disagreement with <i>Saunders </i>on this point.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[78]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Saunders </i>has not been overtaken by subsequent decisions of this Court. Rather, as stated above, this Court has consistently interpreted the object of this provision as preventing the risk of danger that arises when alcohol and motor vehicles are combined. Thus, the provisions on drinking and driving seek to address a social problem which our society has been struggling with for years. As Lamer C.J. noted in <i>Penno</i>, at pp. 882-83:</p>
 <p class="Citation-AltC" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:-58.3pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The measure is part of the scheme set up by Parliament to protect the security and property of the public that are put to risk by persons whose ability to drive is impaired but who are, in any event, in care or control of a motor vehicle. . . . The social concern, common to the “drinking and driving” family of offences, is the severe risk to life, security or property of the public that is posed by persons whose ability to drive is impaired, but who are nevertheless in control of a motor vehicle. This concern was recognised by this Court to be of great importance in <i>Curr v. The Queen</i>, [1972] S.C.R. 889, <i>R. v. Hufsky</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621, <i>R. v. Thomsen</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, and in <i>Whyte</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 27.</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[80]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ford</i>, the evidence was that the intoxicated accused had been in and out of his stationary vehicle a number of times and had started and turned it off on a number of occasions over the course of the evening. The trial judge found as fact that the accused had agreed that someone else would drive the car when it came time to move it and that he had no intention of driving the vehicle. Nonetheless, the trial judge was found to have erred in law because he found that the accused’s absence of any intention to drive was a defence and the case was remitted for trial.&nbsp; Ritchie J. held there was care or control where “an accused performs some act or series of acts involving the use of the car, its fittings or equipment, such as occurred in this case, whereby the vehicle may unintentionally be set in motion creating the danger the section is designed to prevent” (p. 249). There was no expression of any disagreement with <i>Saunders</i>. Given the facts of the case and the absence of disagreement with <i>Saunders</i>, I would read the decision as simply referring to the purpose of the broad definition of care or control in the provision rather than as reading in a new essential element of the offence.</p>

The accused had been found asleep in a sleeping bag on the front seat of his truck. While the key was in the ignition, the evidence was that the last driver of the vehicle was a friend. The Court concluded that the accused was unconscious and therefore not in <i>de facto</i> care or control and, given that there was no evidence that it had been the accused who had put the key in the ignition, it had not been shown that the accused had performed <i>any</i> acts of care or control. The case did not turn on the absence of risk and there was no disapproval of the Court’s earlier decision in <i>Saunders</i>. In my opinion, the Court simply linked the element of care or control to its objective; the Court did not read into the provision a new essential element.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[82]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Penno</i>, the issue was whether the accused could raise the defence of intoxication to the care or control offence.&nbsp; On the issue of what constitutes care or control, Lamer C.J., writing for himself, noted that <i>Toews</i> “stands for the proposition that when a person <u>uses a vehicle in a way</u> that involves no risk of putting it in motion so that it could become dangerous, the courts should find that the <i>actus reus</i> was not present” (p. 877 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; Importantly, however, Lamer C.J. added that the Court in <i>Toews</i> “did <u>not</u> base its decision on the absence of <i>mens rea</i> that would derive from the accused’s intent to use the vehicle for another purpose than to use it as a motor vehicle, that is to use it as a bedroom” (p. 877 (emphasis added)).&nbsp; Rather Mr. Toews’ acquittal was based on the fact that there was <i>no evidence that he had performed any acts of care or control</i> and therefore had not performed the <i>actus reus</i> (p. 877).</p>

Some of the appellate courts which have favoured reading in risk as an essential element have done so to avoid what they perceive to be the over-inclusiveness that may result from giving the&nbsp; expression “care or control” its ordinary meaning in this provision. For example, in <i>Mallery</i>, at para. 47, the court relied on <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> considerations in adopting danger as an element of the offence. My colleague Fish J. cites Robertson J.A., at para. 4 of that case, to the effect that incorporating the concept of risk of danger serves to balance the rights of an accused with the objectives of the legislation. My colleague also notes that interpreting the provision to mean that the risk of danger is merely theoretically possible as opposed to realistic would be “to adopt too low a threshold since it would criminalize unnecessarily a broad range of benign and inconsequential conduct” (para. 35). Respectfully, however, this approach to interpretation is wrong in law.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[85]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well established that absent ambiguity in the statutory text, the courts should not apply an interpretative presumption of <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> compliance: see, e.g., <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 62. Applying such a presumption pre-empts judicial review and the possibility of resort to the justification of limiting provisions under <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec1" target="_blank">s. 1<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a> of the <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>.&nbsp; The appropriate context in which to assess whether Parliament has appropriately balanced the rights of the accused is in a <i><a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en" target="_blank">Charter<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i> challenge to the legislation, not in the course of interpreting an unambiguous statutory text.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[86]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, Parliament chose to use the words “care or control” which are everyday words with a well-settled meaning. No one has suggested that they are in any way ambiguous. Moreover, as discussed earlier, the broad meaning of care or control is consistent with Parliament’s preventive purpose: the net of criminality has been cast widely in order to avoid the inherent risk of the interaction of alcohol and automobiles. My colleague, however, would interpret the expression “care or control” in order to narrow it, so that it means that the circumstances must give rise to a realistic risk of danger to persons or property. Having read in this new essential element to narrow the ordinary meaning of the words “care or control”, my colleague would then create a new evidentiary rule.&nbsp; As my colleague expresses it at para. 13, “Absent evidence to the contrary, a present ability to drive while impaired, or with an excessive blood alcohol ratio, creates an inherent risk of danger.” Or, as expressed at para. 46, “[a]nyone who is intoxicated and in a position to immediately set the vehicle in motion faces conviction on those facts alone.” It is unclear what sort of burden the accused bears under this approach.&nbsp; At para. 13, it appears that the accused simply bears a tactical burden of adducing evidence tending to prove that the inherent risk is not a realistic risk in the particular circumstance. However, one gets a different impression from para. 41.&nbsp; There, it is proposed that “an intention to set the vehicle in motion suffices in itself to create the risk of danger contemplated by the offence of care or control.&nbsp; On the other hand, an accused <u>who satisfies the court</u> that he or she had no intention to set the vehicle in motion will not necessarily escape conviction” (underlining added; italics deleted). I understand this to mean that once the Crown has proved an intention to drive, the accused must disprove it but even then will not necessarily escape conviction. Thus, the intention to drive, which under our consistent jurisprudence is not an essential element of the offence, becomes a fact that if established by the Crown, requires conviction unless the accused establishes the contrary — and even then, he or she may not be acquitted. In my respectful view, this is not a result that can be reached through statutory interpretation.</p>
 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[87]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would emphasize that to give the expression “care or control” its normal meaning does not result in an offence of strict liability.&nbsp; There can be no care or control where, as for example in<i> Toews</i>, there are no acts of care or control by the accused. The issue of whether an accused, whose only acts in relation to the vehicle occurred while it was inoperable, can be said to be in care or control has not been resolved by this Court;<i> Saunders</i> simply held that an inoperable motor vehicle was nonetheless a motor vehicle within the definition then contained in the<i> <a class="reflex2-link" href="https://qweri.lexum.com/w/calegis/rsc-1985-c-c-46-en" target="_blank">Criminal Code<span class="decisia-reflex2-icon">&nbsp;<span class="icon-external-link"></span></span></a></i>. In this case the vehicle was operable and I would leave the issue of care or control in the case of an inoperable vehicle to another day when the point is both pertinent and fully argued.</p>

The trial judge erred in law in holding that there was no risk of putting the vehicle in motion since the accused did not have the intention to do so. Although the trial judge correctly noted at para. 38 of his reasons that the absence of intention to put the vehicle in motion did not constitute a defence for the accused, he in effect made it so. He held that there was no risk <i>because</i> the accused did not intend to drive:</p>

 <p class="ParaNoNdepar-AltN" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">[91]<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having found this legal error, the Court of Appeal was correct to set aside the acquittals and enter convictions. When applying the correct legal test, care or control was amply proved here.<i> </i>When the police found the appellant, he was sleeping behind the driver’s seat, the keys in the ignition, the engine running. The evidence was that he was the one who turned on the engine of the vehicle. By his presence in the driver’s seat of a running vehicle that he had started, he had the ability to operate the vehicle, and had its superintendence or management. By placing himself behind the wheel of the truck and by starting the engine, he clearly committed acts of care or control in relation to the vehicle. On being awakened by the police behind the wheel of his vehicle with its engine running, he asked that he be left alone <i>so that he could drive home</i>.&nbsp; There is no dispute that his blood alcohol ratio was<i> </i>over the legal limit at the time. The evidence was that the first test undertaken by the police officers revealed a blood alcohol content of 250 mg per 100 mL of blood and the second test revealed a blood alcohol content of 242 mg per 100 mL of blood.</p>
